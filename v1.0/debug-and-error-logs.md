If you need to [troubleshoot](troubleshooting-overview.html) issues with your cluster, you can check a node's logs, which include details about certain node-level and range-level events, such as errors. For example, if CockroachDB crashes, it normally logs a stack trace to what caused the problem.


## Details

When a node processes a [`cockroach` command](cockroach-commands.html), it produces a stream of messages about the command's activities. Each message's body describes the activity, and its envelope contains metadata such as the message's severity level.

As a command generates messages, CockroachDB uses the [command](#commands)'s [logging flags](#flags) and the message's [severity level](#severity-levels) to determine the appropriate [location](#output-locations) for it.

Each node's logs detail only the internal activity of that node without visibility into the behavior of other nodes in the cluster. When troubleshooting, this means that you must identify the node where the problem occurred or [collect the logs from all active nodes in your cluster](debug-zip.html).

### Commands

All [`cockroach` commands](cockroach-commands.html) support logging. However, it's important to note:

- `cockroach start` generates most messages related to the operation of your cluster.
- Other commands do generate messages, but they're typically only interesting in troubleshooting scenarios.

### Severity Levels

CockroachDB identifies each message with a severity level, letting operators know if they need to intercede:

1. `INFO` *(lowest severity; no action necessary)*
2. `WARNING`
3. `ERROR`
4. `FATAL` *(highest severity; requires operator attention)*

**Default Behavior by Severity Level**

Command | `INFO` messages | `WARNING` and above messages
--------|--------|--------------------
[`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) | Write to file | Write to file
[All other commands](cockroach-commands.html) | Discard | Print to `stderr`

### Output Locations

Based on the command's flags and the message's [severity level](#severity-levels), CockroachDB does one of the following:

- [Writes the message to a file](#write-to-file)
- [Prints it to `stderr`](#print-to-stderr)
- [Discards the message entirely](#discard-message)

#### Write to File

CockroachDB can write messages to log files, which use the following format:

~~~
cockroach.[host].[user].[start timestamp in system time].[process ID].log
~~~

Property | `cockroach start` | All other commands
---------|-------------------|-------------------
Enabled by | Default<sup>1</sup> | Explicit `--log-dir` flag
Default File Destination | `[first `[`store`](start-a-node.html#store)` dir]/logs` | *N/A*
Change File Destination | `--log-dir=[destination]` | `--log-dir=[destination]`
Default Severity Level Threshold | `INFO` | *N/A*
Change Severity Threshold | `--log-file-verbosity=[severity level]` | `--log-file-verbosity=[severity level]`
Disabled by | `--log-dir=""`<sup>1</sup> | Default

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}<sup>1</sup> If the <code>cockroach</code> process does not have access to on-disk storage, <code>cockroach start</code> does not write messages to log files; instead it prints all messages to <code>stderr</code>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Print to `stderr`

CockroachDB can print messages to `stderr`, which normally prints them to the machine's terminal but does not store them.

Property | `cockroach start` | All other commands
---------|-------------------|-------------------
Enabled by | Explicit `--logtostderr` flag<sup>2</sup> | Default
Default Severity Level Threshold | *N/A* | `WARNING`
Change Severity Threshold | `--logtostderr=[severity level]` | `--logtostderr=[severity level]`
Disabled by | Default<sup>2</sup> | `--logtostderr=NONE`

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}<sup>2</sup> <code>cockroach start</code> does not print any messages to <code>stderr</code> unless the <code>cockroach</code> process does not have access to on-disk storage, in which case it defaults to <code>--logtostderr=INFO</code> and prints all messages to <code>stderr</code>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Discard Message

Messages with severity levels below the `--logtostderr` and `--log-file-verbosity` flag's values are neither written to files nor printed to `stderr`, so they are discarded.

By default, commands besides `cockroach start` discard messages with the `INFO` [severity level](#severity-levels).

## Flags

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/logging-flags.md %}

The `--log-backtrace-at`, `--verbosity`, and `--v` flags are intended for internal debugging by CockroachDB contributors.

## Log Queries

To help troubleshoot [query performance issues](query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#performance-issues), you can use [cluster-wide settings](cluster-settings.html) to enable logging for long-running SQL transactions or all queries, regardless of time.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}These settings makes <em>all</em> queries slower and causes nodes to consume more memory. You should <a href="#disable-query-logging">disable query logging</a> as soon as you're done troubleshooting the query's issues.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Enable Query Logging

- **Long-running transactions**:

    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold = '[time]';
    ~~~

    The `[time]` parameter accepts common time specifiers, such as `100ms` or `2s`.

- **All queries**:

    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.trace.log_statement_execute = true;
    ~~~

### Details

After you enable query logging, whenever nodes process SQL statements, they generate messages with an `INFO` [severity level](#severity-levels).

By default, these messages will get [written to files](#write-to-file), but are ultimate handled by whatever logging behavior you set for [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html#logging).

### Improve Query Performance

After finding which queries are slow, use [`EXPLAIN`](explain.html) to examine them. It's possible that the query is slow because it performs a full-table scan. In these cases, you can likely improve the query's performance by [adding an index](create-index.html).

*(More guidance around query performance optimization forthcoming.)*

### Disable Query Logging

Once you're done troubleshooting, you should disable query logging to prevent it from unnecessarily consuming resources.

- **Long-running transactions**:

    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold = '0s';
    ~~~

- **All queries**:

    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.trace.log_statement_execute = false;
    ~~~
