To start a new CockroachDB cluster, or add a node to an existing cluster, run the `cockroach start` [command](cockroach-commands.html) with appropriate flags.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}Node-level settings are defined by flags passed to the <code>cockroach start</code> command and cannot be changed without stopping and restarting the node. In contrast, some cluster-wide settings are defined via SQL statements and can be updated anytime after a cluster has been started. For more details, see <a href="cluster-settings.html">Cluster Settings</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}


## Synopsis

~~~ shell
# Start the first node of a cluster:
$ cockroach start <flags, excluding --join>

# Add a node to a cluster:
$ cockroach start <flags, including --join>

# View help:
$ cockroach start --help
~~~

## Flags

The `start` command supports the following [general-use](#general) and
[logging](#logging) flags. All flags must be specified each time the
node is started, as they will not be remembered, with the exception of
the `--join` flag. Nevertheless, we recommend specifying
_all_ flags every time, including the `--join` flag, as that will
allow restarted nodes to join the cluster even if their data directory
was destroyed.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}When adding a node to an existing cluster, include the <code>--join</code> flag.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### General

Flag | Description
-----|-----------
`--advertise-host` | The hostname or IP address to advertise to other CockroachDB nodes. If it is a hostname, it must be resolvable from all nodes; if it is an IP address, it must be routable from all nodes.<br><br>When this flag is not set, the node advertises the address in the `--host` flag.
`--attrs` | Arbitray strings, separated by colons, specifying node capability, which might include specialized hardware or number of cores, for example:<br><br>`--attrs=ram:64gb`<br><br>These can be used to influence the location of data replicas. See [Configure Replication Zones](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) for full details.
`--background` | Set this to start the node in the background. This is better than appending `&` to the command because control is returned to the shell only once the node is ready to accept requests. <br /><br /> **Note:** `--background` is suitable for writing automated test suites or maintenance procedures that need a temporary server process running in the background. It is not intended to be used to start a long-running server, because it does not fully detach from the controlling terminal.  Consider using a service manager or a tool like [daemon(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=daemon&sektion=8) instead.
`--cache` | The total size for caches, shared evenly if there are multiple storage devices. This can be in any bytes-based unit, for example: <br><br>`--cache=1000000000 ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--cache=1GB ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--cache=1GiB ----> 1073741824 bytes` <br><br>**Default:** 25% of total system memory (excluding swap), or 512MiB if the memory size cannot be determined
`--certs-dir` | The path to the [certificate directory](create-security-certificates.html). The directory must contain valid certificates if running in secure mode.<br><br>**Default:** `${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/`
`--host` | The hostname or IP address to listen on for intra-cluster and client communication. The node will also advertise itself to other nodes using this address only if `--advertise-host` is not specified; in this case, if it is a hostname, it must be resolvable from all nodes, and if it is an IP address, it must be routable from all nodes.<br><br>**Default:** Listen on all interfaces, but this flag can be set to listen on an external address
`--http-host` | The hostname or IP address to listen on for Admin UI HTTP requests. <br><br>**Default:** same as `--host`
`--http-port` | The port to bind to for Admin UI HTTP requests. <br><br>**Default:** `8080`
`--insecure` | Run in insecure mode. If this flag is not set, the `--certs-dir` flag must point to valid certificates.<br><br><strong>Note the following risks:</strong> An insecure cluster is open to any client that can access any node's IP addresses; any user, even `root`, can log in without providing a password; any user, connecting as `root`, can read or write any data in your cluster; and there is no network encryption or authentication, and thus no confidentiality.<br><br>**Default:** `false`
`--join`<br>`-j` | The address for connecting the node to an existing cluster. When starting the first node, leave this flag out. When starting subsequent nodes, set this flag to the address of any existing node.<br><br>Optionally, you can specify the addresses of multiple existing nodes as a comma-separated list, using multiple `--join` flags, or using a combination of these approaches, for example: <br><br>`--join=localhost:1234,localhost:2345`<br>`--join=localhost:1234 --join=localhost:2345`<br>`--join=localhost:1234,localhost:2345 --join=localhost:3456`
`--listening-url-file` | The file to which the node's SQL connection URL will be written on successful startup, in addition to being printed to the [standard output](#standard-output).<br><br>This is particularly helpful in identifying the node's port when an unused port is assigned automatically (`--port=0`).
`--locality` | Arbitrary key-value pairs that describe the locality of the node. Locality might include country, region, datacenter, rack, etc.<br><br>CockroachDB attempts to spread replicas evenly across the cluster based on locality, with the order determining the priority. The keys themselves and the order of key-value pairs must be the same on all nodes, for example:<br><br>`--locality=region=east,datacenter=us-east-1`<br>`--locality=region=west,datacenter=us-west-1`<br><br>These can be used to influence the location of data replicas. See [Configure Replication Zones](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) for full details.
`--max-offset` | The maximum allowed clock offset for the cluster. If observed clock offsets exceed this limit, servers will crash to minimize the likelihood of reading inconsistent data. Increasing this value will increase the time to recovery of failures as well as the frequency of uncertainty-based read restarts.<br><br>Note that this value must be the same on all nodes in the cluster and cannot be changed with a [rolling upgrade](upgrade-cockroach-version.html). In order to change it, first stop every node in the cluster. Then once the entire cluster is offline, restart each node with the new value.<br><br>**Default:** 500ms
`--max-sql-memory` | The total size for storage of temporary data for SQL clients, including prepared queries and intermediate data rows during query execution. This can be in any bytes-based unit, for example:<br><br>`--max-sql-memory=10000000000 ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--max-sql-memory=1GB ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--max-sql-memory=1GiB ----> 1073741824 bytes`<br><br>**Default:** 25% of total system memory (excluding swap), or 512MiB if the memory size cannot be determined
`--pid-file` | The file to which the node's process ID will be written on successful startup. When this flag is not set, the process ID is not written to file.
`--port`<br>`-p` | The port to bind to for internal and client communication.<br><br>To have an unused port assigned automatically, pass `--port=0`.<br><br>**Env Variable:** `COCKROACH_PORT`<br>**Default:** `26257`
`--store`<br>`-s` | The file path to a storage device and, optionally, store attributes and maximum size. When using multiple storage devices for a node, this flag must be specified separately for each device, for example: <br><br>`--store=/mnt/ssd01 --store=/mnt/ssd02` <br><br>For more details, see [`store`](#store) below.

### Logging

By default, `cockroach start` writes all messages to log files, and prints nothing to `stderr`. However, you can control the process's [logging](debug-and-error-logs.html) behavior with the following flags:

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/logging-flags.md %}

#### Defaults

`cockroach start` uses the equivalent values for these logging flags by default:

- `--log-dir=<first store dir>/logs`
- `--logtostderr=NONE`

This means, by default, CockroachDB writes all messages to log files, and never prints to `stderr`.

### `store`

The `store` flag supports the following fields. Note that commas are used to separate fields, and so are forbidden in all field values.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}In-memory storage is not suitable for production deployments at this time.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Field | Description
------|------------
`type` | For in-memory storage, set this field to `mem`; otherwise, leave this field out. The `path` field must not be set when `type=mem`.
`path` | The file path to the storage device. When not setting `attr` or `size`, the `path` field label can be left out: <br><br>`--store=/mnt/ssd01` <br><br>When either of those fields are set, however, the `path` field label must be used: <br><br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GB` <br><br> **Default:** `cockroach-data`
`attrs` | Arbitrary strings, separated by colons, specifying disk type or capability. These can be used to influence the location of data replicas. See [Configure Replication Zones](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) for full details.<br><br>In most cases, node-level `--locality` or `--attrs` are preferable to store-level attributes, but this field can be used to match capabilities for storage of individual databases or tables. For example, an OLTP database would probably want to allocate space for its tables only on solid state devices, whereas append-only time series might prefer cheaper spinning drives. Typical attributes include whether the store is flash (`ssd`) or spinny disk (`hdd`), as well as speeds and other specs, for example:<br><br> `--store=path=/mnt/hda1,attrs=hdd:7200rpm`
`size` | The maximum size allocated to the node. When this size is reached, CockroachDB attempts to rebalance data to other nodes with available capacity. When there's no capacity elsewhere, this limit will be exceeded. Also, data may be written to the node faster than the cluster can rebalance it away; in this case, as long as capacity is available elsewhere, CockroachDB will gradually rebalance data down to the store limit.<br><br> The `size` can be specified either in a bytes-based unit or as a percentage of hard drive space, for example: <br><br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=10000000000 ----> 10000000000 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GB ----> 20000000000 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GiB ----> 21474836480 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.02TiB ----> 21474836480 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20% ----> 20% of available space`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.2 ----> 20% of available space`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=.2 ----> 20% of available space`<br><br>**Default:** 100%<br><br>For an in-memory store, the `size` field is required and must be set to the true maximum bytes or percentage of available memory, for example:<br><br>`--store=type=mem,size=20GB`<br>`--store=type=mem,size=90%`

## Standard Output

When you run `cockroach start`, some helpful details are printed to the standard output:

~~~ shell
CockroachDB node starting at {{page.release_info.start_time}}
build:      CCL {{page.release_info.version}} @ {{page.release_info.build_time}}

~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}These details are also written to the <code>INFO</code> log in the <code>/logs</code> directory in case you need to refer to them at a later time.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Field | Description
------|------------
`build` | The version of CockroachDB you are running.
`admin` | The URL for accessing the Admin UI.
`sql` | The connection URL for your client.
`logs` | The directory containing debug log data.
`attrs` | If node-level attributes were specified in the `--attrs` flag, they are listed in this field. These details are potentially useful for [configuring replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html).
`locality` | If values describing the locality of the node were specified in the `--locality` field, they are listed in this field. These details are potentially useful for [configuring replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html).
`store[n]` | The directory containing store data, where `[n]` is the index of the store, e.g., `store[0]` for the first store, `store[1]` for the second store.<br><br>If store-level attributes were specified in the `attrs` field of the [`--store`](#store) flag, they are listed in this field as well. These details are potentially useful for [configuring replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html).
`status` | Whether the node is the first in the cluster (`initialized new cluster`), joined an existing cluster for the first time (`initialized new node, joined pre-existing cluster`), or rejoined an existing cluster (`restarted pre-existing node`).
`clusterID` | The ID of the cluster.<br><br>When trying to join a node to an existing cluster, if this ID is different than the ID of the existing cluster, the node has started a new cluster. This may be due to conflicting information in the node's data directory. For additional guidance, see the [troubleshooting](cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#node-will-not-join-cluster) docs.
`nodeID` | The ID of the node.

## Examples

### Start a local cluster

This example demonstrates starting up three nodes locally. See [Start a Local Cluster (Insecure)](start-a-local-cluster.html) and [Start a Local Cluster (Secure)](secure-a-cluster.html) for a detailed walkthrough.

~~~ shell
# Insecure:
$ cockroach start --insecure
$ cockroach start --insecure --store=node2 --port=26258 --http-port=8081 --join=localhost:26257
$ cockroach start --insecure --store=node3 --port=26259 --http-port=8082 --join=localhost:26257

# Secure:
$ cockroach start --certs-dir=certs --http-host=localhost --background
$ cockroach start --certs-dir=certs --store=node2 --port=26258 --http-host=localhost --http-port=8081 --join=localhost:26257
$ cockroach start --certs-dir=certs --store=node3 --port=26259 --http-host=localhost --http-port=8082 --join=localhost:26257
~~~

### Start a distributed cluster

This example demonstrates starting up three nodes on different machines. Because each is on a different machine, default ports can be used without causing conflict. See [Manual Deployment](manual-deployment.html) for a detailed walkthrough.

<style>
.pg::before {
    content: "test";
}
.pg::after {
    content: "test2";
}
</style>
~~~ shell
# Insecure:
$ cockroach start --insecure --host=<node1-hostname>
$ cockroach start --insecure --host=<node2-hostname> --join=<node1-hostname>:26257
$ cockroach start --insecure --host=<node3-hostname> --join=<node1-hostname>:26257

# Secure:
$ cockroach start --certs-dir=certs --host=<node1-hostname> --http-host=<private-address>
$ cockroach start --certs-dir=certs --host=<node2-hostname> --http-host=<private-address> --join=<node1-hostname>:26257
$ cockroach start --certs-dir=certs --host=<node3-hostname> --http-host=<private-address> --join=<node1-hostname>:26257
