Orchestration systems automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Combined with CockroachDB's [automated sharding](frequently-asked-questions.html#how-does-cockroachdb-scale) and [fault tolerance](frequently-asked-questions.html#how-does-cockroachdb-survive-failures), they have the potential to lower operator overhead to almost nothing.

Use the following guides to run CockroachDB with popular open-source orchestration systems:
