This page shows you how to orchestrate the deployment and management of an insecure three-node CockroachDB cluster as a [swarm of Docker Engines](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

If you plan to use CockroachDB in production, we recommend using a secure cluster instead. Select **Secure** above for instructions.

<div id="toc"></div>

## Before You Begin

Before you begin, it's helpful to review some terminology:

Feature | Description
--------|------------
instance | A physical or virtual machine. In this tutorial, you'll use three, one per CockroachDB node.
[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) | This is the core Docker application that creates and runs containers. In this tutorial, you'll install and start Docker Engine on each of your three instances.
[swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/#/swarm) | A swarm is a group of Docker Engines joined into a single, virtual host.
[swarm node](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/) | Each member of a swarm is considered a node. In this tutorial, each instance will be a swarm node, one as the master node and the two others as worker nodes. You'll submit service definitions to the master node, which will dispatch work to the worker nodes.
[service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/) | A service is the definition of the tasks to execute on swarm nodes. In this tutorial, you'll define three services, each starting a CockrochDB node inside a container and joining it into a single cluster. Each service also ensures a stable network identity on restart via a resolvable DNS name.
[overlay network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/#/an-overlay-network-with-docker-engine-swarm-mode) | An overlay network enables communication between the nodes of a swarm. In this tutorial, you'll create an overlay network and use it in each of your services.

## Step 1. Create instances

Create three instances, one for each node of your cluster.

- For GCE-specific instructions, read through step 2 of [Deploy CockroachDB on GCE](deploy-cockroachdb-on-google-cloud-platform-insecure.html).
- For AWS-specific instructions, read through step 2 of [Deploy CockroachDB on AWS](deploy-cockroachdb-on-aws-insecure.html).

Be sure to configure your network to allow TCP communication on these ports:

- `26257` for inter-node communication (i.e., working as a cluster) and connecting with applications
- `8080` for exposing your Admin UI

## Step 2. Install Docker Engine

On each instance:

1. [Install and start Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

2. Confirm that the Docker daemon is running in the background:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker version
    ~~~

## Step 3. Start the swarm

1. On the instance where you want to run your manager node, [initialize the swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/).

    Take note of the output for `docker swarm init` as it includes the command you'll use in the next step. It should look like this:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.142.0.2
    ~~~

    ~~~
    Swarm initialized: current node (414z67gr5cgfalm4uriu4qdtm) is now a manager.

    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

      $ docker swarm join \
      --token SWMTKN-1-5vwxyi6zl3cc62lqlhi1jrweyspi8wblh2i3qa7kv277fgy74n-e5eg5c7ioxypjxlt3rpqorh15 \
      10.142.0.2:2377

    To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
    ~~~

2. On the other two instances, [create a worker node joined to the swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/add-nodes/) by running the `docker swarm join` command in the output from step 1, for example:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker swarm join \
         --token SWMTKN-1-5vwxyi6zl3cc62lqlhi1jrweyspi8wblh2i3qa7kv277fgy74n-e5eg5c7ioxypjxlt3rpqorh15 \
         10.142.0.2:2377
    ~~~

    ~~~
    This node joined a swarm as a worker.
    ~~~

3. On the instance running your manager node, verify that your swarm is running:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker node ls
    ~~~

    ~~~
    ID                           HOSTNAME    STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
    414z67gr5cgfalm4uriu4qdtm *  instance-1  Ready   Active        Leader
    ae144s35dx1p1lcegh6bblyed    instance-2  Ready   Active
    aivjg2joxyvzvbksjsix27khy    instance-3  Ready   Active
    ~~~

## Step 4. Create an overlay network

On the instance running your manager node, create an overlay network so that the containers in your swarm can talk to each other:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ sudo docker network create --driver overlay cockroachdb
~~~

## Step 5. Start the CockroachDB cluster

1. On the instance running your manager node, create the first service that the others will join to:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker service create \
    --replicas 1 \
    --name cockroachdb-1 \
    --hostname cockroachdb-1 \
    --network cockroachdb \
    --mount type=volume,source=cockroachdb-1,target=/cockroach/cockroach-data,volume-driver=local \
    --stop-grace-period 60s \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}} start \
    --logtostderr \
    --insecure
    ~~~

    This command creates a service that starts a container, joins it to the overlay network, and starts the first CockroachDB node inside the container mounted to a local volume for persistent storage. Let's look at each part:
    - `sudo docker service create`: The Docker command to create a new service.
    - `--replicas`: The number of containers controlled by the service. Since each service will control one container running one CockroachDB node, this will always be `1`.
    - `--name`: The name for the service.
    - `--hostname`: The hostname of the container. It will listen for connections on this address.
    - `--network`: The overlay network for the container to join. See [Step 4. Create an overlay network](#step-4-create-an-overlay-network) for more details.
    - `--mount`: This flag mounts a local volume called `cockroachdb-1`. This means that data and logs for the node running in this container will be stored in `/cockroach/cockroach-data` on the instance and will be reused on restart as long as restart happens on the same instance, which is not guaranteed.
     {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}If you plan on replacing or adding instances, it's recommended to use remote storage instead of local disk. To do so, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/">create a remote volume</a> for each CockroachDB instance using the volume driver of your choice, and then specify that volume driver instead of the <code>volume-driver=local</code> part of the command above, e.g., <code>volume-driver=gce</code> if using the <a href="https://github.com/mcuadros/gce-docker">GCE volume driver</a>.
    - `--stop-grace-period`: This flag sets a grace period to give CockroachDB enough time to shut down gracefully, when possible.
    - `--publish`: This flag makes the Admin UI accessible at the IP of any instance running a swarm node on port `8080`. Note that, even though this flag is defined only in the first node's service, the swarm exposes this port on every swarm node using a routing mesh. See [Publishing ports](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/services/#publish-ports) for more details.
    - `cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}} start ...`: The CockroachDB command to [start a node](start-a-node.html) in the container in insecure mode and instruct other cluster members to talk to it using its persistent network address, `cockroachdb-1`.

2. On the same instance, create the services to start two other CockroachDB nodes and join them to the cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    # Start the second service:
    $ sudo docker service create \
    --replicas 1 \
    --name cockroachdb-2 \
    --hostname cockroachdb-2 \
    --network cockroachdb \
    --mount type=volume,source=cockroachdb-2,target=/cockroach/cockroach-data,volume-driver=local \
    --stop-grace-period 60s \
    cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}} start \
    --join=cockroachdb-1:26257 \
    --logtostderr \
    --insecure
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    # Start the third service:
    $ sudo docker service create \
    --replicas 1 \
    --name cockroachdb-3 \
    --hostname cockroachdb-3 \
    --network cockroachdb \
    --mount type=volume,source=cockroachdb-3,target=/cockroach/cockroach-data,volume-driver=local \
    --stop-grace-period 60s \
    cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}} start \
    --join=cockroachdb-1:26257 \
    --logtostderr \
    --insecure
    ~~~

    There are only a few differences when creating the second two services:
    - The `--name` is unique for each service.
    - The CockroachDB command to [`start`](start-a-node.html) each node uses the the `--join` flag to connect it to the cluster via the name of the first service and its default port, `cockroachdb-1:26257`.

3. Verify that all three services were created successfully:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker service ls
    ~~~

    ~~~
    ID            NAME           MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
    a6g0ur6857j6  cockroachdb-1  replicated  1/1       cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}}
    dr81a756gaa6  cockroachdb-2  replicated  1/1       cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}}
    il4m7op1afg9  cockroachdb-3  replicated  1/1       cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}}
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}The service definitions tell the CockroachDB nodes to log to <code>stderr</code>, so if you ever need access to a node's logs for troubleshooting, use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/"><code>sudo docker logs &lt;container id&gt;</code></a> from the instance on which the container is running.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

4. Remove the first service and recreate it again with the `--join` flag to ensure that, if the first node restarts, it will rejoin the original cluster via the the second service, `cockroachdb-2`, instead of initiating a new cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker service rm cockroachdb-1
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker service create \
    --replicas 1 \
    --name cockroachdb-1 \
    --hostname cockroachdb-1 \
    --network cockroachdb \
    --mount type=volume,source=cockroachdb-1,target=/cockroach/cockroach-data,volume-driver=local \
    --stop-grace-period 60s \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}} start \
    --join=cockroachdb-2:26257 \
    --logtostderr \
    --insecure
    ~~~

## Step 6. Use the built-in SQL client

1. On any instance, use the `sudo docker ps` command to get the ID of the container running the CockroachDB node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker ps | grep cockroachdb
    ~~~

    ~~~
    9539871cc769        cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}}   "/cockroach/cockroach"   2 minutes ago        Up 2 minutes         8080/tcp, 26257/tcp   cockroachdb-1.1.0wigdh8lx0ylhuzm4on9bbldq
    ~~~

2. Use the `sudo docker exec` command to open the built-in SQL shell in interactive mode inside the container:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker exec -it 9539871cc769 ./cockroach sql --insecure
    ~~~

3. Create an `insecurenodetest` database:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE insecurenodetest;
    ~~~

4. Use **CTRL + D**, **CTRL + C**, or `\q` to exit the SQL shell.

## Step 7. Monitor the cluster

To view your cluster's Admin UI, open a browser and go to `http://<any node's external IP address>:8080`.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}It's possible to access the Admin UI from outside of the swarm because you published port <code>8080</code> externally in the first node's service definition.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

On this page, verify that the cluster is running as expected:

1. Click **View nodes list** on the right to ensure that all of your nodes successfully joined the cluster.

2. Click the **Databases** tab on the left to verify that `insecurenodetest` is listed.

## Step 8. Simulate node failure

Since we have three service definitions, one for each node, Docker Swarm will ensure that there are three nodes running at all times. If a node fails, Docker Swarm will automatically create another node with the same network identity and storage.

To see this in action:

1. On any instance, use the `sudo docker ps` command to get the ID of the container running the CockroachDB node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker ps | grep cockroachdb
    ~~~

    ~~~
    9539871cc769        cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}}   "/cockroach/cockroach"   10 minutes ago        Up 10 minutes         8080/tcp, 26257/tcp   cockroachdb-0.1.0wigdh8lx0ylhuzm4on9bbldq
    ~~~

2. Use `sudo docker kill` to remove the container, which implicitly stops the node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker kill 9539871cc769
    ~~~

3. Verify that the node was restarted in a new container:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo docker ps | grep cockroachdb
    ~~~

    ~~~
    4a58f86e3ced        cockroachdb/cockroach:{{page.release_info.version}}   "/cockroach/cockroach"   7 seconds ago       Up 1 seconds        8080/tcp, 26257/tcp   cockroachdb-0.1.cph86kmhhcp8xzq6a1nxtk9ng
    ~~~

4. Back in the Admin UI, click **View nodes list** on the right and verify that all 3 nodes are live.

## Step 9. Scale the cluster

To increase the number of nodes in your CockroachDB cluster:

1. Create an additional instance (see [Step 1](#step-1-create-instances)).
2. Install Docker Engine on the instance (see [Step 2](#step-2-install-docker-engine)).
3. Join the instance to the swarm as a worker node (see [Step 3.2](#step-3-start-the-swarm)).
4. Create a new service to start another node and join it to the CockroachDB cluster (see [Step 5.2](#step-5-start-the-cockroachdb-cluster)).

## Step 9. Stop the cluster

To stop the CockroachDB cluster, on the instance running your manager node, remove the services:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ sudo docker service rm cockroachdb-0 cockroachdb-1 cockroachdb-2
~~~

~~~
cockroachdb-0
cockroachdb-1
cockroachdb-2
~~~

You may want to remove the persistent volumes used by the services as well. To do this, on each instance:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
# Identify the name of the local volume:
$ sudo docker volume ls
~~~

~~~
cockroachdb-0
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
# Remove the local volume:
$ sudo docker volume rm cockroachdb-0
~~~
