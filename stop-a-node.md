title: Stop a Node
toc: false
---

To stop a CockroachDB node running in the background, run the `cockroach quit` [command](cockroach-commands.html) with appropriate flags. To stop a node running in the foreground, use **CTRL + C** or run `cockroach quit` from another shell. 

The `quit` command allows in-flight requests to complete and then shuts down the node. Once a node has been offline for approximately 5 minutes, CockroachDB automatically rebalances replicas from the missing node, using unaffected replicas on other nodes as sources.
