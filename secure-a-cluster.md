Now that you have a [local cluster](start-a-local-cluster.html) up and running, let's secure it with authentication and encryption. This involves stopping the cluster, creating certificates, and restarting nodes with a few additional flags.

1.  Stop the cluster and close the Admin UI:

    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit
    $ cockroach quit --port=26258
    $ cockroach quit --port=26259
    ~~~

    <button type="button" class="btn details collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-secure1">Details</button>
    <div id="details-secure1" class="collapse" markdown="1">

    - If you used the `cockroach start` commands on [Start a Cluster](start-a-local-cluster.html) verbatim, the commands above will work as well. Otherwise, just set the `--port` flag to the ports you used.
    - For more details about the `cockroach quit` command, see [Stop a Node](stop-a-node.html).
    - If you leave the Admin UI open, when you restart the cluster with security (steps 3 and 4), you'll see "TLS handshake" errors until you adjust the URL to https (step 7).

    </div>

2.  Create security certificates:

    ~~~ shell
    $ mkdir certs
    $ cockroach cert create-ca --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --ca-key=certs/ca.key
    $ cockroach cert create-node localhost $(hostname) --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --ca-key=certs/ca.key --cert=certs/node.cert --key=certs/node.key
    $ cockroach cert create-client root --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --ca-key=certs/ca.key --cert=certs/root.cert --key=certs/root.key
    ~~~

    <button type="button" class="btn details collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-secure2">Details</button>
    <div id="details-secure2" class="collapse" markdown="1">

    - The first command makes a new directory for the certificates.
    - The second command creates the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and key: `ca.cert` and `ca.key`.
    - The third command creates the node certificate and key: `node.cert` and `node.key`. These files will be used to secure communication between nodes. Typically, you would generate these separately for each node since each node has unique addresses; in this case, however, since all nodes will be running locally, you need to generate only one node certificate and key.
    - The fourth command creates the client certificate and key, in this case for the `root` user: `root.cert` and `root.key`. These files will be used to secure communication between the built-in SQL shell and the cluster (see step 5).
        
    </div>

3.  Restart the first node:
 
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --cert=certs/node.cert --key=certs/node.key --http-addr=127.0.0.1 --background

    build:     {{site.data.strings.version}} @ {{site.data.strings.build_time}}
    admin:     https://ROACHs-MBP:8080
    sql:       postgresql://root@ROACHs-MBP:26257?sslcert=%2FUsers%2F...
    logs:      cockroach-data/logs
    store[0]:  path=cockroach-data
    ~~~

    <button type="button" class="btn details collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-secure3">Details</button>
    <div id="details-secure3" class="collapse" markdown="1">

    This command restarts your first node with its existing data, but securely. The command is the same as before but now uses the additional `--ca-cert`, `--cert`, and `--key` flags to point to the CA certificate and the node certificate and key created in step 2. It also uses the --http-addr command to bind the http Admin UI to a non-public IP. This restricts access to the Admin UI to those who are authorized to establish an ssh tunnel to the host, as demonstrated below.

    </div>

4.  Restart additional nodes:

    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start --store=node2 --port=26258 --http-port=8081 --http-addr=127.0.0.1 --join=localhost:26257 --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --cert=certs/node.cert --key=certs/node.key --background
    $ cockroach start --store=node3 --port=26259 --http-port=8082 --http-addr=127.0.0.1 --join=localhost:26257 --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --cert=certs/node.cert --key=certs/node.key --background
    ~~~

    <button type="button" class="btn details collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-secure4">Details</button>
    <div id="details-secure4" class="collapse" markdown="1">

    These commands restart additional nodes with their existing data, but securely. The commands are the same as before but now uses the additional `--ca-cert`, `--cert`, and `--key` flags to point to the CA certificate and the node certificate and key created in step 2. The additional `--http-addr` restricts access to the http Admin UI interface, so that only local 127.0.0.1 or ssh-tunnelled administrators may access it.

    </div>

5.  Restart the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) as an interactive shell:

    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --ca-cert=certs/ca.cert --cert=certs/root.cert --key=certs/root.key
    # Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
    # All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
    # To exit: CTRL + D.
    ~~~

    <button type="button" class="btn details collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#details-secure5">Details</button>
    <div id="details-secure5" class="collapse" markdown="1">

    This command is the same as before, but now uses the additional `--ca-cert`, `--cert`, and `--key` flags point to the CA certificate and the certificate and key for the `root` user created in step 2.

    </div>

6.  Run more [CockroachDB SQL statements](learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

    ~~~ shell
    root@:26257> SET DATABASE = bank;
    SET DATABASE

    root@26257> SELECT * FROM accounts;
    +------+----------+
    |  id  | balance  |
    +------+----------+
    | 1234 | 10000.50 |
    +------+----------+

    root@26257> INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (5678, 250.75);
    INSERT 1

    root@26257> SELECT * FROM accounts;
    +------+----------+
    |  id  | balance  |
    +------+----------+
    | 1234 | 10000.50 |
    | 5678 | 250.75   |
    +------+----------+
    ~~~

    When you're done using the SQL shell, press **CTRL + D** to exit.
 
7.  Access the [Admin UI](explore-the-admin-ui.html) by first establishing an SSH tunnel for the http traffic from you laptop to the cockroach server by doing `ssh -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8080 ROACHs-MBP` at the shell prompt (substitute your first node's address for ROACHs-MBP). Note that you can and should skip the ssh tunnel if you are running cockroach locally on your laptop. Then point your browser at `https://127.0.0.1:8081`. You can find the address to tunnel to in the `admin` field in the standard output of any node on startup. 

    Note that your browser will consider the CockroachDB-created certificate invalid; youâ€™ll need to click through a warning message to get to the UI.
