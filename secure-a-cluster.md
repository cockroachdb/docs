Now that you've seen how easy it is to [start, use, and stop a local cluster](start-a-local-cluster.html), let's secure the cluster with authentication and encryption. This involves creating certificates and restarting nodes with a few additional flags.

<div id="toc"></div>

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have already [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html) and [started and stopped a local insecure cluster](start-a-local-cluster.html).

<!-- TODO: update the asciicast
Also, feel free to watch this process in action before going through the steps yourself. Note that you can copy commands directly from the video, and you can use **<** and **>** to go back and forward.

## Step 1.  Create security certificates

~~~ shell
# Create a certs directory and safe directory for the CA key.
# If using the default certificate directory (`${HOME}/.cockroach-certs`), make sure it is empty.
$ mkdir certs
$ mkdir my-safe-directory

# Create the CA key pair:
$ cockroach cert create-ca \
--certs-dir=certs \
--ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key

# Create a client key pair for the root user:
$ cockroach cert create-client \
root \
--certs-dir=certs \
--ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key

# Create a key pair for the nodes:
$ cockroach cert create-node \
localhost \
$(hostname) \
--certs-dir=certs \
--ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
~~~

- The first command makes a new directory for the certificates.
- The second command creates the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and key: `ca.crt` and `ca.key`.
- The third command creates the client certificate and key, in this case for the `root` user: `client.root.crt` and `client.root.key`. These files will be used to secure communication between the built-in SQL shell and the cluster (see step 4).
- The fourth command creates the node certificate and key: `node.crt` and `node.key`. These files will be used to secure communication between nodes. Typically, you would generate these separately for each node since each node has unique addresses; in this case, however, since all nodes will be running locally, you need to generate only one node certificate and key.

## Step 2.  Restart the first node

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --background \
--http-host=localhost \
--certs-dir=certs
~~~

~~~
CockroachDB node starting at {{site.data.strings.start_time}}
build:      CCL {{site.data.strings.version}} @ {{site.data.strings.build_time}}
admin:      https://ROACHs-MBP:8080
sql:        postgresql://root@ROACHs-MBP:26257?sslcert=%2FUsers%2F...
logs:       cockroach-data/logs
store[0]:   path=cockroach-data
status:     restarted pre-existing node
clusterID:  {dab8130a-d20b-4753-85ba-14d8956a294c}
nodeID:     1
~~~

This command restarts your first node with its existing data, but securely. The command is the same as before with the following additions:

- The `--certs-dir` directory points to the directory holding certificates and keys. It can be left out if you are using the default directory `${HOME}/.cockroach-certs`.
- The Admin UI defaults to listening on all interfaces. The `--http-host` flag is therefore used to restrict Admin UI access to the specified interface, in this case, `localhost`.

## Step 3.  Restart additional nodes

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --background \
--store=node2 \
--port=26258 \
--http-port=8081 \
--http-host=localhost \
--certs-dir=certs \
--join=localhost:26257

$ cockroach start --background \
--store=node3 \
--port=26259 \
--http-port=8082 \
--http-host=localhost \
--certs-dir=certs \
--join=localhost:26257
~~~

These commands restart additional nodes with their existing data, but securely. The commands are the same as before with the following additions:

- The `--certs-dir` directory points to the directory holding certificates and keys. It can be left out if you are using the default directory `${HOME}/.cockroach-certs`.
- The Admin UI defaults to listening on all interfaces. The `--http-host` flag is therefore used to restrict Admin UI access to the specified interface, in this case, `localhost`.

## Step 4.  Restart the built-in SQL client

~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql \
--certs-dir=certs
# Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit: CTRL + D.
~~~

This command is the same as before but now uses the additional `--certs-dir` flag to point to the directory holding certificates and keys.

## Step 5.  Run more CockroachDB SQL statements

~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |  1000.5 |
|  2 |    2000 |
|  3 |    3000 |
+----+---------+
(3 rows)
~~~

~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO bank.accounts VALUES (4, 250.75);

> SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |  1000.5 |
|  2 |    2000 |
|  3 |    3000 |
|  4 |  250.75 |
+----+---------+
(4 rows)
~~~

When you're done, press **CTRL + D** to exit the SQL shell.

## Step 6.  Access the Admin UI

Reopen the [Admin UI](explore-the-admin-ui.html) by pointing your browser to `https://localhost:8080`. You can also find the address in the `admin` field in the standard output of any node on startup.

Note that your browser will consider the CockroachDB-created certificate invalid; youâ€™ll need to click through a warning message to get to the UI.

## Step 7.  Stop the cluster

You can stop the nodes (and therefore the cluster) as follows:

~~~ shell
# Stop node 1:
$ cockroach quit \
--host=localhost \
--certs-dir=certs

# Stop node 2:
$ cockroach quit \
--host=localhost \
--port=26258 \
--certs-dir=certs
~~~

With only 1 node online, a majority of replicas are no longer available, and so the cluster is not operational. As a result, you can't use `cockroach quit` to stop the last node, but instead must get the node's process ID and then force kill it:

~~~ shell
# Get the process ID for node 3:
$ ps | grep cockroach
~~~

~~~
12897 ttys001    0:00.48 cockroach start --store=node3 --port=26259 --http-port=8082 --http-host=localhost --certs-dir=certs --join=localhost:26257
~~~

~~~ shell
# Force quit the process:
$ kill -9 12897
~~~
