A view is a stored and named [selection query](selection-queries.html). By default, CockroachDB's views are **dematerialized**: they do not store the results of the underlying queries. Instead, the underlying query is executed anew every time the view is used.

 CockroachDB also supports [**materialized views**](#materialized-views). Materialized views are views that store their selection query results.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
 By default, views created in a database cannot reference objects in a different database. To enable cross-database references for views, set the `sql.cross_db_views.enabled` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) to `true`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Why use views?

There are various reasons to use views, including:

- [Hide query complexity](#hide-query-complexity)
- [Limit access to underlying data](#limit-access-to-underlying-data)

### Hide query complexity

When you have a complex query that, for example, joins several tables, or performs complex calculations, you can store the query as a view and then select from the view as you would from a standard table.

#### Example

Let's say you're using our [sample `startrek` database](cockroach-gen.html#generate-example-data), which contains two tables, `episodes` and `quotes`.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> USE startrek;
~~~

There's a foreign key constraint between the `episodes.id` column and the `quotes.episode` column. To count the number of famous quotes per season, you could run the following join:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT episodes.season, count(*)
  FROM quotes
  JOIN episodes
  ON quotes.episode = episodes.id
  GROUP BY episodes.season;
~~~

~~~
  season | count
---------+--------
       1 |    78
       2 |    76
       3 |    46
(3 rows)
~~~

Alternatively, to make it much easier to run this complex query, you could create a view:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE VIEW quotes_per_season (season, quotes)
  AS SELECT episodes.season, count(*)
  FROM quotes
  JOIN episodes
  ON quotes.episode = episodes.id
  GROUP BY episodes.season
  ORDER BY episodes.season;
~~~

Then, executing the query is as easy as `SELECT`ing from the view:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM quotes_per_season;
~~~

~~~
  season | quotes
---------+---------
       1 |     78
       2 |     76
       3 |     46
(3 rows)
~~~

### Limit access to underlying data

When you do not want to grant a user access to all the data in one or more standard tables, you can create a view that contains only the columns and/or rows that the user should have access to and then grant the user permissions on the view.

#### Example

Let's say you have a `bank` database containing an `accounts` table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> USE bank;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM accounts;
~~~

~~~
  id |   type   | balance |      email
-----+----------+---------+------------------
   1 | checking |    1000 | max@roach.com
   2 | savings  |   10000 | max@roach.com
   3 | checking |   15000 | betsy@roach.com
   4 | checking |    5000 | lilly@roach.com
   5 | savings  |   50000 | ben@roach.com
(5 rows)
~~~

You want a particular user, `bob`, to be able to see the types of accounts each user has without seeing the balance in each account, so you create a view to expose just the `type` and `email` columns:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE VIEW user_accounts
  AS SELECT type, email
  FROM accounts;
~~~

You then make sure `bob` does not have privileges on the underlying `accounts` table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW GRANTS ON accounts;
~~~

~~~
  database_name | schema_name | table_name | grantee | privilege_type
----------------+-------------+------------+---------+-----------------
  bank          | public      | accounts   | admin   | ALL
  bank          | public      | accounts   | root    | ALL
(2 rows)
~~~

Finally, you grant `bob` privileges on the `user_accounts` view:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> GRANT SELECT ON user_accounts TO bob;
~~~

Now, `bob` will get a permissions error when trying to access the underlying `accounts` table but will be allowed to query the `user_accounts` view:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM accounts;
~~~

~~~
pq: user bob does not have SELECT privilege on table accounts
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM user_accounts;
~~~

~~~
    type   |      email
-----------+------------------
  checking | max@roach.com
  savings  | max@roach.com
  checking | betsy@roach.com
  checking | lilly@roach.com
  savings  | ben@roach.com
(5 rows)
~~~

## How views work

### Creating views

To create a view, use the [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.html) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE VIEW quotes_per_season (season, quotes)
  AS SELECT episodes.season, count(*)
  FROM quotes
  JOIN episodes
  ON quotes.episode = episodes.id
  GROUP BY episodes.season
  ORDER BY episodes.season;
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Any [selection query](selection-queries.html) is valid as operand to `CREATE VIEW`, not just [simple `SELECT` clauses](select-clause.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Listing views

Once created, views are listed alongside regular tables in the database:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW TABLES FROM startrek;
~~~

~~~
  schema_name |    table_name     | type  | estimated_row_count
--------------+-------------------+-------+----------------------
  public      | episodes          | table |                  79
  public      | quotes            | table |                 200
  public      | quotes_per_season | view  |                   0
(3 rows)
~~~

To list just views, you can query the `views` table in the [Information Schema](information-schema.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM information_schema.views;
~~~

~~~
  table_catalog | table_schema |    table_name     |                                                                               view_definition                                                                                | check_option | is_updatable | is_insertable_into | is_trigger_updatable | is_trigger_deletable | is_trigger_insertable_into
----------------+--------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------------
  startrek      | public       | quotes_per_season | SELECT episodes.season, count(*) FROM startrek.public.quotes JOIN startrek.public.episodes ON quotes.episode = episodes.id GROUP BY episodes.season ORDER BY episodes.season | NULL         | NO           | NO                 | NO                   | NO                   | NO
(1 row)
~~~

### Query a view

To query a view, target it with a [table expression](table-expressions.html#table-and-view-names), for example using a [`SELECT` clause](select-clause.html), just as you would with a stored table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM quotes_per_season;
~~~

~~~
  season | quotes
---------+---------
       1 |     78
       2 |     76
       3 |     46
(3 rows)
~~~

`SELECT`ing a view executes the view's stored `SELECT` statement, which returns the relevant data from the underlying table(s). To inspect the `SELECT` statement executed by the view, use the [`SHOW CREATE`](show-create.html) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW CREATE quotes_per_season;
~~~

~~~
     table_name     |                                                                                                           create_statement
--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  quotes_per_season | CREATE VIEW public.quotes_per_season (season, quotes) AS SELECT episodes.season, count(*) FROM startrek.public.quotes JOIN startrek.public.episodes ON quotes.episode = episodes.id GROUP BY episodes.season ORDER BY episodes.season
(1 row)
~~~

You can also inspect the `SELECT` statement executed by a view by querying the `views` table in the [Information Schema](information-schema.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT view_definition FROM information_schema.views WHERE table_name = 'quotes_per_season';
~~~

~~~
                                                                                view_definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SELECT episodes.season, count(*) FROM startrek.public.quotes JOIN startrek.public.episodes ON quotes.episode = episodes.id GROUP BY episodes.season ORDER BY episodes.season
(1 row)
~~~

### View dependencies

A view depends on the objects targeted by its underlying query. Attempting to [rename an object](alter-table.html#rename-to) referenced in a view's stored query therefore results in an error:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE quotes RENAME TO sayings;
~~~

~~~
ERROR: cannot rename relation "startrek.public.quotes" because view "quotes_per_season" depends on it
SQLSTATE: 2BP01
HINT: you can drop quotes_per_season instead.
~~~

Likewise, attempting to [drop an object](drop-table.html) referenced in a view's stored query results in an error:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> DROP TABLE quotes;
~~~

~~~
ERROR: cannot drop relation "quotes" because view "quotes_per_season" depends on it
SQLSTATE: 2BP01
HINT: you can drop quotes_per_season instead.
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE episodes DROP COLUMN season;
~~~

~~~
ERROR: cannot drop column "season" because view "quotes_per_season" depends on it
SQLSTATE: 2BP01
HINT: you can drop quotes_per_season instead.
~~~

 You can [drop](alter-table.html#drop-column) or [rename columns](alter-table.html#rename-column) from a table on which a view is dependent, as long as the view does not depend on that column of the table. For example, because there is no view that depends on the `num` column of the `episodes` table, you can rename it to `number`:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE startrek.episodes RENAME COLUMN num TO number;
~~~

Similarly, because no view depends on the `title` column of the `episodes` table, you can drop it. Note that to drop a column with data in it, you must first set `sql_safe_updates = false`.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SET sql_safe_updates = false;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE startrek.episodes DROP COLUMN title;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW COLUMNS FROM startrek.episodes;
~~~

~~~
  column_name | data_type | is_nullable | column_default | generation_expression |  indices  | is_hidden
--------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+-----------------------+-----------+------------
  id          | INT8      |    false    | NULL           |                       | {primary} |   false
  season      | INT8      |    true     | NULL           |                       | {primary} |   false
  number      | INT8      |    true     | NULL           |                       | {primary} |   false
  stardate    | DECIMAL   |    true     | NULL           |                       | {primary} |   false
(4 rows)
~~~

When [dropping a table](drop-table.html) or [dropping a view](drop-view.html), you can use the `CASCADE` keyword to drop all dependent objects as well:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> DROP TABLE quotes CASCADE;
~~~

~~~
DROP TABLE
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
`CASCADE` drops **all** dependent objects without listing them, which can lead to inadvertent and difficult-to-recover losses. To avoid potential harm, we recommend dropping objects individually in most cases.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Renaming views

To rename a view, use the [`ALTER VIEW`](alter-view.html) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER VIEW quotes_per_season RENAME TO quotes_count;
~~~

~~~
RENAME VIEW
~~~

It is not possible to change the stored query executed by the view. Instead, you must drop the existing view and create a new view.

### Replace a view

 To replace a view, use [`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`](create-view.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW quotes_count (season, quotes, stardate)
  AS SELECT episodes.season, count(*), episodes.stardate
  FROM quotes
  JOIN episodes
  ON quotes.episode = episodes.id
  GROUP BY episodes.season, episodes.stardate;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM quotes_count LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
  season | quotes | stardate
---------+--------+-----------
       1 |      5 |   1709.2
       1 |      7 |   2821.5
       1 |      2 |   3113.2
       1 |      6 |     3134
       1 |      3 |   2715.1
       1 |      7 |   3012.4
       1 |      2 |   3196.1
       2 |      4 |   3468.1
       2 |      1 |   3541.9
       2 |      5 |   4211.4
(10 rows)
~~~

### Remove a view

To remove a view, use the [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.html) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> DROP VIEW quotes_count;
~~~

~~~
DROP VIEW
~~~

## Materialized views

CockroachDB supports [materialized views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view). A _materialized view_ is a view that stores the results of its underlying query.

When you [select](selection-queries.html) from a materialized view, the stored query data that is returned might be out-of-date. This contrasts with a standard (i.e., "dematerialized") view, which runs its underlying query every time it is used, returning the latest results. In order to get the latest results from a materialized view, you must [refresh the view](refresh.html), and then select from it.

Because materialized views store query results, they offer better performance than standard views, at the expense of the additional storage required to store query results and the guarantee that the results are up-to-date.

### Usage

Materialized views and standard views share similar syntax for [creating](create-view.html), [showing](show-tables.html), [renaming](alter-view.html), and [dropping](drop-view.html).

To create a materialized view, use a [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`](create-view.html) statement.

For example, suppose that you have the [sample `bank` database](cockroach-workload.html#bank-workload) loaded to a CockroachDB cluster, and populated with some workload values:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW overdrawn_accounts
  AS SELECT id, balance
  FROM bank
  WHERE balance < 0;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM overdrawn_accounts;
~~~

~~~
  id  | balance
------+----------
    1 |  -17643
    3 |   -5928
   13 |   -3700
...
(402 rows)
~~~

To show existing materialized views, use a [`SHOW TABLES`](show-tables.html) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW TABLES;
~~~

~~~
  schema_name |     table_name     |       type        | estimated_row_count
--------------+--------------------+-------------------+----------------------
  public      | bank               | table             |                1000
  public      | overdrawn_accounts | materialized view |                   0
(2 rows)
~~~

Now suppose you update the `balance` values of the `bank` table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> UPDATE bank SET balance = 0 WHERE balance < 0;
~~~

~~~
UPDATE 402
~~~

The changes can be seen in the table with a simple `SELECT` statement against the table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT id, balance
FROM bank
WHERE balance < 0;
~~~

~~~
  id | balance
-----+----------
(0 rows)
~~~

Recall that materialized views do not automatically update their stored results. Selecting from `overdrawn_accounts` returns stored results, which are outdated:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM overdrawn_accounts;
~~~

~~~
  id  | balance
------+----------
    1 |  -17643
    3 |   -5928
   13 |   -3700
...
(402 rows)
~~~

To update the materialized view's results, use a [`REFRESH`](refresh.html) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW overdrawn_accounts;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM overdrawn_accounts;
~~~

~~~
  id | balance
-----+----------
(0 rows)
~~~

To rename the materialized view, use [`ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW`](alter-view.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW overdrawn_accounts RENAME TO forgiven_accounts;
~~~

~~~
RENAME VIEW
~~~

To remove the materialized view, use [`DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW`](drop-view.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW forgiven_accounts;
~~~

~~~
DROP VIEW
~~~

### Add an index to a materialized view

To speed up queries on materialized views, you can add an [index](schema-design-indexes.html) to the view.

1. Create a materialized view of the [MovR](movr.html) rides table where the revenue is less than $20.00:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW low_rev_rides AS SELECT city, vehicle_id, revenue from rides WHERE revenue < 20.00;
    ~~~

1. To see the plan for a select on this view, run:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    EXPLAIN SELECT vehicle_id, revenue FROM low_rev_rides WHERE city = 'seattle';
    ~~~

    ~~~
                                             info
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      distribution: full
      vectorized: true

      • filter
      │ filter: city = 'seattle'
      │
      └── • scan
            missing stats
            table: low_rev_rides@low_rev_rides_pkey
            spans: FULL SCAN

      index recommendations: 1
      1. type: index creation
         SQL command: CREATE INDEX ON low_rev_rides (city) STORING (vehicle_id, revenue);
    (14 rows)
    ~~~

    Notice that there are [no statistics](#known-limitations) collected on the view.

1. Create an index on the `city` column:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    CREATE INDEX ON low_rev_rides (city) STORING (vehicle_id, revenue);
    ~~~

1. To see the change in the plan after adding the index, run:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    EXPLAIN SELECT vehicle_id, revenue FROM low_rev_rides@low_rev_rides_city_idx WHERE city = 'seattle';
    ~~~

    ~~~
                          info
    -------------------------------------------------
      distribution: local
      vectorized: true

      • scan
        missing stats
        table: low_rev_rides@low_rev_rides_city_idx
        spans: [/'seattle' - /'seattle']
    (7 rows)
    ~~~

## Temporary views

CockroachDB supports session-scoped temporary views. Unlike persistent views, temporary views can only be accessed from the session in which they were created, and they are dropped at the end of the session. You can create temporary views on both persistent tables and [temporary tables](temporary-tables.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
**This is an experimental feature**. The interface and output are subject to change. For details, see the tracking issue [cockroachdb/cockroach#46260](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/46260).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Temporary tables must be enabled in order to use temporary views. By default, temporary tables are disabled in CockroachDB. To enable temporary tables, set the `experimental_enable_temp_tables` [session variable](set-vars.html) to `on`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Details

- Temporary views are automatically dropped at the end of the session.
- A temporary view can only be accessed from the session in which it was created.
- Temporary views persist across transactions in the same session.
- Temporary views cannot be converted to persistent views.
- Temporary views can be created on both persistent tables and [temporary tables](temporary-tables.html).
- When you create a view on a temporary table, the view automatically becomes temporary.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Like [temporary tables](temporary-tables.html), temporary views are not in the `public` schema. Instead, when you create the first temporary table, view, or sequence for a session, CockroachDB generates a single temporary schema (`pg_temp_<id>`) for all of the temporary objects in the current session for a database.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Usage

To create a temporary view, add [`TEMP`/`TEMPORARY`](sql-grammar.html#opt_temp) to a [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.html) statement.

For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TEMP VIEW temp_view (season, quotes)
  AS SELECT episodes.season, count(*)
  FROM quotes
  JOIN episodes
  ON quotes.episode = episodes.id
  GROUP BY episodes.season;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM temp_view;
~~~

~~~
  season | quotes
---------+---------
       1 |     78
       2 |     76
       3 |     46
(3 rows)
~~~
