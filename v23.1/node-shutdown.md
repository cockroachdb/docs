summary: How to drain, decommission, and gracefully shut down a node.

---

A node **shutdown** terminates the `cockroach` process on the node.

There are two ways to handle node shutdown:

- To temporarily stop a node and restart it later, **drain** the node and terminate the `cockroach` process. This is done when [upgrading the cluster version](upgrade-cockroach-version.html) or performing cluster maintenance (e.g., upgrading system software). With a drain, the data stored on the node is preserved, and will be reused if the node restarts within a reasonable timeframe. There is little node-to-node traffic involved, which makes a drain lightweight.

- To permanently remove the node from the cluster, **decommission** the node and then terminate the `cockroach` process. This is done when scaling down a cluster or reacting to hardware failures. With a decommission, the data is moved out of the node. Replica rebalancing creates network traffic throughout the cluster, which makes a decommission heavyweight.

This page describes:

- The details of the [node shutdown sequence](#node-shutdown-sequence) from the point of view of the `cockroach` process on a CockroachDB node.
- How to [prepare for graceful shutdown](#prepare-for-graceful-shutdown) on {{ site.data.products.core }} clusters by implementing connection retry logic and coordinating load balancer, client application server, process manager, and cluster settings.
- How to [perform node shutdown](#perform-node-shutdown) on {{ site.data.products.core }} deployments by manually draining or decommissioning a node.
- How to handle node shutdown when CockroachDB is deployed using [Kubernetes](#decommissioning-and-draining-on-kubernetes) or in a [{{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster](#decommissioning-and-draining-on-cockroachdb-dedicated).

When a node is permanently removed, the following stages occur in sequence:
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
#### Decommissioning

An operator [initiates the decommissioning process](#decommission-the-node) on the node.

The node's [`is_decommissioning`](cockroach-node.html#node-status) field is set to `true` and its `membership` status is set to `decommissioning`, which causes its replicas to be rebalanced to other nodes. If the rebalancing stalls during decommissioning, replicas that have yet to move are printed to the [SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html) and written to the [`OPS` logging channel](logging-overview.html#logging-channels). [By default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration), the `OPS` channel logs output to a `cockroach.log` file.

The node's [`/health?ready=1` endpoint](monitoring-and-alerting.html#health-ready-1) continues to consider the node "ready" so that the node can function as a gateway to route SQL client connections to relevant data.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
After this stage, the node is automatically drained. However, to avoid possible disruptions in query performance, we recommend manually draining before decommissioning. For more information, see [Perform node shutdown](#perform-node-shutdown).

</section>

#### Draining

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="drain">
An operator [initiates the draining process](#drain-the-node-and-terminate-the-node-process) on the node. Draining a node disconnects clients after active queries are completed, and transfers any range leases and Raft leaderships to other nodes, but does not move replicas or data off of the node.
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
After all replicas on a decommissioning node are rebalanced, the node is automatically drained.
</section>

Node drain consists of the following consecutive phases:

1. **Unready phase:** The node's [`/health?ready=1` endpoint](monitoring-and-alerting.html#health-ready-1) returns an HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` response code, which causes load balancers and connection managers to reroute traffic to other nodes. This phase completes when the [fixed duration set by `server.shutdown.drain_wait`](#server-shutdown-drain_wait) is reached.

1. **SQL wait phase:** New SQL client connections are no longer permitted, and any remaining SQL client connections are allowed to close or time out. This phase completes either when all SQL client connections are closed or the [maximum duration set by `server.shutdown.connection_wait`](#server-shutdown-connection_wait) is reached.

1. **SQL drain phase:** All active transactions and statements for which the node is a [gateway](architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html#gateway) are allowed to complete, and CockroachDB closes the SQL client connections immediately afterward. After this phase completes, CockroachDB closes all remaining SQL client connections to the node. This phase completes either when all transactions have been processed or the [maximum duration set by `server.shutdown.query_wait`](#server-shutdown-query_wait) is reached.

1. **DistSQL drain phase**: All [distributed statements](architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql) initiated on other gateway nodes are allowed to complete, and DistSQL requests from other nodes are no longer accepted. This phase completes either when all transactions have been processed or the [maximum duration set by `server.shutdown.query_wait`](#server-shutdown-query_wait) is reached.

1. **Lease transfer phase:** The node's [`is_draining`](cockroach-node.html#node-status) field is set to `true`, which removes the node as a candidate for replica rebalancing, lease transfers, and query planning. Any [range leases](architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) or [Raft leaderships](architecture/replication-layer.html#raft) must be transferred to other nodes. This phase completes when all range leases and Raft leaderships have been transferred.

    <section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
    Since all range replicas were already removed from the node during the [decommissioning](#decommissioning) stage, this step immediately resolves.
    </section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="drain">
When [draining manually](#drain-a-node-manually), if the above steps have not completed after 10 minutes by default, node draining will stop and must be restarted to continue. For more information, see [Drain timeout](#drain-timeout).
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
#### Status change

After decommissioning and draining are both complete, the node membership changes from `decommissioning` to `decommissioned`.

This node is now cut off from communicating with the rest of the cluster. A client attempting to connect to a `decommissioned` node and run a query will get an error.
</section>

At this point, the `cockroach` process is still running. It is only stopped by process termination.

#### Process termination

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
An operator [terminates the node process](#terminate-the-node-process).
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="drain">
After draining completes, the node process is automatically terminated (unless the [node was manually drained](#drain-a-node-manually)).
</section>

A node **process termination** stops the `cockroach` process on the node. The node will stop updating its liveness record.

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="drain">
If the node then stays offline for the duration set by [`server.time_until_store_dead`](#server-time_until_store_dead) (5 minutes by default), the cluster considers the node "dead" and starts to rebalance its range replicas onto other nodes.

If the node is brought back online, its remaining range replicas will determine whether or not they are still valid members of replica groups. If a range replica is still valid and any data in its range has changed, it will receive updates from another replica in the group. If a range replica is no longer valid, it will be removed from the node.
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
A node that stays offline for the duration set by the `server.time_until_store_dead` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) (5 minutes by default) is usually considered "dead" by the cluster. However, a decommissioned node retains **decommissioned** status.
</section>

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
CockroachDB's node shutdown behavior does not match any of the [PostgreSQL server shutdown modes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-shutdown.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Prepare for graceful shutdown

Each of the [node shutdown steps](#node-shutdown-sequence) is performed in order, with each step commencing once the previous step has completed. However, because some steps can be interrupted, it's best to ensure that all steps complete gracefully.

Before you [perform node shutdown](#perform-node-shutdown), review the following prerequisites to graceful shutdown:

<ul>
<li>Configure your <a href="#load-balancing">load balancer</a> to monitor node health.</li>
<li>Review and adjust <a href="#cluster-settings">cluster settings</a> and <a href="#drain-timeout">drain timeout</a> as needed for your deployment.</li>
<li>Implement <a href="#connection-retry-loop">connection retry logic</a> to handle closed connections.</li>
<li>Configure the <a href="#termination-grace-period">termination grace period</a> of your process manager or orchestration system.</li>
<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
<li>Ensure that the <a href="#size-and-replication-factor">size and replication factor</a> of your cluster are sufficient to handle decommissioning.</li>
</section>
</ul>

### Load balancing

Your [load balancer](recommended-production-settings.html#load-balancing) should use the [`/health?ready=1` endpoint](monitoring-and-alerting.html#health-ready-1) to actively monitor node health and direct SQL client connections away from draining nodes.

To handle node shutdown effectively, the load balancer must be given enough time by the [`server.shutdown.drain_wait` duration](#server-shutdown-drain_wait).

### Cluster settings

#### `server.shutdown.drain_wait`

`server.shutdown.drain_wait` sets a **fixed** duration for the ["unready phase"](#draining) of node drain. Because a load balancer reroutes connections to non-draining nodes within this duration (`0s` by default), this setting should be coordinated with the load balancer settings.

Increase `server.shutdown.drain_wait` so that your load balancer is able to make adjustments before this phase times out. Because the drain process waits unconditionally for the `server.shutdown.drain_wait` duration, do not set this value too high.

For example, [HAProxy](cockroach-gen.html#generate-an-haproxy-config-file) uses the default settings `inter 2000 fall 3` when checking server health. This means that HAProxy considers a node to be down (and temporarily removes the server from the pool) after 3 unsuccessful health checks being run at intervals of 2000 milliseconds. To ensure HAProxy can run 3 consecutive checks before timeout, set `server.shutdown.drain_wait` to `8s` or greater:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING server.shutdown.drain_wait = '8s';
~~~

#### `server.shutdown.connection_wait`

`server.shutdown.connection_wait` sets the **maximum** duration for the ["connection phase"](#draining) of node drain. SQL client connections are allowed to close or time out within this duration (`0s` by default). This setting presents an option to gracefully close the connections before CockroachDB forcibly closes those that remain after the ["SQL drain phase"](#draining).

Change this setting **only** if you cannot tolerate connection errors during node drain and will not implement a [connection retry loop](#connection-retry-loop) for your application. We suggest setting `server.shutdown.connection_wait` in accordance with the maximum lifetime of a SQL client connection, which is usually configurable via a [connection pool](connection-pooling.html#about-connection-pools). Depending on your requirements:

- Lower the maximum lifetime of a SQL client connection in the pool. This will cause more frequent reconnections. Set `server.shutdown.connection_wait` above this value.
- If you cannot tolerate more frequent reconnections, do not change the SQL client connection lifetime. Instead, use a longer `server.shutdown.connection_wait`. This will cause a longer draining process.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If you do not change `server.shutdown.connection_wait`, you should use a [connection retry loop](#connection-retry-loop) to handle connection errors during node drain.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### `server.shutdown.query_wait`

`server.shutdown.query_wait` sets the **maximum** duration for the ["SQL drain phase"](#draining) and the **maximum** duration for the ["DistSQL drain phase"](#draining) of node drain. Active local and distributed queries must complete, in turn, within this duration (`10s` by default).

Ensure that `server.shutdown.query_wait` is greater than:

- The longest possible transaction in the workload that is expected to complete successfully.
- The `sql.defaults.idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` cluster setting, which controls the duration a session is permitted to idle in a transaction before the session is terminated (`0s` by default).
- The `sql.defaults.statement_timeout` cluster setting, which controls the duration a query is permitted to run before it is canceled (`0s` by default).

`server.shutdown.query_wait` defines the upper bound of the duration, meaning that node drain proceeds to the next phase as soon as the last open transaction completes.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If there are still open transactions on the draining node when the server closes its connections, you will encounter errors. Your application should handle these errors with a [connection retry loop](#connection-retry-loop).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include {{page.version.version}}/sql/sql-defaults-cluster-settings-deprecation-notice.md %}

#### `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`

In the ["lease transfer phase"](#draining) of node drain, the server attempts to transfer all range leases and Raft leaderships from the draining node. `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait` sets the maximum duration of each iteration of this attempt (`5s` by default). Because this phase does not exit until all transfers are completed, changing this value only affects the frequency at which drain progress messages are printed.

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="drain">
In most cases, the default value is suitable. Do **not** set `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait` to a value lower than `5s`. In this case, leases can fail to transfer and node drain will not be able to complete.
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
Since [decommissioning](#decommissioning) a node rebalances all of its range replicas onto other nodes, no replicas will remain on the node by the time draining begins. Therefore, no iterations occur during this phase. This setting can be left alone.
</section>

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The sum of [`server.shutdown.drain_wait`](#server-shutdown-drain_wait), [`server.shutdown.connection_wait`](#server-shutdown-connection_wait), [`server.shutdown.query_wait`](#server-shutdown-query_wait) times two, and [`server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`](#server-shutdown-lease_transfer_wait) should not be greater than the configured [drain timeout](#drain-timeout).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### `kv.allocator.recovery_store_selector`

When a node is dead or decommissioning and all of its range replicas are being up-replicated onto other nodes, this setting controls the algorithm used to select the new node for each range replica. Regardless of the algorithm, a node must satisfy all available constraints for replica placement and survivability to be eligible.

Possible values are `good` (the default) and `best`. When set to `good`, a random node is selected from the list of all eligible nodes. When set to `best`, a node with a low range count is preferred.

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="drain">

#### `server.time_until_store_dead`

`server.time_until_store_dead` sets the duration after which a node is considered "dead" and its data is rebalanced to other nodes (`5m0s` by default). In the node shutdown sequence, this follows [process termination](#node-shutdown-sequence).

Before temporarily stopping nodes for planned maintenance (e.g., upgrading system software), if you expect any nodes to be offline for longer than 5 minutes, you can prevent the cluster from unnecessarily moving data off the nodes by increasing `server.time_until_store_dead` to match the estimated maintenance window:

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
During this window, the cluster has reduced ability to tolerate another node failure. Be aware that increasing this value therefore reduces fault tolerance.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING server.time_until_store_dead = '15m0s';
~~~

After completing the maintenance work and [restarting the nodes](cockroach-start.html), you would then change the setting back to its default:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESET CLUSTER SETTING server.time_until_store_dead;
~~~
</section>

### Drain timeout

When [draining manually](#drain-a-node-manually) with `cockroach node drain`, all [drain phases](#draining) must be completed within the duration of `--drain-wait` (`10m` by default) or the drain will stop. This can be observed with an `ERROR: drain timeout` message in the terminal output. To continue the drain, re-initiate the command.

A very long drain may indicate an anomaly, and you should manually inspect the server to determine what blocks the drain.

CockroachDB automatically increases the verbosity of logging when it detects a stall in the range lease transfer stage of `node drain`. Messages logged during such a stall include the time an attempt occurred, the total duration stalled waiting for the transfer attempt to complete, and the lease that is being transferred.

`--drain-wait` sets the timeout for [all draining phases](#draining) and is **not** related to the `server.shutdown.drain_wait` cluster setting, which configures the "unready phase" of draining. The value of `--drain-wait` should be greater than the sum of [`server.shutdown.drain_wait`](#server-shutdown-drain_wait), [`server.shutdown.connection_wait`](#server-shutdown-connection_wait), [`server.shutdown.query_wait`](#server-shutdown-query_wait) times two, and [`server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`](#server-shutdown-lease_transfer_wait).

### Connection retry loop

At the end of the ["SQL drain phase"](#draining) of node drain, the server forcibly closes all SQL client connections to the node. If any open transactions were interrupted or not admitted by the server because of the connection closure, they will fail with either a generic TCP-level client error or one of the following errors:

- `57P01 server is shutting down` indicates that the server is not accepting new transactions on existing connections.
- `08006 An I/O error occurred while sending to the backend` indicates that the current connection was broken (closed by the server).

These errors are an expected occurrence during node shutdown. To be resilient to such errors, **your application should use a reconnection and retry loop** to reissue transactions that were open when a connection was closed or the server stopped accepting transactions. This allows procedures such as [rolling upgrades](upgrade-cockroach-version.html) to complete without interrupting your service.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If you cannot tolerate connection errors during node drain, then instead of using a connection retry loop, [configure `server.shutdown.connection_wait`](#server-shutdown-connection_wait) to allow SQL client connections to close gracefully. This will require making additional trade-offs.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Upon receiving a connection error, your application must handle the result of a previously open transaction as unknown.

A connection retry loop should:

1. Close the current connection.
1. Open a new connection. This will be routed to a non-draining node.
1. Reissue the transaction on the new connection.
1. Repeat while the connection error persists and the retry count has not exceeded a configured maximum.

### Termination grace period

On production deployments, a process manager or orchestration system can disrupt graceful node shutdown if its termination grace period is too short.

If the `cockroach` process has not terminated at the end of the grace period, a `SIGKILL` signal is sent to perform a "hard" shutdown that bypasses CockroachDB's [node shutdown logic](#node-shutdown-sequence) and forcibly terminates the process. This can corrupt log files and, in certain edge cases, can result in temporary data unavailability, latency spikes, uncertainty errors, ambiguous commit errors, or query timeouts. When decommissioning, a hard shutdown will leave ranges under-replicated and vulnerable to another node failure until up-replication completes, which could cause loss of [quorum](architecture/replication-layer.html#overview).

- When using [`systemd`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) to run CockroachDB as a service, set the termination grace period with [`TimeoutStopSec`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#TimeoutStopSec=) setting in the service file.

- When using [Kubernetes](kubernetes-overview.html) to orchestrate CockroachDB, refer to [Decommissioning and draining on Kubernetes](#decommissioning-and-draining-on-kubernetes).

To determine an appropriate termination grace period:

- [Run `cockroach node drain` with `--drain-wait`](#drain-a-node-manually) and observe the amount of time it takes node drain to successfully complete.

- In general, we recommend setting the termination grace period **between 5 and 10 minutes**. If a node requires more than 10 minutes to drain successfully, this may indicate a technical issue such as inadequate [cluster sizing](recommended-production-settings.html#sizing).

- Increasing the termination grace period does not increase the duration of a node shutdown. However, the termination grace period should not be excessively long, in case an underlying hardware or software issue causes node shutdown to become "stuck".

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">

### Size and replication factor

Before decommissioning a node, make sure other nodes are available to take over the range replicas from the node. If fewer nodes are available than the replication factor, CockroachDB will automatically reduce the replication factor (for example, from 5 to 3) to try to allow the decommission to succeed. However, the replication factor will not be reduced lower than 3. If three nodes are not available, the decommissioning process will hang indefinitely until nodes are added or you update the zone configurations to use a replication factor of 1.

#### 3-node cluster with 3-way replication

In this scenario, each range is replicated 3 times, with each replica on a different node:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'images/v23.1/decommission-scenario1.1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Decommission Scenario 1" style="max-width:50%" /></div>

If you try to decommission a node, the process will hang indefinitely because the cluster cannot move the decommissioning node's replicas to the other 2 nodes, which already have a replica of each range:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'images/v23.1/decommission-scenario1.2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Decommission Scenario 1" style="max-width:50%" /></div>

To successfully decommission a node in this cluster, you need to **add a 4th node**. The decommissioning process can then complete:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'images/v23.1/decommission-scenario1.3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Decommission Scenario 1" style="max-width:50%" /></div>

#### 5-node cluster with 3-way replication

In this scenario, like in the scenario above, each range is replicated 3 times, with each replica on a different node:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'images/v23.1/decommission-scenario2.1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Decommission Scenario 1" style="max-width:50%" /></div>

If you decommission a node, the process will run successfully because the cluster will be able to move the node's replicas to other nodes without doubling up any range replicas:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ 'images/v23.1/decommission-scenario2.2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Decommission Scenario 1" style="max-width:50%" /></div>

## Perform node shutdown

</section>

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
This guidance applies to manual deployments. In a Kubernetes deployment or a {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster, terminating the `cockroach` process is handled through Kubernetes. Refer to [Decommissioning and draining on Kubernetes](#decommissioning-and-draining-on-kubernetes) and [Decommissioning and draining on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}](#decommissioning-and-draining-on-cockroachdb-dedicated).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
### Drain the node

Although [draining automatically follows decommissioning](#draining), we recommend first running [`cockroach node drain`](cockroach-node.html) to manually drain the node of active queries, SQL client connections, and leases before decommissioning. This is optional, but prevents possible disruptions in query performance. For specific instructions, see the [example](#drain-a-node-manually).

### Decommission the node

Run [`cockroach node decommission`](cockroach-node.html) to decommission the node and rebalance its range replicas. For specific instructions and additional guidelines, see the [example](#remove-nodes).

If the rebalancing stalls during decommissioning, replicas that have yet to move are printed to the [SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html) and written to the [`OPS` logging channel](logging-overview.html#logging-channels) with the message `possible decommission stall detected`. [By default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration), the `OPS` channel logs output to a `cockroach.log` file.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Do **not** terminate the node process, delete the storage volume, or remove the VM before a `decommissioning` node has [changed its membership status](#status-change) to `decommissioned`. Prematurely terminating the process will prevent the node from rebalancing all of its range replicas onto other nodes gracefully, cause transient query errors in client applications, and leave the remaining ranges under-replicated and vulnerable to loss of [quorum](architecture/replication-layer.html#overview) if another node goes down.

### `OPS`

During node shutdown, progress messages are generated in the [`OPS` logging channel](logging-overview.html#logging-channels). The frequency of these messages is configured with [`server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`](#server-shutdown-lease_transfer_wait). [By default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration), the `OPS` logs output to a `cockroach.log` file.

### Drain a node manually

You can use [`cockroach node drain`](cockroach-node.html) to drain a node separately from decommissioning the node or terminating the node process.

1. Run the `cockroach node drain` command, specifying the ID of the node to drain (and optionally a custom [drain timeout](#drain-timeout) to allow draining more time to complete):

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach node drain 1 --host={address of any live node} --drain-wait=15m --certs-dir=certs
    ~~~

    You will see the draining status print to `stderr`:

    ~~~
    node is draining... remaining: 50
    node is draining... remaining: 0 (complete)
    ok
    ~~~

1. Filter the logs for shutdown progress messages. [By default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration), the `OPS` logs output to a `cockroach.log` file:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    grep 'drain' node1/logs/cockroach.log

    ~~~

    The `drain request completed without server shutdown` message indicates that the node was drained.

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="decommission">
### Remove nodes

In addition to the [graceful node shutdown](#prepare-for-graceful-shutdown) requirements, observe the following guidelines:

- Before decommissioning nodes, verify that there are no [under-replicated or unavailable ranges](ui-cluster-overview-page.html#cluster-overview-panel) on the cluster.
- Do **not** terminate the node process, delete the storage volume, or remove the VM before a `decommissioning` node has [changed its membership status](#status-change) to `decommissioned`. Prematurely terminating the process will prevent the node from rebalancing all of its range replicas onto other nodes gracefully, cause transient query errors in client applications, and leave the remaining ranges under-replicated and vulnerable to loss of [quorum](architecture/replication-layer.html#overview) if another node goes down.
- When removing nodes, decommission all nodes at once. Do not decommission the nodes one-by-one. This will incur unnecessary data movement costs due to replicas being passed between decommissioning nodes. **All** nodes must be fully `decommissioned` before terminating the node process and removing the data storage.
- If you have a decommissioning node that appears to be hung, you can [recommission](#recommission-nodes) the node.

#### Step 1. Get the IDs of the nodes to decommission

Open the **Cluster Overview** page of the DB Console and [note the node IDs](ui-cluster-overview-page.html#node-details) of the nodes you want to decommission.

This example assumes you will decommission node IDs `4` and `5` of a 5-node cluster.

#### Step 2. Drain the nodes manually

Run the [`cockroach node drain`](cockroach-node.html) command for each node to be removed, specifying the ID of the node to drain:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cockroach node drain 4 --host={address of any live node} --certs-dir=certs
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cockroach node drain 5 --host={address of any live node} --certs-dir=certs
~~~

You will see the draining status of each node print to `stderr`:

~~~
node is draining... remaining: 50
node is draining... remaining: 0 (complete)
ok
~~~

Manually draining before decommissioning nodes is optional, but prevents possible disruptions in query performance.

#### Step 3. Decommission the nodes

Run the [`cockroach node decommission`](cockroach-node.html) command with the IDs of the nodes to decommission:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach node decommission 4 5 --certs-dir=certs --host={address of any live node}
~~~

You'll then see the decommissioning status print to `stderr` as it changes:

~~~
  id | is_live | replicas | is_decommissioning |   membership    | is_draining
-----+---------+----------+--------------------+-----------------+--------------
   4 |  true   |       39 |        true        | decommissioning |    true
   5 |  true   |       34 |        true        | decommissioning |    true
(2 rows)
~~~

The `is_draining` field is `true` because the nodes were previously drained.

Once the nodes have been fully decommissioned, you'll see zero `replicas` and a confirmation:

~~~
  id | is_live | replicas | is_decommissioning |   membership    | is_draining
-----+---------+----------+--------------------+-----------------+--------------
   4 |  true   |        0 |        true        | decommissioning |    true
   5 |  true   |        0 |        true        | decommissioning |    true
(2 rows)

No more data reported on target nodes. Please verify cluster health before removing the nodes.
~~~

The `is_decommissioning` field remains `true` after all replicas have been removed from each node.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Do **not** terminate the node process, delete the storage volume, or remove the VM before a `decommissioning` node has [changed its membership status](#status-change) to `decommissioned`. Prematurely terminating the process will prevent the node from rebalancing all of its range replicas onto other nodes gracefully, cause transient query errors in client applications, and leave the remaining ranges under-replicated and vulnerable to loss of [quorum](architecture/replication-layer.html#overview) if another node goes down.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Step 4. Confirm the nodes are decommissioned

Check the status of the decommissioned nodes:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach node status --decommission --certs-dir=certs --host={address of any live node}
~~~

~~~

(5 rows)
~~~

- Membership on the decommissioned nodes should have changed from `decommissioning` to `decommissioned`.
- `0` replicas should remain on these nodes.

Once the nodes complete decommissioning, they will appear in the list of [**Recently Decommissioned Nodes**](ui-cluster-overview-page.html#decommissioned-nodes) in the DB Console.

#### Step 5. Terminate the process on decommissioned nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/process-termination.md %}

The following messages will be printed:

~~~

server drained and shutdown completed
~~~

### Remove a dead node

If a node is offline for the duration set by `server.time_until_store_dead` (5 minutes by default), the cluster considers the node "dead" and starts to rebalance its range replicas onto other nodes.

However, if the dead node is restarted, the cluster will rebalance replicas and leases onto the node. To prevent the cluster from rebalancing data to a dead node that comes back online, do the following:

#### Step 1. Confirm the node is dead

Check the status of your nodes:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach node status --decommission --certs-dir=certs --host={address of any live node}

The `is_live` field of the dead node will be `false`.

Alternatively, open the **Cluster Overview** page of the DB Console and check that the [node status](ui-cluster-overview-page.html#node-status) of the node is `DEAD`.

#### Step 2. Decommission the dead node

Run the [`cockroach node decommission`](cockroach-node.html) command against the address of any live node, specifying the ID of the dead node:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach node decommission 1 --certs-dir=certs --host={address of any live node}
~~~

~~~
  id | is_live | replicas | is_decommissioning |   membership    | is_draining
-----+---------+----------+--------------------+-----------------+--------------
   1 |  false  |        0 |        true        | decommissioning |    true
(1 row)

No more data reported on target nodes. Please verify cluster health before removing the nodes.
~~~

#### Step 3. Confirm the node is decommissioned

Check the status of the decommissioned node:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach node status --decommission --certs-dir=certs --host={address of any live node}
~~~

~~~
  id |     address     |   sql_address   |      build      |         started_at         |         updated_at         | locality | is_available | is_live | gossiped_replicas | is_decommissioning |   membership   | is_draining

- Membership on the decommissioned node should have changed from `active` to `decommissioned`.

Once the node completes decommissioning, it will appear in the list of [**Recently Decommissioned Nodes**](ui-cluster-overview-page.html#decommissioned-nodes) in the DB Console.

### Recommission nodes

If you accidentally started decommissioning a node, or have a node with a hung decommissioning process, you can recommission the node. This cancels replica removal from the decommissioning node.

Recommissioning can only cancel an active decommissioning process. If a node has [completed decommissioning](#status-change), you must start a new node. A fully decommissioned node is permanently decommissioned, and cannot be recommissioned.

#### Step 1. Cancel the decommissioning process

Press `ctrl-c` in each terminal with an ongoing decommissioning process that you want to cancel.

#### Step 2. Recommission the decommissioning nodes

Run the [`cockroach node recommission`](cockroach-node.html) command with the ID of the node to recommission:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach node recommission 1 --certs-dir=certs --host={address of any live node}
~~~

The value of `is_decommissioning` will change back to `false`:

~~~
  id | is_live | replicas | is_decommissioning | membership | is_draining
-----+---------+----------+--------------------+------------+--------------
   1 |  false  |       73 |       false        |   active   |    true
(1 row)
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If the decommissioning node has already reached the [draining stage](#draining), you may need to restart the node after it is recommissioned.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

On the **Cluster Overview** page of the DB Console, the [node status](ui-cluster-overview-page.html#node-status) of the node should be `LIVE`. After a few minutes, you should see replicas rebalanced to the nodes.

## Decommissioning and draining on Kubernetes

Most of the guidance in this page is most relevant to manual deployments that don't use Kubernetes. If you use Kubernetes to deploy CockroachDB, draining and decommissioning work the same way for the `cockroach` process, but Kubernetes handles them on your behalf. In a deployment without Kubernetes, an administrator initiates decommissioning or draining directly. In a Kubernetes deployment, an administrator modifies the desired configuration of the Kubernetes cluster and Kubernetes makes the required changes to the cluster, including decommissioning or draining nodes as required.

- Whether you deployed a cluster using the CockroachDB Operator, Helm, or a manual StatefulSet, the resulting deployment is a StatefulSet. Due to the nature of StatefulSets, it's safe to decommission **only** the Cockroach node with the highest StatefulSet ordinal in preparation for scaling down the StatefulSet. If you think you need to decommission any other node, consider the following recommendations and [contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/hc/en-us) for assistance.

    - If you deployed a cluster using the [CockroachDB Kubernetes Operator](deploy-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html), the best way to scale down a cluster is to update the specification for the Kubernetes deployment to reduce the value of `nodes:` and apply the change using a [rolling update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/). Kubernetes will notice that there are now too many nodes and will reduce them and clean up their storage automatically.

    - If you deployed the cluster using [Helm](deploy-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html?filters=helm) or a [manual StatefulSet](deploy-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html?filters=manual), the best way to scale down a cluster is to interactively decommission and drain the highest-order node. After that node is decommissioned, drained, and terminated, you can repeat the process to further reduce the cluster's size.

    Refer to [Cluster Scaling](scale-cockroachdb-kubernetes.html).

- There is generally no need to interactively drain a node that is not being decommissioned, regardless of how you deployed the cluster in Kubernetes. When you upgrade, downgrade, or change the configuration of a CockroachDB deployment on Kubernetes, you apply the changes using a [rolling update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/), which applies the change to one node at a time. On a given node, Kubernetes sends a `SIGTERM` signal to the `cockroach` process. When the `cockroach` process receives this signal, it starts draining itself. After draining is complete or the [termination grace period](#termination-grace-period-on-kubernetes) expires (whichever happens first), Kubernetes terminates the `cockroach` process and then removes the node from the Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes then applies the updated deployment to the cluster node, restarts the `cockroach` process, and re-joins the cluster. Refer to [Cluster Upgrades](upgrade-cockroachdb-kubernetes.html).

- Although the `kubectl drain` command is used for manual maintenance of Kubernetes clusters, it has little direct relevance to the concept of draining a node in a CockroachDB cluster. The `kubectl drain` command gracefully terminates each pod running on a Kubernetes node so that the node can be shut down (in the case of physical hardware) or deleted (in the case of a virtual machine). For details on this command, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/).

Refer to [Termination grace period on Kubernetes](#termination-grace-period-on-kubernetes). For more details about managing CockroachDB on Kubernetes, refer to [Cluster upgrades](upgrade-cockroachdb-kubernetes.html) and [Cluster scaling](scale-cockroachdb-kubernetes.html).

### Termination grace period on Kubernetes

After Kubernetes issues a termination request to the `cockroach` process on a cluster node, it waits for a maximum of the deployment's [`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination) before forcibly terminating the process. If `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is too short, the `cockroach` process may be terminated before it can shut down cleanly and client applications may be disrupted.

If undefined, Kubernetes sets `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to 30 seconds. This is too short for the `cockroach` process to stop gracefully before Kubernetes terminates it forcibly. Do not set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to `0`, which prevents Kubernetes from detecting and terminating a stuck pod.

For clusters deployed using the CockroachDB Public Operator, `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
For clusters deployed using the CockroachDB Helm chart or a manual StatefulSet, the default depends upon the values file or manifest you used when you created the cluster.

Cockroach Labs recommends that you:

- Set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to no shorter than 300 seconds (5 minutes). This recommendation has been validated over time for many production workloads. In most cases, a value higher than 600 seconds (10 minutes) is not required. If CockroachDB takes longer than 10 minutes to gracefully stop, this may indicate an underlying configuration problem. Test the value you select against representative workloads before rolling out the change to production clusters.
- Set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to be at least 5 seconds longer than the configured [drain timeout](#server-shutdown-drain_wait), to allow the node to complete draining before Kubernetes removes the Kubernetes pod for the CockroachDB node.
- Ensure that the **sum** of the following `server.shutdown.*` settings for the CockroachDB cluster do not exceed the deployment's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, to reduce the likelihood that a node must be terminated forcibly.

  - [`server.shutdown.drain_wait`](#server-shutdown-drain_wait)
  - [`server.shutdown.connection_wait`](#server-shutdown-connection_wait)
  - [`server.shutdown.query_wait`](#server-shutdown-query_wait) times two
  - [`server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`](#server-shutdown-lease_transfer_wait)

    For more information about these settings, refer to [Cluster settings](#cluster-settings). Refer also to the [Kubernetes documentation about pod termination](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination).

- Client applications that connect to CockroachDB must handle disconnections gracefully, because from the point of view of the client, cluster maintenance is always a possibility.

  - A client application's connection pool should have a maximum lifetime that is shorter than the Kubernetes deployment's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` setting. Cockroach Labs recommends aligning the value for [server.shutdown.connection_wait](#server-shutdown-connection_wait) with the connection pool's maximum lifetime.
  - If a client application is connected to a cluster node that is draining, it will be disconnected, and must include the ability to try to connect again. Refer to [Connection retry loop](#connection-retry-loop).

## Decommissioning and draining on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}

Most of the guidance in this page is most relevant to manual deployments, although decommissioning and draining work the same way behind the scenes in a {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster. {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters have a termination grace period of 300 seconds (5 minutes). This setting is not configurable.
