You can use external connections to specify and interact with resources that are external from CockroachDB. When creating an external connection, you define a name for an external connection while passing the provider URI and query parameters. The `DROP EXTERNAL CONNECTION` statement allows you to delete external connections.

You can also use the following SQL statements to work with external connections:

- [`CREATE EXTERNAL CONNECTION`](create-external-connection.html)
- [`SHOW CREATE EXTERNAL CONNECTION`](show-create-external-connection.html)

## Required privileges

Users must have the [`DROP` privilege](security-reference/authorization.html#supported-privileges) or be a member of the [`admin` role](security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role) to drop an external connection.
