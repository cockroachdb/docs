CockroachDB's Admin UI provides detail about your cluster's performance and health.

You can access the CockroachDB Admin UI from any node in a cluster on port `8080` via HTTP (e.g., `http://<node IP address>:8080`).

For additional guidance on accessing the Admin UI, see [Start a Local Cluster](start-a-local-cluster.html) and [Manual Deployment](manual-deployment.html).

*Additional docs coming soon.*
