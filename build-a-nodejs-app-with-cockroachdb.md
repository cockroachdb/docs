title: Build a Node.js App with CockroachDB
summary: Learn how to use CockroachDB from a simple Node.js application with a low-level client driver.

This tutorial shows you how build a simple Node.js application with CockroachDB using a PostgreSQL-compatible driver. We've tested and can recommend the [Node.js pg driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg), so that driver is featured here.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have already [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).

## Step 1. Install Node.js packages

To let your application communicate with CockroachDB, install the [Node.js pg driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg):

~~~ shell
$ npm install pg
~~~

The example app on this page also requires [`async`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async):

~~~ shell
$ npm install async
~~~


{% include app/common-steps.md %}

## Step 5. Run the Node.js code

### Basic Statements

The following code connects as the `maxroach` user and executes some basic SQL statements, creating a table, inserting rows, and reading and printing the rows. 

Copy the code or 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/gh-pages/_includes/app/basic-sample.js" download>download it directly</a>.

~~~ js
{% include app/basic-sample.js %}
~~~

### Transaction (with retry logic)

The following code again connects as the `maxroach` user but this time executes a batch of statements as an atomic transaction to transfer funds from one account to another, where all included statements are either committed or aborted. 

Copy the code or 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/gh-pages/_includes/app/txn-sample.js" download>download it directly</a>. 

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}Because the CockroachDB transaction model requires the client to initiate retries in the case of contention, CockroachDB provides a generic <strong>retry function</strong> that runs inside a transaction and retries it as needed. You can copy and paste the retry function from here into your code. For more details, see <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/transactions.html#transaction-retries">Transaction Retries</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

~~~ js
{% include app/txn-sample.js %}
~~~

After running the code, to verify that funds were, in fact, transferred from one account to another, you can again use the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html): 

~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql -e 'SELECT id, balance FROM accounts' --database=bank
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |     900 |
|  2 |     350 |
+----+---------+
(2 rows)
~~~
