## Description

If a cluster is  upgraded directly from v22.1.x directly to v22.2.4 and has not been finalized, or if a previous upgrade to v22.2.x was not finalized and the cluster is then upgraded to v22.2.4, non-admin users are unable to connect to the cluster until the upgrade is either finalized or rolled back.

This issue affects only v22.2.4 clusters.


## Statement

Cockroach Labs has withdrawn v22.2.4, and it can no longer be downloaded.

The issue is resolved in CockroachDB v22.2.5 by PR [#97183](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/97183).

This public issue is tracked by [#97178](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/97178).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB 22.2.4 that experience this issue should either [finalize the upgrade](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/upgrade-cockroach-version.html#step-5-finish-the-upgrade) or roll back to the version that they were using before the upgrade.

To roll back to a previous version, self-hosted customers should replace the binary on each node with the binary for the previous version, then restart the node. Cockroach Cloud customers should refer to [Roll back the upgrade](/docs/cockroachcloud/upgrade-to-v22.2.html#roll-back-the-upgrade).

Instead of upgrading from a release older than v22.2 directly to v22.2.4, users can upgrade the cluster to any other v22.2.x version, including:

- v22.2.0
- v22.2.1
- v22.2.2
- v22.2.3
- v22.2.5

After upgrading, finalize the upgrade.

## Impact

Non-admin users are unable to connect to a cluster that is upgraded to v22.2.4 when a previous major version upgrade to v22.2.x was not finalized.
