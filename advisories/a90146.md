## Description

In CockroachDB [v22.1.6](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-6) to [v22.1.9](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-9), changefeeds using the [`initial_scan='only'`](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html#initial-scan) option can complete with a `successful` status even if not all messages have been emitted to the sink. This occurs consistently unless the table is very small.

The same issue may occur if a changefeed with [`schema_change_policy='stop'`](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html#options) encounters a schema change. The changefeed may not emit any changes that occurred prior to the schema change being emitted.

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by [#90241](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/90241), which ensures all events correctly flush out of all buffers prior to the changefeed exiting.

The fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB [v22.1.10](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-10) and later.

This public issue is tracked by [#90146](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/90146).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB [v22.1.6](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-6) to [v22.1.9](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-9) are encouraged to upgrade to [v22.1.10](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-10) or a later version.

## Impact

Data expected to be emitted by changefeeds may not be complete.
