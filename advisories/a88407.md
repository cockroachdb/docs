## Description

In CockroachDB [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0) to [v22.1.7](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-7), querying a [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../stable/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) or [partitioned](../stable/partitioning.html) multi-region table with an [inverted index](../stable/inverted-indexes.html) could produce incorrect results if the query had a [`LIMIT`](../stable/limit-offset.html) of less than 100,000 and used the inverted index. In this case, it was possible that the [optimizer](../stable/cost-based-optimizer.html) would erroneously discard the predicate over the inverted index and therefore return some rows that did not match the predicate.

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by [#88079](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/88079).

The fix has been applied to the maintenance release of CockroachDB [v22.1.8](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-8).

This public issue is tracked by [#88047](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/88047).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0) to [v22.1.7](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-7) are encouraged to upgrade to [v22.1.8](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-8) or a later version.

To determine whether your queries may be affected by this issue on [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0) to [v22.1.7](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-7), you should examine the query plans of any [`LIMIT`](../stable/limit-offset.html) queries over [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../stable/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) or [partitioned](../stable/partitioning.html) multi-region tables with [inverted indexes](../stable/inverted-indexes.html) by using [`EXPLAIN (OPT)`](../stable/explain.html#opt-option). If the resulting plan shows [locality-optimized-search](../stable/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters), these queries may produce incorrect results.

For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
EXPLAIN(OPT)
  SELECT * FROM t88047
WHERE json_col->'loc' @> '{"state":"NY"}'
  LIMIT 2
~~~

~~~
----
index-join t88047
 └── locality-optimized-search
      ├── scan t88047@t88047_inv_idx
      │    ├── constraint: /11: [/'ap-southeast-2' - /'ap-southeast-2']
      │    └── limit: 2
      └── scan t88047@t88047_inv_idx
           ├── constraint: /18
           │    ├── [/'ca-central-1' - /'ca-central-1']
           │    └── [/'us-east-1' - /'us-east-1']
           └── limit: 2
~~~

Note that this query plan is incorrect: it should contain an "inverted constraint" with the JSON predicate, but it does not, which is why the query may return incorrect results. To mitigate this problem for affected queries on [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0) to [v22.1.7](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-7), either remove [inverted indexes](../stable/inverted-indexes.html) from all [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../stable/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) and [partitioned](../stable/partitioning.html) multi-region tables, or set the session setting `locality_optimized_partitioned_index_scan` or cluster setting `sql.defaults.locality_optimized_partitioned_index_scan.enabled` to false, which disables [locality-optimized-search](../stable/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters). 

The best mitigation, however, is to upgrade to [v22.1.8](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-8) as soon as possible.

## Impact

Some queries over [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../stable/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) or [partitioned](../stable/partitioning.html) multi-region tables with a [`LIMIT`](../stable/limit-offset.html) clause could produce incorrect results if the scanned index is `INVERTED` and uses an inverted constraint with [`JSONB`](../stable/jsonb.html) operators, [`ARRAY`](../stable/array.html) operators, or [operators](../stable/functions-and-operators.html#operators) on spatial data. Versions affected include [v22.1.0-alpha.1](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0-alpha-1) to [v22.1.7](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-7).
