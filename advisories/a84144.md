## Description

The problem affects multi-region tables whose locality has been altered to [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../{{ site.versions["stable"] }}/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) in clusters running versions [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0) to [v22.1.3](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-3). The problem occurs when [dropping a region](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/alter-database.html#drop-region): the drop may proceed when instead it should have yielded an error. Any subsequent attempt at changing the locality of the table will fail with an internal error.

This can be reproduced as follows in `cockroach demo --multitenant=false --global --nodes 9 --insecure --empty`:

~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE mr PRIMARY REGION "us-east1" REGIONS "us-west1";
> USE mr;
> CREATE TABLE kv(k INT PRIMARY KEY, v INT) LOCALITY REGIONAL BY TABLE IN PRIMARY REGION;
> ALTER TABLE kv SET LOCALITY REGIONAL BY ROW;
> INSERT INTO kv (crdb_region, k, v) VALUES ('us-east1', 1, 1);
> INSERT INTO kv (crdb_region, k, v) VALUES ('us-west1', 2, 2);
~~~

At this point the following statement should fail but instead succeeds:

~~~ sql
> ALTER DATABASE mr DROP REGION "us-west1";
~~~

After which the following statement fails instead of succeeding:

~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE kv SET LOCALITY GLOBAL;
ERROR: failed to construct index entries during backfill: error decoding 4 bytes: could not find [128] in enum "public.crdb_internal_region" representation PhysicalReps: [[64]]; LogicalReps: [us-east1] goroutine 45657 [running]:
~~~

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PRs [#84339](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/84339) and [#84349](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/84349) which ensure, respectively, that:
back-references to tables using the [region enum](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/alter-table.html#crdb_region) type are correctly updated in the region enum type descriptor when performing `ALTER TABLE … SET LOCALITY REGIONAL BY ROW;` any existing type descriptors which are already missing these back-references are updated prior to `ALTER DATABASE … DROP [SUPER] REGION` so as to ensure its correct behavior.

The fix has been applied to the maintenance release of CockroachDB [v22.1.4](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-4).

This public issue is tracked by [#84144](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/84144).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB v22.1.0 to v22.1.3 with multi-region databases are encouraged to upgrade to the maintenance version [v22.1.4](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-4) or above.

## Impact

Versions v22.1.0 to v22.1.3 are affected. In these versions, multi-region tables whose locality has been altered to `REGIONAL BY ROW` are at risk of being corrupted.
