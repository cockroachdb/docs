## Description

In 20.2, the implementation of [`TRUNCATE`](../stable/truncate.html) changed to keep the table ID stable.
Its new behavior is to replace the existing [indexes](../stable/indexes.html) with new, empty indexes.
This new code had a bug when it came to indexes which were not yet public (i.e., indexes which were still in the process of being added to the table).
A `TRUNCATE` would cause this partially-backfilled index to be made public instead of being dropped, exposing stale pre-truncation data to the query engine.

This issue affects CockroachDB [versions](/docs/releases/) 20.2.0 to 20.2.8.

## Statement

This bug was resolved by [#62944].

The fix has been applied to the maintenance release v20.2.9 of CockroachDB by PR [#63153].

This public issue is tracked by [#62842].

## Detection

1. Check for `TRUNCATE` in logs.

1. Check for out-of-order secondary index ID vs primary index ID:

~~~sql
  WITH descs AS (
				SELECT d
				  FROM (
						SELECT crdb_internal.pb_to_json(
								'cockroach.sql.sqlbase.Descriptor',
								descriptor,
								false
						       )->'table' AS d
						  FROM system.descriptor
				       )
				 WHERE d IS NOT NULL
             ),
       bad_descs AS (
					SELECT d, idx
					  FROM (
							SELECT d,
							       d->'primaryIndex'
									AS pi,
							       json_array_elements(
									d->'indexes'
							       ) AS idx
							  FROM descs
					       )
					 WHERE (pi->>'id')::INT8
					       > (idx->>'id')::INT8
                 )
SELECT database_name,
       schema_name,
       name AS table_name,
       table_id,
       idx->>'name' AS index_name,
       (idx->>'id')::INT8 AS index_id
  FROM crdb_internal.tables
  JOIN bad_descs ON (table_id = (d->>'id')::INT8);
~~~

In the following example of query output, the index `idx2` of table `tpcc.public.order_line` is identified as possibly corrupted:

~~~sql
  database_name | schema_name | table_name | table_id | index_name | index_id
----------------+-------------+------------+----------+------------+-----------
  tpcc          | public      | order_line |       58 | idx2       |        2
(1 row)
~~~

## Mitigation

Any suspect indexes should be dropped and rebuilt.

To prevent this issue, do not `TRUNCATE` a table while an index is being built.

Users of CockroachDB v20.2 are encouraged to upgrade to v20.2.9 or a later version.

## Impact

All deployments running CockroachDB versions 20.2.0 up to and including 20.2.8 are affected.
Cockroach Labs acknowledges the issue and has applied a fix that is available in subsequent maintenance releases for 20.2 (20.2.9 and later).
