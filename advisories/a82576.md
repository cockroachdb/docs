title: Technical Advisory 82576
advisory: A-82576
summary: Adding a column to a table which references a sequence, or creating a table with columns referencing sequences, adds an incomplete back-reference to the sequence metadata.

## Description

The problem occurs on clusters which were running [v21.1](../releases/v21.1.html) or an earlier version, and are now running versions [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0) to [v22.1.2](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-2). Adding a column to a table which references a sequence, or creating a table with columns referencing sequences, adds an incomplete back-reference to the sequence metadata. Upgrading to versions v22.1.0 or v22.1.2 then either fails outright, or succeeds but causes the sequences and the tables to become inoperable. The error message in those cases matches the regular expression:

`depended-on-by relation .* does not have a column with ID 0`

This problem can conclusively be diagnosed by running the following query:

~~~ sql
WITH
	tables
		AS (
			SELECT
				*
			FROM
				(
					SELECT
						id,
						crdb_internal.pb_to_json(
							'cockroach.sql.sqlbase.Descriptor',
							descriptor
						)->'table'
							AS tab
					FROM
						system.descriptor
				)
			WHERE
				tab IS NOT NULL
		),
	columns_using_sequence_ids
		AS (
			SELECT
				table_id,
				(c->'id')::INT8 AS column_id,
				json_array_elements(c->'usesSequenceIds')::INT8 AS seq_id
			FROM
				(
					SELECT
						id AS table_id, c
					FROM
						tables,
						ROWS FROM (json_array_elements(tab->'columns')) AS t (c)
				)
			WHERE
				(c->'usesSequenceIds') IS NOT NULL
				AND json_array_length(c->'usesSequenceIds') = 1
		),
	sequences_with_missing_depended_on_by
		AS (
			SELECT
				seq_id, (dep->>'id')::INT8 AS table_id, ord, dep
			FROM
				(
					SELECT
						id AS seq_id, dep, ord - 1 AS ord
					FROM
						tables,
						ROWS FROM (
							json_array_elements(tab->'dependedOnBy')
						) WITH ORDINALITY
							AS t (dep, ord)
					WHERE
						(tab->'sequenceOpts') IS NOT NULL
						AND EXISTS(
								SELECT
									*
								FROM
									ROWS FROM (
										json_array_elements(tab->'dependedOnBy')
									)
										AS t (dep)
								WHERE
									dep->'columnIds' @> '[0]'::JSONB
							)
				)
			WHERE
				(dep->>'byId')::BOOL
		)
SELECT
	count(*)
FROM
	sequences_with_missing_depended_on_by;
~~~

If you get back a non-zero result, your cluster has the problem described in this technical advisory. If you get back zero, your cluster does not have this problem.

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [#82833](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/82833) which relaxes the validation checks which detect descriptor corruption.

The fix has been applied to maintenance release [v22.1.3](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-3) of CockroachDB.

This public issue is tracked by [#82576](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/82576).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB v22.1.0 to v22.1.2 are encouraged to upgrade to [v22.1.3](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-3) or later.

Alternatively, users can run the following repair query:

If the query succeeds, that means the repair has succeeded. You can re-run the [diagnostic query](#description) to confirm this. We encourage users to [back up](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/backup-and-restore-overview.html) their clusters before undertaking such a repair.

## Impact

Clusters which have been upgraded from v21.1 to v22.1, and which are currently running versions v22.1.0 to v22.1.2, may be affected.

Questions about any technical alert can be directed to our [support team](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/).
