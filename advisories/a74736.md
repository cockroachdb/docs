Publication date: Jan 25, 2022

## Description

In very specific cases, queries can miss rows in a primary or unique index that is being scanned, causing incorrect query results. The problem can occur only when the query plan involves a scan when all of the following are true:

- Retrieves at least 4MB of data
- Spans multiple ranges
- Involves scanning isolated keys from the index (for example, derived from conditions involving `IN`).
-
Any CockroachDB deployment with an affected version can exhibit the issue, but it seems to be rare in practice.

Versions affected: <affected versions>

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [#75475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/75475) which fixes the metadata returned by the KV layer when some of the isolated key spans are not scanned.
The fix has been applied to maintenance releases of <comma separated list of versions that have the fix>.
This public issue is tracked by [#74736](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/74736).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB <affected versions> are encouraged to upgrade to <comma separated list of versions that have the fix> or a later version.

## Impact

Queries might have returned incorrect results in rare cases.
