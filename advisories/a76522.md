## Description

The [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) can omit `ON` conditions of [joins](../v21.2/joins.html) in query plans, causing incorrect results. The bug has only been observed when queries contained 4 or more joins, but it is possible that queries with fewer joins could be affected.

The bug is present in CockroachDB v20.2, v21.1, and v21.2.

This issue is fixed in [v21.1.16](../releases/v21.1.html#v21-1-16) and v21.2.7.

## Statement

This issue is resolved in CockroachDB by [#76334](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/76334). The fix has been applied to maintenance versions [v21.1.16](../releases/v21.1.html#v21-1-16) and v21.2.7 of CockroachDB.

This public issue is tracked as [#76522](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/76522).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB are encouraged to upgrade to a maintenance version with the fix applied.

## Impact

All deployments up to v20.2.19, v21.1.15, and v21.2.6 are affected.

Queries with joins could return incorrect results in rare cases. The bug has only been observed when queries contained 4 or more joins, but it is possible that queries with fewer joins could be affected.
