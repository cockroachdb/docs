## Description

A bug was introduced in CockroachDB v21.1.8 which would prevent downgrading to earlier v21.1.x patch versions. For this reason, we have removed v21.1.8 from our releases page.

## Statement

Patch releases are expected to maintain upgrade/downgrade/mixed-version compatibility, so a user can upgrade (for example) from v21.1.3 to v21.1.7 and back down to v21.1.5 at will.

A recent change was [backported to the release-21.1 branch](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/69157/files#diff-8f32466c40e6960b988c87d7e2453c01a591d420af123f0963959da8e580f2e4), that included a new cluster version, which was then included in the v21.1.8 release. This means a cluster that deploys v21.1.8 (and has the default automatic finalization enabled) will be unable to downgrade to v21.1.7 or earlier.

A future release, currently in development, will resolve this issue.

## Mitigation

Users should not upgrade to v21.1.8.

If you have already upgraded to v21.1.8, no action is necessary, but your v21.1.8 cluster is in a state where you must not downgrade to a previous patch release.

If you are running v21.1.7 or earlier, no action is necessary.

## Impact

Users who are running v21.1.8 cannot downgrade to a previous patch release.
