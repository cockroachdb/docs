## Description

The global [`NOSQLLOGIN` privilege](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#system-level-privileges) does not restrict SQL access as it should. This privilege is [granted](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html) using `GRANT SYSTEM NOSQLLOGIN TO <user>` but is not properly inspected by authorization checks. The bug was introduced in [v22.2.0-alpha.1](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0-alpha-1).

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by [#96466](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/96466)
and backported in [#96520](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/96520)) by fixing the logic that inspects the `NOSQLLOGIN` privilege.

The fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB [v22.2.4](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-4).

This public issue is tracked by https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/96465. 

## Mitigation

A workaround is to use the older role option syntax: [`ALTER ROLE <user> WITH NOSQLLOGIN`](../v22.2/alter-role.html). Note that unlike the global privilege, the role option does not get inherited by users who are members of the role.
Users of CockroachDB [v22.2.0](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0) through [v22.2.3](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-3) are encouraged to upgrade to [v22.2.4](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-4) or a later version.

## Impact

The `NOSQLLOGIN` global privilege does not correctly restrict SQL access. SQL users who should be blocked from running SQL commands are not blocked.
