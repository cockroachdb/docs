summary: If a <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> statement fails, all objects referenced in its <code>SELECT</code> query will be unusable.

## Description

The problem can occur on any cluster running versions [v21.2.0](../releases/v21.2.html#v21-2-0) to [v21.2.12](../releases/v21.2.html#v21-2-12) or [v22.1.0](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0). If a [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`](../stable/views.html#materialized-views) statement fails, all the tables, views, sequences and types referenced in its [`SELECT`](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/selection-queries.html) query will become unusable. Any statement or query referencing these objects will trigger an error matching the following regular expression:

    `invalid depended-on-by relation back reference: referenced table ID [0-9]*: referenced descriptor not found`


This problem can be diagnosed by running the following query:

~~~ sql
WITH
	tables
		AS (
			SELECT
				id, tab
			FROM
				(
					SELECT
						id,
						crdb_internal.pb_to_json(
							'cockroach.sql.sqlbase.Descriptor',
							descriptor
						)->'table'
							AS tab
					FROM
						system.descriptor
				)
			WHERE
				tab IS NOT NULL
		),
	old_depended_on_by_entries
		AS (
			SELECT
				id, json_array_elements(tab->'dependedOnBy') AS entry
			FROM
				tables
		),
	ids_of_descriptors_that_need_upsert
		AS (
			SELECT
				DISTINCT id
			FROM
				old_depended_on_by_entries
			WHERE
				(entry->>'id')::INT8 NOT IN (SELECT id FROM system.namespace)
		)
SELECT
	count(*)
FROM
	ids_of_descriptors_that_need_upsert;
~~~

If you get back a non-zero result, your cluster has the problem described in this technical advisory. If you get back zero, your cluster does not have this problem.

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [#82087](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/82087) which fixes the missing removal of back-references to the materialized view.

The fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB v21.2.13 and v22.1.1. This public issue is tracked by [#82079](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/82079).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB versions v21.2.0 to v21.2.12 or v22.1.0 are encouraged to upgrade to [v21.2.13](../releases/v21.2.html#v21-2-13) and [v22.1.1](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-1) or a later version. Upgrading to a later maintenance release will prevent this problem from appearing, but it will not fix the problem if it is already present.

If the problem is present according to the diagnostic query above, users can attempt a repair by executing the following:

~~~ sql
WITH
	tables
		AS (
			SELECT
				id, tab
			FROM
				(
					SELECT
						id,
						crdb_internal.pb_to_json(
							'cockroach.sql.sqlbase.Descriptor',
							descriptor
						)->'table'
							AS tab
					FROM
						system.descriptor
				)
			WHERE
				tab IS NOT NULL
		),
	old_depended_on_by_entries
		AS (
			SELECT
				id, json_array_elements(tab->'dependedOnBy') AS entry
			FROM
				tables
		),
	new_depended_on_by_entries
		AS (
			SELECT
				*
			FROM
				old_depended_on_by_entries
			WHERE
				(entry->>'id')::INT8 IN (SELECT id FROM system.namespace)
		),
	ids_of_descriptors_that_need_upsert
		AS (
			SELECT
				DISTINCT id
			FROM
				old_depended_on_by_entries
			WHERE
				(entry->>'id')::INT8 NOT IN (SELECT id FROM system.namespace)
		),
	new_depended_on_by_arrs
		AS (
			(
				SELECT
					id,
					json_agg(entry ORDER BY (entry->>'id')::INT8 ASC)
						AS new_depended_on_by_arr
				FROM
					new_depended_on_by_entries
				WHERE
					id IN (SELECT id FROM ids_of_descriptors_that_need_upsert)
				GROUP BY
					id
				UNION
					SELECT
						id, '[]'::JSONB AS new_depended_on_by_arr
					FROM
						ids_of_descriptors_that_need_upsert
					WHERE
						id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM new_depended_on_by_entries)
			)
			ORDER BY
				id
		)
SELECT
	crdb_internal.unsafe_upsert_descriptor(
		tables.id,
		crdb_internal.json_to_pb(
			'cockroach.sql.sqlbase.Descriptor',
			json_build_object(
				'table',
				json_remove_path(
					json_set(
						json_set(
							tab,
							ARRAY['dependedOnBy'],
							new_depended_on_by_arr
						),
						ARRAY['version'],
						((tab->>'version')::INT8 + 1)::STRING::JSONB
					),
					ARRAY['modificationTime']
				)
			)
		),
		true
	)
FROM
	tables
	JOIN new_depended_on_by_arrs ON tables.id = new_depended_on_by_arrs.id;
~~~

If the query succeeds, that means the repair has succeeded. You can rerun the [diagnostic query](#description) to confirm this. We encourage users to [back up](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/backup-and-restore-overview.html) their clusters before undertaking such a repair.

## Impact

This problem affects any cluster in which a materialized view has been unsuccessfully created while running versions v21.2.0 to v21.2.12 or v22.1.0. All objects depended upon by that view would become unusable.
