advisory: A-97932
summary: The SCRAM protocol had a high default hash count causing connection latency spikes for clients running on limited CPU.

## Description

Starting in CockroachDB v22.2.0 and above, CockroachDB switched to using the [SCRAM](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/security-reference/scram-authentication.html) protocol for password authentication by default. The SCRAM protocol dictates that the password hash is computed on the client side and sent to the server instead of sending a cleartext password. After testing we determined the optimal default hash cost (iteration count) to be `119680`. However, this default hashing cost was high for certain clients running on a limited amount of CPU, which resulted in higher than normal connection latency after upgrading to CockroachDB v22.2.0 and above. 

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [98254](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/98254), which sets the default hash cost value to `10610` using the cluster setting `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256`. This fix has been released in [22.2.7](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-7). 

The public issue is tracked by [97932](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/97932).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB v22.2.0 to v22.2.6, should set the value of the cluster setting `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256` to `10610`. You will also need to run [`ALTER USER ... WITH PASSWORD`](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}//alter-user.html#change-a-users-password) for every user in order to recompute the hash using the lower cost of `10610`.

Alternatively, if your application is unaffected or you are not experiencing an increase in connection latency, the [22.2.7](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-7) release of CockroachDB will include the lower default hashing cost. This will be applied automatically during the upgrade without any user intervention.

## Impact

Customers upgrading their CockroachDB versions to 22.2.0 and above may see an increase in connection latency after upgrade. Versions affected include all versions of CockroachDB v22.2.0 to v22.2.6.
