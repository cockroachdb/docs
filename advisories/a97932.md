title: Technical Advisory 97932
advisory: A-97932
summary: The SCRAM protocol had a high default hash count causing connection latency spikes for clients running on limited CPU.

## Description

Starting in CockroachDB v22.2.0 and above, CockroachDB switched to using the [SCRAM](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/security-reference/scram-authentication.html) protocol for password authentication by default. The SCRAM protocol dictates that the password hash is computed on the client side and sent to the server instead of sending a cleartext password. After testing we determined the optimal default hash cost (iteration count) to be `119680`. However, this default hashing cost was high for certain clients running on a limited amount of CPU, which resulted in higher than normal connection latency after upgrading to CockroachDB v22.2.0 and above. 

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [98254](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/98254), which sets the default hash cost value to `10610` using the cluster setting `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256`. This fix has been released in [22.2.7](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-7). 

The public issue is tracked by [97932](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/97932).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB v22.2.0 to v22.2.6, should set the value of the cluster setting `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256` to `10610`. You will also need to run [`ALTER USER ... WITH PASSWORD`](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}//alter-user.html#change-a-users-password) for every user in order to recompute the hash using the lower cost of `10610`.

Alternatively, if your application is unaffected or you are not experiencing an increase in connection latency, the v22.2.7 release of CockroachDB will include the lower default hashing cost. This will be applied automatically during the upgrade without any user intervention.

## Impact

Customers upgrading their CockroachDB versions to 22.2.0 and above may see an increase in connection latency after upgrade. Versions affected include all versions of CockroachDB v22.2.0 to v22.2.6.
