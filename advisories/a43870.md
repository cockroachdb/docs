title: Product Advisory 43870
summary: HTTP authentication for non-Enterprise users
toc: false
---

## Description

Following the fix for [Advisory 42567](a42567.html), CockroachDB from
versions 2.1.10, 19.1.6, and 19.2.2 onward now limit access to
privileged HTTP endpoints (privileged Admin UI pages and monitoring
APIs) to authenticated admin users. However, the SQL root user
specifically is currently not able to log in via HTTP.

## Statement

The root user is currently unable to use privileged HTTP endpoints
because root is prevented from having a password (this is a
CockroachDB feature from version 1.0 to 19.2, only lifted in 20.1) and
HTTP endpoints only support password authentication.

Without an enterprise license, the only SQL admin user is
root. Therefore, core users are unable to use these privileged HTTP
endpoints.

A [product
change](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/43872) is
planned to enable passwordless users including root to access HTTP
endpoints safely and without a license. This change will be
distributed in [CockroachDB
19.2.3](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/44110). This
solution will be usable with servers/clusters running versions 2.1,
19.1 and 19.2 without requiring a server upgrade. Starting in version
20.1, the root user will also be able to use a password and log in via
HTTP interactively.

This issue is tracked internally as [#43870](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/43870).

## Mitigation

Affected sites can obtain a temporary evaluation license, create a
user other than root, give it a password, grant it the admin role,
then let the evaluation license expire. The admin user created in this
manner will persist beyond the license expiry.

## Impact

All core users of CockroachDB 2.1.10, 19.1.6, and 19.2.2 without an
Enterprise license are affected.

Affected deployments are prevented from using privileged Admin UI
pages and monitoring HTTP endpoints.
