## Description

In CockroachDB [v22.2.0](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0) and [v22.2.1](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-1), if a [user-defined function (UDF)](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) is created using any implicit record type which contains a column of user-defined [`ENUM`](../v22.2/enum.html) type as the function’s parameter type or return type, the CockroachDB instance will crash and refuse to start. For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE TYPE e AS ENUM ('a', 'b');
CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b e);
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION f () RETURNS t AS
$$
  SELECT a, b
  FROM t
  ORDER BY a
  LIMIT 1;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL; -- CockroachDB cluster crashes when this query is run
~~~

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [#94106](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/94106) which fixes infinite recursion during the type hydration for catalog descriptors.

The fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB [v22.2.2](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-2) and later.

This public issue is tracked by [#93314](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/93314).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB [v22.2.0](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0) and [v22.2.1](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-1) should avoid creating a [user-defined function (UDF)](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) using any implicit record type that contains a field of user-defined [`ENUM`](../v22.2/enum.html) type as the function’s parameter type or return type.

Users of CockroachDB v22.2.0 and v22.2.1 are encouraged to upgrade to version v22.2.2 or later. 


## Impact

CockroachDB instances crash and refuse to start unless upgraded to v22.2.2 or a later version.
