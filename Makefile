# Install all our ruby dependencies in an isolated environment. We

# HACK: Make has a fast path and a slow path for command execution,
# but the fast path uses the PATH variable from when make was started,
# not the one we set on the previous line. In order for the above
# line to have any effect, we must force make to always take the slow path.
# Setting the SHELL variable to a value other than the default (/bin/sh)
# is one way to do this globally.
