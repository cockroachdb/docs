To deploy an insecure development or test cluster on AWS using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), see the configuration files and instructions in the [`aws`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/cloud/aws) directories of our main cockroach GitHub repository.

More AWS deployment docs coming soon.
