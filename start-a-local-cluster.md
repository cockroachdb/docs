Once you've [installed the CockroachDB binary](install-cockroachdb.html), it's simple to start a multi-node cluster locally with each node listening on a different port. 

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}Running multiple nodes on a single host is useful for testing out CockroachDB, but it's not recommended for production deployments. To run a physically distributed cluster in production, see <a href="manual-deployment.html">Manual Deployment</a> or <a href="cloud-deployment.html">Cloud Deployment</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<div id="toc"></div>

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have already:

- Installed the [CockroachDB binary](install-cockroachdb.html)
- Added the binary directory to your `PATH`

## Step 1. Start your first node

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --background

build:      {{site.data.strings.version}} @ {{site.data.strings.build_time}}
admin:      http://localhost:8080
sql:        postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable
logs:       cockroach-data/logs
store[0]:   path=cockroach-data
status:     initialized new cluster
clusterID:  {dab8130a-d20b-4753-85ba-14d8956a294c}
nodeID:     1
~~~

This command starts a node, accepting all [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) defaults.

- Communication is insecure, with the server listening only on `localhost` on port `26257` for internal and client communication and on port `8080` for HTTP requests from the Admin UI. 
   - To bind to different ports, set `--port=<port>` and `--http-port=<port>`. 
   - To bind the Admin UI to a private IP address or host, set `--http-host=<private-addr>`.
   - To listen on an external hostname or IP address, set `--insecure` and `--host=<external address>`. For a demonstration, see [Manual Deployment](manual-deployment.html). 

- Node data is stored in the `cockroach-data` directory. To store data in a different location, set `--store=<filepath>`. To use multiple stores, set this flag separately for each.

- The `--background` flag runs the node in the background so you can continue the next steps in the same shell. 

- The [standard output](start-a-node.html#standard-output) gives you a helpful summary: the CockroachDB version; the URL for the admin UI; the SQL URL for your client code; the storage locations for node and debug log data; whether the node is the first in the cluster, joined an existing cluster for the first time, or rejoined an existing cluster; the cluster ID; and the node ID.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}By default, each node's cache is limited to 25% of available memory. This default is reasonable when running one node per host. When running multiple nodes on a single host, however, it may lead to out of memory errors, especially when testing against the cluster in a serious way. To avoid such errors, you can manually limit each node's cache size by setting the <a href="start-a-node.html#flags"><code>--cache</code></a> flag in the <code>start</code> command.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 2. Join additional nodes to the cluster
   
~~~ shell
# Start your second node
$ cockroach start --store=node2 --port=26258 --http-port=8081 --join=localhost:26257 --background

# Start your third node
$ cockroach start --store=node3 --port=26259 --http-port=8082 --join=localhost:26257 --background
~~~

These commands add two nodes to the cluster, but you can add as many as you like. For each node:

- Set the `--store` flag to a storage location not in use by other nodes. To use multiple stores, set this flag separately for each.

- Set the `--port` and `--http-port` flags to ports not in use by other nodes.

- The `--join` flag connects the new node to the cluster. Set this flag to `localhost` and the port of the first node. 

- The `--background` flag runs the node in the background so you can continue the next steps in the same shell.

If you don't plan to use more than one node, you can avoid unnecessary log messages about replication by editing the default [replication zone](configure-replication-zones.html) to specify one node instead of three. See [here](troubleshoot.html#replicas-failing-on-a-single-node-cluster) for more details.

## Step 3. Use the built-in SQL client

Start the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) in interactive mode:

~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql
# Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit: CTRL + D.
~~~

Then run some [CockroachDB SQL statements](learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE bank;

> SET DATABASE = bank;

> CREATE TABLE accounts (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance DECIMAL);

> INSERT INTO accounts VALUES (1234, 10000.50);

> SELECT * FROM accounts;
~~~
~~~
+------+----------+
|  id  | balance  |
+------+----------+
| 1234 | 10000.50 |
+------+----------+
~~~

When you're done with the SQL shell, use **CTRL + D**, **CTRL + C**, or `\q` to exit.

## Step 4. Open the Admin UI

To check out the [Admin UI](explore-the-admin-ui.html) for your cluster, point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. You can also find the address in the `admin` field in the standard output of any node on startup.

## Step 5.  Stop the cluster

Once you're done looking through the Admin UI, you can stop the nodes (and therefore the cluster):

~~~ shell
$ cockroach quit
$ cockroach quit --port=26258
$ cockroach quit --port=26259
~~~

For more details about the `cockroach quit` command, see [Stop a Node](stop-a-node.html).
