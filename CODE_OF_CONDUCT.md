## Code of Conduct 

We value the participation of everyone in the CockroachDB community and want to create an environment that is welcoming, enjoyable, and fulfilling. 
When posting or participating in a community event or online forum, please use the following guidelines:

- Be specific and detailed. Include relevant details in your inquiries (eg. versions, error messages, deployment environment, etc.), and 
  avoid asking off-topic questions in existing discussion threads.
- Share experiences and knowledge publicly. Everyone can benefit from the exchange of knowledge, so we encourage all community members to 
  share their experience in public channels (at events, on the [forum](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/cockroachdb), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=cockroachdb), [Slack](https://go.crdb.dev/p/slack), etc.).
- Collaborate and help each other. If someone lacks knowledge in a particular area, help to educate and collaborate with them.
- Have patience. Many community members are volunteers, and it may take some time to get a response to your question.
- Be kind and respectful. Communication should be positive and constructive. Every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs, and there is seldom a right answer.
- Be good to each other. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean, or harass anyone. 
  Likewise any spamming, trolling, or baiting is not welcome.
- Finally, if you notice or are experiencing violations of this code of conduct or harassment of any kind, please reach out to **`@jseldess`** on GitHub or email  **`docs@cockroachlabs.com`** to help resolve the situation. 
    
  Thank you for helping make this a helpful and a welcoming community.
