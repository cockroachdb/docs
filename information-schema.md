title: Information Schema
summary: The information_schema database contains read-only views that you can use for introspection into your database's tables, columns, indexes, and views.

---

CockroachDB represents your cluster's schema in a database called `information_schema`, which contains read-only [views](views.html) that you can use for introspection into your database's tables, columns, indexes, and views.

This notion of an information schema is part of the SQL standard, which means it is portable and will remain stable. This contrasts with other objects like `pg_catalog`, which is not part of the SQL standard and handles specific implementation issues.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}The <code>information_schema</code> views typically represent objects that the current user has privilege to access. To ensure you can view your cluster's entire schema, access it as the <code>root</code> user.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Objects

To perform introspection on objects, you can either read from the related `information_schema` view or use one of CockroachDB's `SHOW` statements.

## Views

The `information_schema` database is comprised of many views representing your cluster's schema, each of which is detailed below.

### columns

The `columns` view contains information about the columns in each table.
