### Upgrade Notes

Due to changes in the on-disk format of internal range leases, this release cannot be run concurrently with any prior release. All servers running older versions must be stopped before starting any node with this version. [#10420](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10420)

We realize that "stop the world" upgrades are overly interruptive and are actively working on infrastructure improvements to drastically reduce the need for such upgrades in the future.

### SQL Language Changes

- Adding a [`FOREIGN KEY`](foreign-key.html) constraint now automatically creates any necessary index. [#9572](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9572)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_roles`, `pg_catalog.pg_description`, and `pg_catalog.pg_settings` tables are now supported. [#10377](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10377) [#10381](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10381) [#10293](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10293)
- New [functions](functions-and-operators.html) `from_ip()` and `to_ip()` convert between binary and textual IP address formats. [#10349](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10349)
- Tuple types can now be returned by queries. [#10380](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10380)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- `cockroach debug compact` now always rewrites all data, allowing it to pick up configuration changes. [#10532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10532)

### Performance Improvements

- Adding new replicas is now prioritized over removing dead ones. [#10492](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10492)
- Replicating ranges on to a new node is now more reliably performed back-to-back. [#10440](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10440)
- Raft log truncation is now aware of pending snapshots. [#10482](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10482)
- Replica garbage collection is now triggered more reliably by replication changes. [#10500](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10500)
- Old replicas that are blocking other operations are now prioritized for garbage collection. [#10426](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10426)
- Small clusters now run their replica scanners more frequently by default. [#10433](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10433)
- Reduced contention in the command queue for multi-range operations. [#10470](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10470)
- Operations that have already expired are no longer added to the command queue. [#10487](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10487)
- Reduced allocations for SQL row data. [#10534](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10534)

### Bug Fixes

- A node that is stopped and restarted quickly can no longer produce inconsistent results. [#10420](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10420)
- Replication snapshots now release their resources earlier, preventing deadlocks. [#10491](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10491)
- Fixed a bug with time series garbage collection when the time series data spans multiple ranges. [#10400](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10400)
- Fixed a bug with very large [`DECIMAL`](decimal.html) values or very small fractions. [#10446](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10446)
- The `pow()` [function](functions-and-operators.html) now returns an error when its arguments are too large. [#10525](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10525)
- Fixed a crash when the number of placeholders in a query doesn't match the number of arguments. [#10474](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10474)
- Improved error handling when a SQL [transaction](transactions.html) exceeds an internal deadline. [#9906](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9906)
- Fixed a panic in raft leadership transfers. [#10530](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10530)
- Fixed a leak in [`CREATE TABLE AS`](create-table-as.html) and [`CREATE VIEW`](create-view.html). [#10527](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10527)
