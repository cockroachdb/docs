title: Query Spatial Data
summary: Query a dataset of spatial data in CockroachDB.
toc: true
---

This page has instructions for querying spatial data imported into CockroachDB. On this page, we use a sample [Shapefile dataset](spatial-glossary.html#file-formats) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

## Before you begin

- Install a build of CockroachDB with support for spatial data by following the instructions at [Install CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).

- [Start a local insecure cluster](start-a-local-cluster.html) and connect to that cluster from a [SQL client](cockroach-sql.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach sql --insecure --host=localhost --port=26257
    ~~~

    Leave this shell open for use in the example below.

- Import some sample spatial data into CockroachDB by following the instructions at [Migrate from Shapefiles](migrate-from-shapefiles.html).

## Query spatial data

After you have imported [the sample tornado data into CockroachDB](migrate-from-shapefiles.html), you can query the spatial data from SQL.

For example, we may be interested in the [1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Oklahoma_tornado_outbreak), which is described by Wikipedia as:

> a significant tornado outbreak that affected much of the Central and parts of the Eastern United States, with the highest record-breaking wind speeds of 302 ± 22 mph (486 ± 35 km/h). During this week-long event, 154 tornadoes touched down (including one in Canada), more than half of them on May 3 and 4 when activity reached its peak over Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, and Arkansas.

According to the wiki page linked above, there were 152 tornadoes confirmed between May 2-8, 1999 (one in Canada).

We can try to verify this number against the NWS's tornado data set with the following query:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "1950-2018-torn-initpoint" WHERE yr = 1999 AND mo = 5 AND dy >= 02 AND dy <= 08;
~~~

~~~
  count
---------
    150
(1 row)
~~~

It might be interesting to look into why these numbers are different!

Next, let's get a list of starting points for all of the tornadoes in the outbreak that started in Oklahoma:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT ST_AsText(geom) FROM "1950-2018-torn-initpoint" WHERE yr = 1999 AND st = 'OK' AND mo = 5 AND dy > 02 AND dy <= 08;
~~~

~~~
                    st_astext

We can see that almost half of all of the tornadoes in this outbreak began in Oklahoma.

It might be interesting to draw these points on a map. The image below shows the points from the query above drawn as a simple polygon on a map of Oklahoma. The boxes around the polygon show the [spatial index](spatial-indexes.html) coverings for the polygon.
