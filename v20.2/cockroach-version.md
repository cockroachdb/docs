## Response

The `cockroach version` command outputs the following fields:

Field | Description
------|------------
`Build Tag` | The CockroachDB version. To return just the build tag, use `cockroach version --build-tag`.
`Build Time` | The date and time when the binary was built.
`Distribution` | The scope of the binary. If `CCL`, the binary contains functionality covered by both the CockroachDB Community License (CCL) and the Business Source License (BSL). If `OSS`, the binary contains only functionality covered by the Apache 2.0 license. The v19.2 release converts to Apache 2.0 as of Oct 1, 2022, at which time you can use the `make buildoss` command to build a pure open-source binary. For more details about licensing, see the [Licensing FAQs](licensing-faqs.html).
`Platform` | The platform that the binary can run on.
`Go Version` | The version of Go in which the source code is written.
`C Compiler` | The C compiler used to build the binary.
`Build Commit ID` | The SHA-1 hash of the commit used to build the binary.
`Build Type` | The type of release. If `release`, `release-gnu`, or `release-musl`, the binary is for a production [release](../releases/). If `development`, the binary is for a testing release.
