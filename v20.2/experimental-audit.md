title: EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT
summary: Use the EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT subcommand to turn SQL audit logging on or off for a table.
toc: true
---

`EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT` is a subcommand of [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.html) that is used to turn SQL audit logging on or off for a table.

SQL audit logs contain detailed information about queries being executed against your system, including:

- Full text of the query (which may include personally identifiable information (PII))
- Date/Time
- Client address
- Application name

For a detailed description of exactly what is logged, see the [Audit Log File Format](#audit-log-file-format) section below.

CockroachDB stores audit log information in a way that ensures durability, but negatively impacts performance. As a result, we recommend using SQL audit logs for security purposes only. For more information, see [Performance considerations](#performance-considerations).

## Synopsis

<div>
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/diagrams/experimental_audit.html %}
</div>

## Required privileges

Only members of the `admin` role can enable audit logs on a table. By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.

## Parameters

 Parameter    | Description                                              
--------------+----------------------------------------------------------
 `table_name` | The name of the table you want to create audit logs for.
 `READ`       | Log all table reads to the audit log file.               
 `WRITE`      | Log all table writes to the audit log file.              
 `OFF`        | Turn off audit logging.                                  

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
This command logs all reads and writes, and both the <code>READ</code> and <code>WRITE</code> parameters are required (as shown in the <a href="#examples">examples</a> below). In a future release, this should change to allow logging only reads, only writes, or both.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Audit log file format

The audit log file format is as shown below.  The numbers above each column are not part of the format; they correspond to the descriptions that follow.

[1]     [2]             [3]   [4]                  [5]                                          [6] [7a]   [7b]                 [7c]                    [7d]                                 [7e] [7f] [7g] [7h]  [7i]

1. Log level (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `FATAL`) and date (in YYMMDD format)
2. Time (in UTC)
3. Goroutine ID. This column is used for troubleshooting CockroachDB and may change its meaning at any time.
4. Where the log line was generated
5. Logging tags (the contents and order may vary)
   - Client address
   - Username
   - Node ID
6. Log entry counter
7. Log message:
   - a. Label indicating where the data was generated (useful for troubleshooting)
   - b. Current value of the [`application_name`](set-vars.html) session setting
   - c. Logging trigger:
       - The list of triggering tables and access modes for audit logs, since only certain (read/write) activities are added to the audit log
   - d. Full text of the query (Note: May contain PII)
   - e. Placeholder values, if any
   - f. Query execution time (in milliseconds)
   - g. Number of rows produced (e.g., for `SELECT`) or processed (e.g., for `INSERT` or `UPDATE`).
   - h. Status of the query
       - `OK` for success
       - `ERROR` otherwise
   - i. Number of times the statement was [retried automatically](transactions.html#automatic-retries) by the server so far.

## Audit log file storage location

By default, audit logs are stored in the [same directory](debug-and-error-logs.html#write-to-file) as the other logs generated by CockroachDB.

To store the audit log files in a specific directory, pass the `--sql-audit-dir` flag to [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If your deployment requires particular lifecycle and access policies for audit log files, point `--sql-audit-dir` at a directory that has permissions set so that only CockroachDB can create/delete files.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Performance considerations

To ensure [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) in audit logs, CockroachDB synchronously logs all of the activity of every user on a cluster in a way that is durable to system failures. Every query that causes a logging event must access the disk of the node on which audit logging is enabled. As a result, enabling SQL audit logs negatively impacts performance, and we recommend using SQL audit logs for security purposes only.

For debugging and troubleshooting on production clusters, the most performant way to log all queries is to turn on the [cluster-wide setting](cluster-settings.html) `sql.trace.log_statement_execute`. For details, see [Troubleshoot Query Behavior](query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#cluster-wide-execution-logs).

## Examples

### Turn on audit logging

Let's say you have a  `customers` table that contains personally identifiable information (PII). To turn on audit logs for that table, run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
ALTER TABLE customers EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET READ WRITE;
~~~

Now, every access of customer data is added to the audit log with a line that looks like the following:

~~~
I201028 16:09:18.076615 1376 sql/exec_log.go:207 ⋮ [n1,client=‹[::1]:59646›,hostnossl,user=root] 11 ‹exec› ‹"$ cockroach sql"› ‹{"customers"[63]:READ}› ‹"SELECT * FROM customers"› ‹{}› 0.447 2 ‹OK› 0
I201028 16:09:42.905889 1376 sql/exec_log.go:207 ⋮ [n1,client=‹[::1]:59646›,hostnossl,user=root] 12 ‹exec› ‹"$ cockroach sql"› ‹{"customers"[63]:READ}› ‹"SELECT nonexistent FROM customers"› ‹{}› 0.206 0 ‹ERROR› 0
~~~

To turn on auditing for more than one table, issue a separate `ALTER` statement for each table.

For a description of the log file format, see the [Audit Log File Format](#audit-log-file-format) section.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
For a more detailed example, see [SQL Audit Logging](sql-audit-logging.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Turn off audit logging

To turn off logging, issue the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
ALTER TABLE customers EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET OFF;
~~~
