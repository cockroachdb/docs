title: Vectorized Query Execution
summary: The CockroachDB vectorized SQL query execution engine processes query plans using a column-oriented model to improve performance.
toc: true
---

CockroachDB supports [column-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS#Column-oriented_systems) ("vectorized") query execution on all [CockroachDB data types](data-types.html).

Many SQL databases execute [query plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_plan) one row of table data at a time. Row-oriented execution models can offer good performance for [online transaction processing (OLTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing) queries, but suboptimal performance for [online analytical processing (OLAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) queries. The CockroachDB vectorized execution engine dramatically improves performance over [row-oriented execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS#Row-oriented_systems) by processing each component of a query plan on type-specific batches of column data.

## Configuring vectorized execution

 <span class="version-tag">New in v20.2:</span> By default, vectorized execution is enabled in CockroachDB.

You can configure vectorized execution with the `vectorize` [session variable](set-vars.html). The following options are supported:

Option    | Description
----------|------------
`on`   | Turns on vectorized execution for all queries on rows over the [`vectorize_row_count_threshold`](#setting-the-row-threshold-for-vectorized-execution) (1000 rows, by default).<br><br>**Default:** `vectorize=on`
`201auto` | Follows the [vectorized execution behavior of CockroachDB v20.1](../v20.1/vectorized-execution.html), instructing CockroachDB to use the vectorized execution engine on queries that use a constant amount of memory, on [data types supported by the vectorized engine in CockroachDB v20.1](../v20.1/data-types.html).
`off`  | Turns off vectorized execution for all queries.

For information about setting session variables, see [`SET` &lt;session variable&gt;](set-vars.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To see if CockroachDB will use the vectorized execution engine for a query, run a simple [`EXPLAIN`](explain.html) statement on the query. If `vectorize` is `true`, the query will be executed with the vectorized engine. If it is `false`, the row-oriented execution engine is used instead.

### Setting the row threshold for vectorized execution

The efficiency of vectorized execution increases with the number of rows processed. If you are querying a table with a small number of rows, it is more efficient to use row-oriented execution.

By default, vectorized execution is enabled for queries on tables of 1000 rows or more. If the number of rows in a table falls below 1000, CockroachDB uses the row-oriented execution engine instead.

For performance tuning, you can change the minimum number of rows required to use the vectorized engine to execute a query plan in the current session with the `vectorize_row_count_threshold` [session variable](set-vars.html).

## How vectorized execution works

When you issue a query, the gateway node (i.e., the node from which you issue the query) [parses the query and creates a physical plan](architecture/sql-layer.html#sql-parser-planner-executor) for execution on each node that receives the plan. If vectorized execution is enabled, the physical plan is sent to each node to be executed by the vectorized execution engine.

To see a detailed view of the vectorized execution plan for a query, run the [`EXPLAIN(VEC)`](explain.html#vec-option) statement on the query.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For information about vectorized execution in the context of the CockroachDB architecture, see [Query Execution](architecture/sql-layer.html#query-execution).

For detailed examples of vectorized query execution for hash and merge joins, see the blog posts [40x faster hash joiner with vectorized execution](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorized-hash-joiner/) and [Vectorizing the merge joiner in CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorizing-the-merge-joiner-in-cockroachdb/).

## Disk-spilling operations

The following operations require [memory buffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer) during execution:

- Global [sorts](query-order.html)
- [Unordered aggregations](query-order.html)
- [Hash joins](joins.html#hash-joins)
- [Merge joins](joins.html#merge-joins) on non-unique columns. Merge joins on columns that are guaranteed to have one row per value, also known as "key columns", can execute entirely in-memory.
- [Window functions](window-functions.html). Note that [support for window functions is limited in the vectorized execution engine](#window-functions).

If there is not enough memory allocated for an operation, CockroachDB will spill the intermediate execution results to disk. By default, the memory limit allocated per operator is 64MiB. You can change this limit with the `sql.distsql.temp_storage.workmem` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html).

You can also configure a node's total budget for in-memory query processing at node startup with the [`--max-sql-memory` flag](cockroach-start.html#general). If the queries running on the node exceed the memory budget, the node spills intermediate execution results to disk. The [`--max-disk-temp-storage` flag](cockroach-start.html#general) sets the maximum on-disk storage capacity. If the maximum on-disk storage capacity is reached, the query will return an error during execution.

## Known limitations

### Unsupported queries

The vectorized engine does not support queries containing:

- A join filtered with an [`ON` expression](joins.html#supported-join-conditions). See [tracking issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/38018).

### Window functions

Support for certain [window functions](window-functions.html) is limited in the vectorized execution engine. If a query includes an unsupported window function, the window function will be handled by the row-oriented execution engine. If the same query includes other, supported operations, those operations will be handled by the vectorized execution engine. See [tracking issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/37040).

### Spatial features

The vectorized engine does not support [working with spatial data](spatial-data.html). Queries with [geospatial functions](functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) or [spatial data](spatial-data.html) will revert to the row-oriented execution engine.
