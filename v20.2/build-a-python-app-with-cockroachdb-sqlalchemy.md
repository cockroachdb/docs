This tutorial shows you how build a simple Python application with CockroachDB and the [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) ORM. For the CockroachDB back-end, you'll use a temporary local cluster.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The example code on this page uses Python 3.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
SQLAlchemy relies on the existence of [foreign keys](foreign-key.html) to generate [`JOIN` expressions](joins.html) from your application code. If you remove foreign keys from your schema, SQLAlchemy won't generate joins for you. As a workaround, you can [create a "custom foreign condition" by adding a `relationship` field to your table objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37806625/sqlalchemy-create-relations-but-without-foreign-key-constraint-in-db), or do the equivalent work in your application.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 1. Install SQLAlchemy

To install SQLAlchemy, as well as a [CockroachDB Python package](https://github.com/cockroachdb/sqlalchemy-cockroachdb) that accounts for some differences between CockroachDB and PostgreSQL, run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ pip install sqlalchemy sqlalchemy-cockroachdb psycopg2
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
You can substitute psycopg2 for other alternatives that include the psycopg python package.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For other ways to install SQLAlchemy, see the [official documentation](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/intro.html#installation-guide).

## Step 2. Start CockroachDB

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/start-cockroachdb.md %}

## Step 3. Create a database

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/create-a-database.md %}

## Step 4. Run the Python code

The code below uses [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) to map Python objects and methods to SQL operations.

You can run this script as many times as you want; on each run, the script will create some new accounts and shuffle money around between randomly selected accounts.

Specifically, the script:

1. Reads in existing account IDs (if any) from the `bank` database.
2. Creates additional accounts with randomly generated IDs. Then, it adds a bit of money to each new account.
3. Chooses two accounts at random and takes half of the money from the first and deposits it into the second.

It does all of the above using the practices we recommend for using SQLAlchemy with CockroachDB, which are listed in the [Best practices](#best-practices) section below.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You must use the `cockroachdb://` prefix in the URL passed to [`sqlalchemy.create_engine`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html?highlight=create_engine#sqlalchemy.create_engine) to make sure the [`cockroachdb`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/sqlalchemy-cockroachdb) dialect is used. Using the `postgres://` URL prefix to connect to your CockroachDB cluster will not work.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Get the code

Copy the code below or
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/{{page.version.version}}/app/python/sqlalchemy/example.py">download it directly</a>.

If you prefer, you can also clone a version of the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cockroachlabs/hello-world-python-sqlalchemy/
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ python
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/python/sqlalchemy/example.py %}
~~~

### Update the connection parameters

In the `create_engine()` function, update the connection string as follows:

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="local">

- Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the SQL username and password that you created earlier.
- Replace `<hostname>` and `<port>` with the hostname and port in the `(sql/tcp)` connection string from SQL shell welcome text.

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="cockroachcloud">

- Comment out the connection string for `cockroach demo`, and uncomment the connection string for CockroachCloud.
- Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the SQL username and password that you created in the CockroachCloud Console.
- Replace `<globalhost>` with the name of the CockroachCloud free tier host (e.g., `free-tier.gcp-us-central1.cockroachlabs.cloud`).
- Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your cluster.
- Replace `<certs_dir>/<ca.crt>` with the path to the CA certificate that you downloaded from the CockroachCloud Console.

</section>

### Run the code

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ python3 example.py
~~~

The output should look something like the following:

## Best practices

### Use the `run_transaction` function

We strongly recommend using the [`cockroachdb.sqlalchemy.run_transaction()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/sqlalchemy-cockroachdb/blob/master/cockroachdb/sqlalchemy/transaction.py) function as shown in the code samples on this page. This abstracts the details of [transaction retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) away from your application code. Transaction retries are more frequent in CockroachDB than in some other databases because we use [optimistic concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) rather than locking. Because of this, a CockroachDB transaction may have to be tried more than once before it can commit. This is part of how we ensure that our transaction ordering guarantees meet the ANSI [SERIALIZABLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Serializable) isolation level.

In addition to the above, using `run_transaction` has the following benefits:

- Because it must be passed a [sqlalchemy.orm.session.sessionmaker](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html#session-and-sessionmaker) object (*not* a [session][session]), it ensures that a new session is created exclusively for use by the callback, which protects you from accidentally reusing objects via any sessions created outside the transaction.
- It abstracts away the [client-side transaction retry logic](transactions.html#client-side-intervention) from your application, which keeps your application code portable across different databases. For example, the sample code given on this page works identically when run against Postgres (modulo changes to the prefix and port number in the connection string).

For more information about how transactions (and retries) work, see [Transactions](transactions.html).

### Avoid mutations of session and/or transaction state inside `run_transaction()`

In general, this is in line with the recommendations of the [SQLAlchemy FAQs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_basics.html#session-frequently-asked-questions), which state (with emphasis added by the original author) that

> As a general rule, the application should manage the lifecycle of the session *externally* to functions that deal with specific data. This is a fundamental separation of concerns which keeps data-specific operations agnostic of the context in which they access and manipulate that data.

and

> Keep the lifecycle of the session (and usually the transaction) **separate and external**.

In keeping with the above recommendations from the official docs, we **strongly recommend** avoiding any explicit mutations of the transaction state inside the callback passed to `run_transaction`, since that will lead to breakage. Specifically, do not make calls to the following functions from inside `run_transaction`:

- [`sqlalchemy.orm.Session.commit()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html?highlight=commit#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.commit) (or other variants of `commit()`): This is not necessary because `cockroachdb.sqlalchemy.run_transaction` handles the savepoint/commit logic for you.
- [`sqlalchemy.orm.Session.rollback()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html?highlight=rollback#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.rollback) (or other variants of `rollback()`): This is not necessary because `cockroachdb.sqlalchemy.run_transaction` handles the commit/rollback logic for you.
- [`Session.flush()`][session.flush]: This will not work as expected with CockroachDB because CockroachDB does not support nested transactions, which are necessary for `Session.flush()` to work properly. If the call to `Session.flush()` encounters an error and aborts, it will try to rollback. This will not be allowed by the currently-executing CockroachDB transaction created by `run_transaction()`, and will result in an error message like the following: `sqlalchemy.orm.exc.DetachedInstanceError: Instance <FooModel at 0x12345678> is not bound to a Session; attribute refresh operation cannot proceed (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/bhk3)`.

### Break up large transactions into smaller units of work

If you see an error message like `transaction is too large to complete; try splitting into pieces`, you are trying to commit too much data in a single transaction. As described in our [Cluster Settings](cluster-settings.html) docs, the size limit for transactions is defined by the `kv.transaction.max_intents_bytes` setting, which defaults to 256 KiB. Although this setting can be changed by an admin, we strongly recommend against it in most cases.

Instead, we recommend breaking your transaction into smaller units of work (or "chunks"). A pattern that works for inserting large numbers of objects using `run_transaction` to handle retries automatically for you is shown below.

~~~ python
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/python/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy-large-txns.py %}
~~~

### Use `IMPORT` to read in large data sets

If you are trying to get a large data set into CockroachDB all at once (a bulk import), avoid writing client-side code that uses an ORM and use the [`IMPORT`](import.html) statement instead. It is much faster and more efficient than making a series of [`INSERT`s](insert.html) and [`UPDATE`s](update.html) such as are generated by calls to [`session.bulk_save_objects()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_api.html?highlight=bulk_save_object#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.bulk_save_objects).

For more information about importing data from Postgres, see [Migrate from Postgres](migrate-from-postgres.html).

For more information about importing data from MySQL, see [Migrate from MySQL](migrate-from-mysql.html).

### Prefer the query builder

In general, we recommend using the query-builder APIs of SQLAlchemy (e.g., [`Engine.execute()`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html?highlight=execute#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine.execute)) in your application over the [Session][session]/ORM APIs if at all possible. That way, you know exactly what SQL is being generated and sent to CockroachDB, which has the following benefits:

- It's easier to debug your SQL queries and make sure they are working as expected.
- You can more easily tune SQL query performance by issuing different statements, creating and/or using different indexes, etc. For more information, see [SQL Performance Best Practices](performance-best-practices-overview.html).
