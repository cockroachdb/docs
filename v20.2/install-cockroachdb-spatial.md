This page has instructions for installing CockroachDB Spatial on Mac and Linux.

If you are looking to install a single-file CockroachDB binary without [spatial features](spatial-features.html), see [Install CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).

For instructions showing how to get started using CockroachDB Spatial, see [Working with Spatial Data](spatial-data.html).  For more information about supported spatial features, see [Spatial features](spatial-features.html)

## Step 1. Download and extract the binary and supporting spatial libraries

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
wget https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-v20.2.0-rc.4.darwin-10.9-amd64.tgz
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
tar xzvf cockroach-v20.2.0-rc.4.darwin-10.9-amd64.tgz
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cd cockroach-v20.2.0-rc.4.darwin-10.9-amd64
~~~

## Step 2. Copy the binary and libraries to the appropriate locations

First, copy the `cockroach` binary to [the standard location for user-installed binaries](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=hier&sektion=7), and make sure it's marked as executable:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cp cockroach /usr/local/bin/
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/cockroach
~~~

Next, copy the libraries to the location where CockroachDB expects to find them, in `/usr/local/lib/cockroach`. This is necessary because CockroachDB uses a custom-built version of the [GEOS](spatial-glossary.html#geos) libraries.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/cockroach
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cp lib/libgeos.dylib /usr/local/lib/cockroach/
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cp lib/libgeos_c.dylib /usr/local/lib/cockroach/
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
By default, CockroachDB looks for spatial libraries in the following locations:
<ul>
  <li>`/usr/local/lib/cockroach`</li>
  <li>A `lib` subdirectory of the CockroachDB binary's current directory.</li>
</ul>
You can change the location where CockroachDB looks for spatial libraries by passing the [`--spatial-libs` flag to `cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html#flags-spatial-libs).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 3. Test the installation

To make sure that CockroachDB Spatial is properly installed and can execute spatial queries, do the steps listed below.

1. Make sure the `cockroach` binary we just installed is the one that runs when you type `cockroach` in your shell:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    which cockroach
    ~~~

    ~~~
    /usr/local/bin/cockroach
    ~~~

2. Start the `cockroach` binary using [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach start-single-node --insecure --background --listen-addr=localhost
    ~~~

    This should generate output that looks like the following:

    ~~~
    *
    * WARNING: RUNNING IN INSECURE MODE!
    * 
    * - Your cluster is open for any client that can access localhost.
    * - Any user, even root, can log in without providing a password.
    * - Any user, connecting as root, can read or write any data in your cluster.
    * - There is no network encryption nor authentication, and thus no confidentiality.
    * 
    * Check out how to secure your cluster: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.2/secure-a-cluster.html
    *
    ~~~

3. Run the following command to test that the spatial libraries have loaded properly:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach sql --insecure -e 'SELECT ST_IsValid(ST_MakePoint(1,2))'
    ~~~

    This should result in the output shown below.

    ~~~
      st_isvalid
    --------------
         true
    (1 row)
    ~~~

    If your `cockroach` binary is not properly accessing the dynamically linked C libraries in `/usr/local/lib/cockroach` for some reason, it will output a message like the one shown below.

    ~~~
    ERROR: st_isvalid(): geos: error during GEOS init: geos: cannot load GEOS from dir "/usr/local/lib/cockroach": failed to execute dlopen
    Failed running "sql"
    ~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cp lib/libgeos.so /usr/local/lib/cockroach/
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cp lib/libgeos_c.so /usr/local/lib/cockroach/
~~~

    /usr/local/bin/cockroach
    ~~~

2. Start the `cockroach` binary using [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach start-single-node --insecure --background --listen-addr=localhost

    ~~~
    *
    * WARNING: RUNNING IN INSECURE MODE!
