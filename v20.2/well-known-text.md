The Well Known Text format (hereafter _WKT_) provides a text representation of a geometric shape.  It can be used to:

- Build instances of various shapes (e.g., using `ST_MakePolygon` on a Linestring).
- Convert existing shapes to a text representation for ease of reading and understanding by humans.

Each shape in WKT has a _tag_ which says what it is, usually followed by a list of coordinates.  For example, here are some common tags:

- `POINT(...)`
- `LINESTRING(...)`
- `POLYGON((...))`

WKT is technically case insensitive, but is sometimes displayed using "CamelCase" for easier reading.  For example, one can represent a MultiPolygon as either of:

- `MULTIPOLYGON(...)`
- `MultiPolygon(...)`

When a shape is made up of homogeneous subcomponents, such as a polygon made up of various points, the subcomponents do not need to have their own tags, e.g.,

- `LINESTRING(-88.243385 40.116421, -87.906471 43.038902, -95.992775 36.153980)`

Shapes expressed in WKT can have an [SRID](spatial-glossary.html) prepended to the shape and followed by a semicolon, in the form `SRID=123;TAG(...)`.  The format is known as Extended Well Known Text (_EWKT_); it is the same as WKT, with an [SRID](spatial-glossary.html#srid) representation prepended to the data structure.

For example, below is a polygon representing a geometry that uses [SRID 4326](srid-4326.html), which is used to represent latitude and longitude coordinates on the Earth as defined in the [WGS84](spatial-glossary.html#wgs84) standard:

- `SRID=4326;POLYGON((-87.906471 43.038902, -95.992775 36.153980, -75.704722 36.076944, -87.906471 43.038902))`
