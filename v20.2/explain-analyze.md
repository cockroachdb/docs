title: EXPLAIN ANALYZE
summary: The EXPLAIN ANALYZE statement executes a query and generates a physical query plan with execution statistics.
toc: true
---

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` [statement](sql-statements.html) **executes a SQL query** and generates a URL for a physical query plan with execution statistics, or a URL to download a bundle with more details about the query plan. Query plans provide information around SQL execution, which can be used to troubleshoot slow queries by figuring out where time is being spent, how long a processor (i.e., a component that takes streams of input rows and processes them according to a specification) is not doing work, etc. For more information about distributed SQL queries, see the [DistSQL section of our SQL Layer Architecture docs](architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql).

## Aliases

In CockroachDB, the following are aliases for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:

- `EXPLAIN ANALYSE`

## Synopsis

<div>{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/diagrams/explain_analyze.html %}</div>

## Parameters

Parameter          | Description
-------------------|-----------
`DISTSQL`          | _(Default)_ Generate a link to a distributed SQL physical query plan tree. For more information, see [Default option](#default-option).
`DEBUG`            |  Generate a ZIP file containing files with detailed information about the query and the database objects referenced in the query. For more information, see [`DEBUG` option](#debug-option).
`preparable_stmt`  | The [statement](sql-grammar.html#preparable_stmt) you want to execute and analyze. All preparable statements are explainable.

## Required privileges

The user requires the appropriate [privileges](authorization.html#assign-privileges) for the statement being explained.

## Success responses

Successful `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)`) statements return a table with the following columns:

 Column | Description
--------|------------
**automatic** | If `true`, the query is distributed. For more information about distributed SQL queries, see the [DistSQL section of our SQL Layer Architecture docs](architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql).
**url** | The URL generated for a physical query plan that provides high level information about how a query will be executed. For details about reading the physical query plan, see [DistSQL Plan Viewer](#distsql-plan-viewer).<br><br>{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/physical-plan-url.md %}

If you use the [`DEBUG` option](#debug-option), the statement will return a single `text` column with a URL and instructions to download the `DEBUG` bundle, which includes the physical query plan.

## Default option

By default, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` uses the `DISTQL` option, which generates a physical query plan diagram in the [DistSQL Plan Viewer](#distsql-plan-viewer). `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` produce the same output.

### DistSQL Plan Viewer

The DistSQL Plan Viewer displays the physical query plan, as well as execution statistics. The statistics listed depend on the query type and the [execution engine used](vectorized-execution.html).

Field | Description | Execution engine
------+-------------+----------------
&lt;Processor&gt;/&lt;id&gt; | The processor and processor ID used to read data into the SQL execution engine.<br><br>A processor is a component that takes streams of input rows, processes them according to a specification, and outputs one stream of rows. For example, a "TableReader" processor reads in data, and an "Aggregator" aggregates input rows. | Both
&lt;table&gt;@&lt;index&gt; | The index used by the processor. | Both
Spans | The interval of the key space read by the processor. For example, `[/1 - /1]` indicates that only the key with value `1` is read by the processor. | Both
Out | The output columns. | Both
batches output | The number of batches of columnar data output. | Vectorized engine only
tuples output | The number of rows output. | Vectorized engine only
IO time | How long the TableReader processor spent reading data from disk. | Vectorized engine only
stall time | How long the processor spent not doing work. This is aggregated into the stall time numbers as the query progresses down the tree (i.e., stall time is added up and overlaps with previous time). | Row-oriented engine only
bytes read | The size of the data read by the processor. | Both
rows read | The number of rows read by the processor. | Both
@&lt;n&gt; | The index of the column relative to the input. | Both
max memory used | How much memory (if any) is used to buffer rows. | Row-oriented engine only
max disk used | How much disk (if any) is used to buffer data. Routers and processors will spill to disk buffering if there is not enough memory to buffer the data. | Row-oriented engine only
execution time | How long the engine spent executing the processor. | Vectorized engine only
max vectorized memory allocated | How much memory is allocated to the processor to buffer batches of columnar data. | Vectorized engine only
max vectorized disk used | How much disk (if any) is used to buffer columnar data. Processors will spill to disk buffering if there is not enough memory to buffer the data. | Vectorized engine only
left(@&lt;n&gt;)=right(@&lt;n&gt;) | The equality columns used in the join. | Both
stored side | The smaller table that was stored as an in-memory hash table. | Both
rows routed | How many rows were sent by routers, which can be used to understand network usage. | Row-oriented engine only
bytes sent | The number of actual bytes sent (i.e., encoding of the rows). This is only relevant when doing network communication. | Both
Render | The stage that renders the output. | Both
by hash | _(Orange box)_ The router, which is a component that takes one stream of input rows and sends them to a node according to a routing algorithm.<br><br>For example, a hash router hashes columns of a row and sends the results to the node that is aggregating the result rows. | Both
unordered / ordered | _(Blue box)_ A synchronizer that takes one or more output streams and merges them to be consumable by a processor. An ordered synchronizer is used to merge ordered streams and keeps the rows in sorted order. | Both
&lt;data type&gt; |  If [`EXPLAIN(DISTSQL, TYPES)`](explain.html#distsql-option) is specified, lists the data types of the input columns. | Both
Response | The response back to the client. | Both

## `DEBUG` option

 `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)` executes a query and generates a link to a ZIP file that contains the [physical query plan](#distsql-plan-viewer), execution statistics, statement tracing, and other information about the query.

        File        | Description
--------------------+-------------------
`stats-<table>.sql` | Contains [statistics](create-statistics.html) for a table in the query.
`schema.sql`        | Contains [`CREATE`](create-table.html) statements for objects in the query.
`env.sql`           | Contains information about the CockroachDB environment.
`trace.txt`         | Contains [statement traces](show-trace.html) in plaintext format.
`trace.json`        | Contains [statement traces](show-trace.html) in JSON format.
`trace-jaeger.json` | Contains [statement traces](show-trace.html) in JSON format that can be [imported to Jaeger](query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#visualize-statement-traces-in-jaeger).
`distsql.html`      | The query's [physical query plan](#distsql-plan-viewer). This diagram is identical to the one generated by [`EXPLAIN(DISTSQL)`](explain.html#distsql-option)
`plan.txt`          | The query execution plan. This is identical to the output of [`EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)`](explain.html#verbose-option).
`opt-vv.txt`        | The query plan tree generated by the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html), with cost details and input column data types. This is identical to the output of [`EXPLAIN (OPT, TYPES)`](explain.html#opt-option).
`opt-v.txt`         | The query plan tree generated by the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html), with cost details. This is identical to the output of [`EXPLAIN (OPT, VERBOSE)`](explain.html#opt-option).
`opt.txt`           | The query plan tree generated by the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html). This is identical to the output of [`EXPLAIN (OPT)`](explain.html#opt-option).
`statement.txt`     | The SQL statement for the query.

You can obtain this ZIP file by following the link provided in the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)` output, or by activating [statement diagnostics](ui-statements-page.html#diagnostics) in the DB Console.

## Examples

### `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` without an option, or equivalently with the `DISTSQL` option, to execute a query and generate a link to a physical query plan with execution statistics.

For example, the following `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement executes a simple query against the [TPC-H database](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/) loaded to a 3-node CockroachDB cluster, and then generates a link to a physical query plan with execution statistics:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT l_shipmode, AVG(l_extendedprice) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_shipmode;
~~~

~~~
  automatic |                      url
------------+-----------------------------------------------
    true    | https://cockroachdb.github.io/distsqlplan...
~~~

To view the [DistSQL Plan Viewer](#distsql-plan-viewer), point your browser to the URL provided:

<img src="{{ 'images/v20.2/explain-analyze-distsql-plan.png' | relative_url }}" alt="EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />


### `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`

Use the [`DEBUG`](#debug-option) option to generate a ZIP file containing files with information about the query and the database objects referenced in the query. For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG) SELECT l_shipmode, AVG(l_extendedprice) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_shipmode;
~~~

~~~
                                      text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Statement diagnostics bundle generated. Download from the Admin UI (Advanced
  Debug -> Statement Diagnostics History), via the direct link below, or using
  the command line.
  Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:26258
  Direct link: http://127.0.0.1:26258/_admin/v1/stmtbundle/...
  Command line: cockroach statement-diag list / download
