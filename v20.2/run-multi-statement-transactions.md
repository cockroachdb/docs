This page has instructions for running [multi-statement transactions](transactions.html#batched-statements) against CockroachDB from various programming languages.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have already:

- Set up a [local cluster](secure-a-cluster.html).
- [Installed a Postgres client](install-client-drivers.html).
- [Connected to the database](connect-to-the-database.html).
- [Inserted data](insert-data.html) that you now want to run queries against.

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/retry-errors.md %}

BEGIN;
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
DELETE orders WHERE customer = 1;
COMMIT;

For more information about how to use the built-in SQL client, see the [`cockroach sql`](cockroach-sql.html) reference docs.

The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Go code is to use one of the following approaches:

- Use the [`crdb` transaction wrapper](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-go/tree/master/crdb) which automatically handles transaction retry errors if they occur, as shown in [Build a Go App with CockroachDB](build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb.html).

- Write your own retry loop wrapper, as shown in [Build a Go App with CockroachDB and GORM](build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb-gorm.html)

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="java">

The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Java is to write a wrapper method that automatically handles transaction retry errors.

For complete examples showing how to write and use such wrapper methods, see [Build a Java App with CockroachDB](build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html).

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="python">

The best way to run a multi-statement transaction from Python code is to use one of the following approaches:

- Use the [sqlalchemy-cockroachdb](https://github.com/cockroachdb/sqlalchemy-cockroachdb) SQLAlchemy dialect, which automatically handles transaction retry errors if they occur, as shown in [Build a Python App with CockroachDB and SQLAlchemy](build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-sqlalchemy.html).

- Write your own retry loop wrapper, as shown in [Build a Python App with CockroachDB](build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb.html).
