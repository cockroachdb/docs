This tutorial shows you how build a simple Java application with CockroachDB and the Hibernate ORM.

We have tested the [Hibernate ORM](http://hibernate.org/) enough to claim **beta-level** support. If you encounter problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/new) with details to help us make progress toward full support.

## Before you begin

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/before-you-begin.md %}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The examples on this page assume you are using a Java version <= 9. They do not work with Java 10.

## Step 1. Install the Gradle build tool

This tutorial uses the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) to get all dependencies for your application, including Hibernate.

To install Gradle on Mac, run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ brew install gradle
~~~

To install Gradle on a Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ apt-get install gradle
~~~

To install Gradle on a Red Hat-based Linux distribution like Fedora:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ dnf install gradle
~~~

For other ways to install Gradle, see [its official documentation](https://gradle.org/install).

## Step 2. Create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/create-maxroach-user-and-bank-database.md %}

## Step 3. Generate a certificate for the `maxroach` user

Create a certificate and key for the `maxroach` user by running the following command. The code samples will run as this user.

You can pass the [`--also-generate-pkcs8-key` flag](cockroach-cert.html#flag-pkcs8) to generate a key in [PKCS#8 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208), which is the standard key encoding format in Java. In this case, the generated PKCS8 key will be named `client.maxroach.key.pk8`.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach cert create-client maxroach --certs-dir=certs --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key --also-generate-pkcs8-key
~~~

## Step 4. Run the Java code

The code below uses Hibernate to map Java methods to SQL operations. It perform the following steps which roughly correspond to method calls in the `Sample` class.

1. Create an `accounts` table in the `bank` database as specified by the Hibernate `Account` class.
2. Inserts rows into the table using `session.save(new Account(int id, int balance))` (see `Sample.addAccounts()`).
3. Transfer money from one account to another, printing out account balances before and after the transfer (see `transferFunds(long fromId, long toId, long amount)`).
4. Print out account balances before and after the transfer (see `Sample.getAccountBalance(long id)`).

In addition, the code shows a pattern for automatically handling [transaction retries](transactions.html#client-side-intervention-example) by wrapping transactions in a higher-order function `Sample.runTransaction()`. It also includes a method for testing the retry handling logic (`Sample.forceRetryLogic()`), which will be run if you set the `FORCE_RETRY` variable to `true`.

It does all of the above using the practices we recommend for using Hibernate (and the underlying JDBC connection) with CockroachDB, which are listed in the [Recommended Practices](#recommended-practices) section below.

To run it:

1. Download and extract [hibernate-basic-sample.tgz](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/raw/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/hibernate-basic-sample/hibernate-basic-sample.tgz). The settings in [`hibernate.cfg.xml`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/raw/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/hibernate-basic-sample/hibernate.cfg.xml) specify how to connect to the database.
2. Compile and run the code using [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/raw/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/hibernate-basic-sample/build.gradle), which will also download the dependencies.

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ gradle run
    ~~~

The contents of [`Sample.java`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/{{page.version.version}}/app/hibernate-basic-sample/Sample.java):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/hibernate-basic-sample/Sample.java %}
~~~

Toward the end of the output, you should see:

~~~
APP: BEGIN;
APP: addAccounts() --> 1
APP: COMMIT;
APP: BEGIN;
APP: getAccountBalance(1) --> 1000
APP: COMMIT;
APP: BEGIN;
APP: getAccountBalance(2) --> 250
APP: COMMIT;
APP: getAccountBalance(1) --> 1000
APP: getAccountBalance(2) --> 250
APP: BEGIN;
APP: transferFunds(1, 2, 100) --> 100
APP: COMMIT;
APP: transferFunds(1, 2, 100) --> 100
APP: BEGIN;
APP: getAccountBalance(1) --> 900
APP: COMMIT;
APP: BEGIN;
APP: getAccountBalance(2) --> 350
APP: COMMIT;
APP: getAccountBalance(1) --> 900
APP: getAccountBalance(2) --> 350
~~~

To verify that the account balances were updated successfully, start the [built-in SQL client](cockroach-sql.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --certs-dir=certs
~~~

To check the account balances, issue the following statement:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT id, balance FROM accounts;
~~~

~~~
  id | balance
+----+---------+
   1 |     900
   2 |     350
   3 |  314159
(3 rows)
~~~

## Recommended Practices

### Use `IMPORT` to read in large data sets

If you are trying to get a large data set into CockroachDB all at once (a bulk import), avoid writing client-side code altogether and use the [`IMPORT`](import.html) statement instead. It is much faster and more efficient than making a series of [`INSERT`s](insert.html) and [`UPDATE`s](update.html). It bypasses the [SQL layer](architecture/sql-layer.html) altogether and writes directly to the [storage layer](architecture/storage-layer.html) of the database.

For more information about importing data from Postgres, see [Migrate from Postgres](migrate-from-postgres.html).

For more information about importing data from MySQL, see [Migrate from MySQL](migrate-from-mysql.html).

### Use `rewriteBatchedInserts` for increased speed

We strongly recommend setting `rewriteBatchedInserts=true`; we have seen 2-3x performance improvements with it enabled. From [the JDBC connection parameters documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html#connection-parameters):

> This will change batch inserts from `insert into foo (col1, col2, col3) values (1,2,3)` into `insert into foo (col1, col2, col3) values (1,2,3), (4,5,6)` this provides 2-3x performance improvement

### Use a batch size of 128

PGJDBC's batching support only works with [powers of two](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/7b52b0c9e5b9aa9a9c655bb68f23bf4ec57fd51c/pgjdbc/src/main/java/org/postgresql/jdbc/PgPreparedStatement.java#L1597), and will split batches of other sizes up into multiple sub-batches. This means that a batch of size 128 can be 6x faster than a batch of size 250.

The code snippet below shows a pattern for using a batch size of 128, and is taken from the longer example above (specifically, the `BasicExampleDAO.bulkInsertRandomAccountData()` method).

Specifically, it does the following:

1. Turn off auto-commit so you can manage the transaction lifecycle and thus the size of the batch inserts.
2. Given an overall update size of 500 rows (for example), split it into batches of size 128 and execute each batch in turn.
3. Finally, commit the batches of statements you've just executed.

~~~ java
int BATCH_SIZE = 128;
connection.setAutoCommit(false);

try (PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO accounts (id, balance) VALUES (?, ?)")) {
    for (int i=0; i<=(500/BATCH_SIZE);i++) {
        for (int j=0; j<BATCH_SIZE; j++) {
            int id = random.nextInt(1000000000);
            int balance = random.nextInt(1000000000);
            pstmt.setInt(1, id);
            pstmt.setInt(2, balance);
            pstmt.addBatch();
        }
        int[] count = pstmt.executeBatch();
        System.out.printf("    => %s row(s) updated in this batch\n", count.length); // Verifying 128 rows in the batch
    }
    connection.commit();
}
~~~

### Retrieve large data sets in chunks using cursors

CockroachDB now supports the Postgres wire-protocol cursors for implicit transactions and explicit transactions executed to completion. This means the [PGJDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org) can use this protocol to stream queries with large result sets. This is much faster than [paginating through results in SQL using `LIMIT .. OFFSET`](selection-queries.html#paginate-through-limited-results).

For instructions showing how to use cursors in your Java code, see [Getting results based on a cursor](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/query.html#query-with-cursor) from the PGJDBC documentation.

Note that interleaved execution (partial execution of multiple statements within the same connection and transaction) is not supported when [`Statement.setFetchSize()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#setFetchSize-int-) is used.
