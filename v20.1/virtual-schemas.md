In addition to the `public` schema, CockroachDB supports a fixed set of virtual schemas, available in every database, that provide non-stored data to client applications.

The following virtual schemas are included with CockroachDB:

- `pg_catalog`, provided for compatibility with PostgreSQL.
- [`information_schema`](information-schema.html), provided for compatibility with the SQL standard.
- [`crdb_internal`](crdb-internal.html), provided for introspection into CockroachDB internals.

Tables in virtual schemas have varying levels of stability. Not all virtual schema tables are meant for programmatic purposes.
