This tutorial shows you how to build a simple [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application with CockroachDB, using the [MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter module](http://mybatis.org/spring-boot-starter) for data access.

## Before you begin

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/before-you-begin.md %}

## Step 1. Install JDK

Download and install a Java Development Kit. MyBatis-Spring supports Java versions 8+. In this tutorial, we use [JDK 11 from OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).

## Step 2. Install Gradle

This example application uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage all application dependencies. Spring supports Gradle versions 6+.

To install Gradle on macOS, run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ brew install gradle
~~~

To install Gradle on a Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ apt-get install gradle
~~~

To install Gradle on a Red Hat-based Linux distribution like Fedora:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ dnf install gradle
~~~

For other ways to install Gradle, see [its official documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html).

## Step 3. Get the application code

To get the application code, download or clone the [`mybatis-cockroach-demo` repository](https://github.com/jeffgbutler/mybatis-cockroach-demo).

## Step 4. Create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="secure">

Start the [built-in SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --certs-dir=certs
~~~

In the SQL shell, issue the following statements to create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS maxroach;
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE bank;
~~~

Give the `bank` user the necessary permissions:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> GRANT ALL ON DATABASE bank TO maxroach;
~~~

Exit the SQL shell:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~

## Step 5. Generate a certificate for the `maxroach` user

Create a certificate and key for the `maxroach` user by running the following command. The code samples will run as this user.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach cert create-client maxroach --certs-dir=certs --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key --also-generate-pkcs8-key
~~~

The [`--also-generate-pkcs8-key` flag](cockroach-cert.html#flag-pkcs8) generates a key in [PKCS#8 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208), which is the standard key encoding format in Java. In this case, the generated PKCS8 key will be named `client.maxroach.key.pk8`.

## Step 6. Run the application

To run the application:

1. Open and edit the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file so that the `url` field specifies the full [connection string](connection-parameters.html#connect-using-a-url) to the [running CockroachDB cluster](#before-you-begin). To connect to a secure cluster, this connection string must set the `sslmode` connection parameter to `require`, and specify the full path to the client, node, and user certificates in the connection parameters. For example:

      ~~~ yml
      ...
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:26257/bank?ssl=true&sslmode=require&sslrootcert=certs/ca.crt&sslkey=certs/client.maxroach.key.pk8&sslcert=certs/client.maxroach.crt
      ...
      ~~~
1. Open a terminal, and navigate to the `mybatis-cockroach-demo` project directory:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cd <path>/mybatis-cockroach-demo
    ~~~

1. Run the Gradle script to download the application dependencies, compile the code, and run the application:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./gradlew bootRun
    ~~~

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="insecure">

Start the [built-in SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure
~~~

In the SQL shell, issue the following statements to create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS maxroach;
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE bank;
~~~

Give the `bank` user the necessary permissions:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> GRANT ALL ON DATABASE bank TO maxroach;
~~~

Exit the SQL shell:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~

## Step 6. Run the application

To run the application:

1. Open and edit the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file so that the `url` field specifies the full [connection string](connection-parameters.html#connect-using-a-url) to the [running CockroachDB cluster](#before-you-begin). For example:

      ~~~ yaml
      ...
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:26257/bank?ssl=false
      ...
      ~~~
1. Open a terminal, and navigate to the `mybatis-cockroach-demo` project directory:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cd <path>/mybatis-cockroach-demo
    ~~~

1. Run the Gradle script to download the application dependencies, compile the code, and run the application:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./gradlew bootRun
    ~~~

</section>

The output should look like the following:

~~~

The application runs a number of test functions that result in reads and writes to the `accounts` table in the `bank` database.

For more details about the application code, see [Application details](#application-details).

## Application details

This section walks you through the different components of the application project in detail.

### Main process

The main process of the application is defined in `src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/CockroachDemoApplication.java`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/CockroachDemoApplication.java %}
~~~

The `SpringApplication.run` call in the `main` method bootstraps and launches a Spring application. The [`@SpringBootApplication` annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-using-springbootapplication-annotation) on the `CockroachDemoApplication` class triggers Spring's [component scanning](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-structuring-your-code) and [auto-configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-auto-configuration) features.

The `BasicExample` class, defined in `src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/BasicExample.java`, is one of the components detected in the component scan:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/BasicExample.java %}
~~~

`BasicExample` implements the [Spring `CommandLineRunner` interface](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-command-line-runner). Implementations of this interface automatically run when detected in a Spring project directory. `BasicExample` runs a series of test methods that are eventually executed as SQL queries in the [data access layer of the application](#mappers).

### Configuration

All [MyBatis-Spring](https://mybatis.org/spring/) applications need a [`DataSource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-configure-datasource), a [`SqlSessionFactory`](https://mybatis.org/spring/factorybean.html), and at least one [mapper interface](https://mybatis.org/spring/mappers.html). The [MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter](hhttps://mybatis.org/spring-boot-starter/mybatis-spring-boot-autoconfigure) module, built on [MyBatis](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/) and MyBatis-Spring, and used by this application, greatly simplifies how you configure each of these required elements.

Applications that use MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter typically need just an annotated mapper interface and an existing `DataSource` in the Spring environment. The module detects the `DataSource`, creates a `SqlSessionFactory` from the `DataSource`, creates a thread-safe [`SqlSessionTemplate`](https://mybatis.org/spring/sqlsession.html#SqlSessionTemplate) with the `SqlSessionFactory`, and then auto-scans the mappers and links them to the `SqlSessionTemplate` for injection. The `SqlSessionTemplate` automatically commits, rolls back, and closes sessions, based on the application's [Spring-based transaction configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction).

This sample application implements [batch write operations](insert.html#performance-best-practices), a CockroachDB best practice for executing multiple `INSERT` and `UPSERT` statements. MyBatis applications that support batch operations require some additional configuration work, even if the application uses MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter:

- The application must define a specific mapper interface for batch query methods.
- The application must define a `SqlSessionTemplate` constructor, specifically for batch operations, that uses the [`BATCH` executor type](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/apidocs/reference/org/apache/ibatis/executor/BatchExecutor.html).
- The batch mapper must be explicitly registered with the batch-specific `SqlSessionTemplate`.

The class defined in `src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/MyBatisConfiguration.java` configures the application to meet these requirements:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/MyBatisConfiguration.java %}
~~~

This class explicitly defines the batch `SqlSessionTemplate` (i.e., `batchSqlSessionTemplate`), and registers `batchmapper`, the batch mapper interface defined in [`src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/batchmapper/BatchMapper.java`](#mappers) with `batchSqlSessionTemplate`. To complete the MyBatis configuration, the class also declares a `DataSource`, and defines the remaining `SqlSessionFactory` and `SqlSessionTemplate` beans.

Note that a configuration class is not required for MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter applications that do not implement batch operations.

### Data source

`src/main/resources/application.yml` contains the metadata used to create a connection to the CockroachDB cluster:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ yaml
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/application.yml %}
~~~

Spring Boot uses the application's `datasource` property [to auto-configure the database connection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-configure-datasource). This database connection configuration can be injected into the application's `SqlSessionFactoryBean`, as is explicitly done in the [MyBatisConfiguration](#configuration) configuration class definition.

### Mappers

All MyBatis applications require at least one mapper interface. These mappers take the place of manually-defined data access objects (DAOs). They provide other layers of the application an interface to the database.

MyBatis-Spring-Boot-Starter usually scans the project for interfaces annotated with `@Mapper`, links the interfaces to a `SqlSessionTemplate`, and registers them with Spring so they can be [injected into the application's Spring beans](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection). As mentioned in the [Configuration section](#configuration), because the application supports batch writes, the two mapper interfaces in the application are registered and linked manually in the `MyBatisConfiguration` configuration class definition.

#### Account mapper

`src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/mapper/AccountMapper.java` defines the mapper interface to the `accounts` table using the [MyBatis Java API](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/java-api.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/mapper/AccountMapper.java %}
~~~

The `@Mapper` annotation declares the interface a mapper for MyBatis to scan. The SQL statement annotations on each of the interface methods map them to SQL queries. For example, the first method, `deleteAllAccounts()` is marked as a `DELETE` statement with the `@Delete` annotation. This method executes the SQL statement specified in the string passed to the annotation, "`delete from accounts`", which deletes all rows in the `accounts` table.

#### Batch account mapper

`src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/batchmapper/BatchAccountMapper.java` defines a mapper interface for [batch writes](insert.html#performance-best-practices):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/batchmapper/BatchAccountMapper.java %}
~~~

This interface has a single `INSERT` statement query method, along with a method for flushing (i.e., executing) a batch of statements.

### Services

`src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/service/AccountService.java` defines the service interface, with a number of methods for reading and writing to the database:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/service/AccountService.java %}
~~~

`MyBatisAccountService.java` implements the `AccountService` interface, using the mappers defined in [`AccountMapper.java` and `BatchAccountMapper.java`](#mappers), and the models defined in [`Account.java` and `BatchResults.java`](#models):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/service/MyBatisAccountService.java %}
~~~

Note that the public methods (i.e., the methods to be called by other classes in the project) are annotated as [`@Transactional`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative-annotations) methods. This ensures that all of the SQL statements executed in the data access layer are run within the context of a [database transaction](transactions.html)

`@Transactional` takes a number of parameters, including a `propagation` parameter that determines the transaction propagation behavior around an object (i.e., at what point in the stack a transaction starts and ends). `propagation=REQUIRES_NEW` for the methods in the service layer, meaning that a new transaction must be created each time a request is made to the service layer. With this propagation behavior, the application follows the [entity-control-boundary (ECB) pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-control-boundary), as the service boundaries determine where a [transaction](transactions.html) starts and ends rather than the lower-level query methods of the [mapper interfaces](#mappers).

For more details on aspect-oriented transaction management in this application, [see below](#transaction-management).

### Models

Instances of the `Account` class, defined in `src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/model/Account.java`, represent rows in the `accounts` table:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/model/Account.java %}
~~~

Instances of the `BatchResults` class, defined in `src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/model/BatchResults.java`, hold metadata about a batch write operation and its results:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/model/BatchResults.java %}
~~~

### Transaction management

MyBatis-Spring supports Spring's [declarative, aspect-oriented transaction management syntax](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative), including the [`@Transactional`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative-annotations) annotation and [AspectJ's AOP annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative-aspectj).

Transactions may require retries if they experience deadlock or [transaction contention](performance-best-practices-overview.html#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) that cannot be resolved without allowing [serialization](demo-serializable.html) anomalies. To handle transactions that are aborted due to transient serialization errors, we highly recommend writing [client-side transaction retry logic](transactions.html#client-side-intervention) into applications written on CockroachDB. In this application, transaction retry logic is written into the methods of the `RetryableTransactionAspect` class, defined in `src/main/java/com/example/cockroachdemo/RetryableTransactionAspect.java`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ java
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/spring-mybatis/RetryableTransactionAspect.java %}
~~~

The [`@Aspect` annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-at-aspectj) declares `RetryableTransactionAspect` an [aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_(computer_programming)), with [pointcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointcut) and [advice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_(programming)) methods.

#### Transactional pointcut

The [`@Pointcut` annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-pointcuts) declares the `anyTransactionBoundaryOperation` method the pointcut for determining when to execute the aspect's advice. The `@annotation` [designator](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-pointcuts-designators) passed to the `@Pointcut` annotation limits the matches (i.e., [join points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_point)) to method calls with a specific annotation, in this case, `@Transactional`.

#### Transaction retry advice

`retryableOperation` handles the application retry logic, with [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff), as the advice to execute at an `anyTransactionBoundaryOperation(transactional)` join point. Spring supports [several different annotations to declare advice](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-advice). The [`@Around` annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-ataspectj-around-advice) allows an advice method to work before and after the join point. It also gives the advice method control over executing any other matching advisors.

`retryableOperation` first verifies that there is no active transaction. It then increments the retry count and attempts to proceed to the next advice method with the `ProceedingJoinPoint.proceed()` method. If the underlying data access layer method (i.e., the mapper interface method annotated with `@Transactional`) succeeds, the results are returned and the application flow continues. If the method fails, then the transaction is retried. The time between each retry grows with each retry until the maximum number of retries is reached.

#### Advice ordering

Spring automatically adds [transaction management advice](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#tx-decl-explained) to all methods annotated with `@Transactional`. Because the pointcut for `RetryableTransactionAspect` also matches methods annotated with `@Transactional`, there will always be two advisors that match the same pointcut. When multiple advisors match at the same pointcut, an `@Order` annotation on an advisor's aspect can specify the order in which the advice should be evaluated.

To control when and how often a transaction is retried, the transaction retry advice must be executed outside the context of a transaction (i.e., it must be evaluated before the primary transaction management advisor). By default, the primary transaction management advisor is given the lowest level of precedence. The `@Order` annotation on `RetryableTransactionAspect` is passed `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE-1`, which places this aspect's advice at a level of precedence above the primary transaction advisor, which results in the retry logic being evaluated before the transaction management advisor.

For more details about advice ordering in Spring, see [Advice Ordering](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-ataspectj-advice-ordering) on the Spring documentation site.
