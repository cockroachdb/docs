title: information_schema
summary: The information_schema virtual schema contains read-only views that you can use for introspection into your database's tables, columns, indexes, and views.
toc: true
---

CockroachDB provides a [virtual schema](virtual-schemas.html) called `information_schema` that contains information about your database's tables, columns, indexes, and views. This information can be used for introspection and reflection.

The definition of `information_schema` is part of the SQL standard and can therefore be relied on to remain stable over time. This contrasts with CockroachDB's `SHOW` statements, which provide similar data and are meant to be stable in CockroachDB but not standardized. It also contrasts with the virtual schema [`crdb_internal`](crdb-internal.html), which reflects the internals of CockroachDB and may thus change across CockroachDB versions.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The `information_schema` views typically represent objects that the current user has privilege to access. To ensure you can view all the objects in a database, access it as the `root` user.

## Data exposed by `information_schema`

To perform introspection on objects, you can either read from the related `information_schema` table or use one of CockroachDB's `SHOW` statements.

Object | `information_schema` Table | Corresponding `SHOW` Statement
-------|--------------|--------
Columns | [`columns`](#columns) | [`SHOW COLUMNS`](show-columns.html)
Constraints | [`check_constraints`](#check_constraints), [`key_column_usage`](#key_column_usage), [`referential_constraints`](#referential_constraints), [`table_constraints`](#table_constraints)| [`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`](show-constraints.html)

## Tables in `information_schema`

The virtual schema `information_schema` contains virtual tables, also called "system views," representing the database's objects, each of which is detailed below.

These differ from regular [SQL views](views.html) in that they are
not showing data created from the content of other tables. Instead,
CockroachDB generates the data for virtual tables when they are accessed.

Currently, there are some `information_schema` tables that are empty but provided for compatibility:

- `routines`
- `parameters`

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
A query can specify a table name without a database name (e.g., `SELECT * FROM information_schema.sequences`). See [Name Resolution](sql-name-resolution.html) for more information.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The virtual tables in `information_schema` contain useful comments with links to further documentation. To view these comments, use `SHOW TABLES FROM information_schema WITH COMMENT`:
{{site.data.alerts.end}}
