title: Common Table Expressions
summary: Common Table Expressions (CTEs) simplify the definition and use of subqueries
toc: true
toc_not_nested: true
---

Common Table Expressions, or CTEs, provide a shorthand name to a
possibly complex [subquery](subqueries.html) before it is used in a
larger query context. This improves readability of the SQL code.

CTEs can be used in combination with [`SELECT`
clauses](select-clause.html) and [`INSERT`](insert.html),
[`DELETE`](delete.html), [`UPDATE`](update.html) and
[`UPSERT`](upsert.html) statements.

## Overview

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The examples on this page use MovR, a fictional vehicle-sharing application, to demonstrate CockroachDB SQL statements. To follow along, run [`cockroach demo`](cockroach-demo.html) from the command line to start a temporary, in-memory cluster with the `movr` dataset preloaded.

For more information about the MovR example application and dataset, see [MovR: A Global Vehicle-sharing App](movr.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

A query or statement of the form `WITH x AS y IN z` creates the
temporary table name `x` for the results of the subquery `y`, to be
reused in the context of the query `z`.

For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> WITH r AS (SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 98)
  SELECT * FROM users AS u, r WHERE r.rider_id = u.id;
~~~

~~~
                   id                  |     city      |       name       |            address             | credit_card |                  id                  |     city      | vehicle_city  |               rider_id               |              vehicle_id              |           start_address           |        end_address        |        start_time         |         end_time          | revenue

In this example, the `WITH` clause defines the temporary name `r` for
the subquery over `rides`, and that name becomes a valid table name
for use in any [table expression](table-expressions.html) of the
subsequent `SELECT` clause.

This query is equivalent to, but arguably simpler to read than:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM users AS u, (SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 98) AS r
  WHERE r.rider_id = u.id;
~~~

It is also possible to define multiple common table expressions
simultaneously with a single `WITH` clause, separated by commas. Later
subqueries can refer to earlier subqueries by name. For example, the
following query is equivalent to the two examples above:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> WITH r AS (SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 98),
	results AS (SELECT * FROM users AS u, r WHERE r.rider_id = u.id)
  SELECT * FROM results;
~~~

In this example, the second CTE `results` refers to the first CTE `r`
by name. The final query refers to the CTE `results`.

## Nested `WITH` clauses

It is possible to use a `WITH` clause in a subquery, or even a `WITH` clause within another `WITH` clause. For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> WITH u AS
	(SELECT * FROM
		(WITH u_tab AS (SELECT * FROM users) SELECT * FROM u_tab))
  SELECT * FROM u;
~~~

When analyzing [table expressions](table-expressions.html) that
mention a CTE name, CockroachDB will choose the CTE definition that is
closest to the table expression. For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> WITH
  u AS (SELECT * FROM users),
  v AS (WITH u AS (SELECT * from vehicles) SELECT * FROM u)
	SELECT * FROM v;
~~~

In this example, the inner subquery `SELECT * FROM v` will select from
table `vehicles` (closest `WITH` clause), not from table `users`.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
<span class="version-tag">New in v20.1:</span> CockroachDB does not support nested `WITH` clauses containing [data-modifying statements](#data-modifying-statements). `WITH` clauses containing data-modifying statements must be at the top level of the query.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Data-modifying statements

It is possible to use a [data-modifying statement](sql-statements.html#data-manipulation-statements) (`INSERT`, `DELETE`,
etc.) as a common table expression, as long as the `WITH` clause containing the data-modifying statement is at the top level of the query.

For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> WITH final_code AS
  (INSERT INTO promo_codes(code, description, rules)
  VALUES ('half_off', 'Half-price ride!', '{"type": "percent_discount", "value": "50%"}'), ('free_ride', 'Free ride!', '{"type": "percent_discount", "value": "100%"}')
  returning rules)
  SELECT rules FROM final_code;
~~~

~~~
                      rules
+-----------------------------------------------+
  {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "50%"}
  {"type": "percent_discount", "value": "100%"}
(2 rows)
~~~

If the `WITH` clause containing the data-modifying statement is at a lower level, the statement results in an error:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT (WITH final_code AS
  (INSERT INTO promo_codes(code, description, rules)
  VALUES ('half_off', 'Half-price ride!', '{"type": "percent_discount", "value": "50%"}'), ('free_ride', 'Free ride!', '{"type": "percent_discount", "value": "100%"}')
  returning rules)
  SELECT rules FROM final_code);
~~~

~~~
ERROR: WITH clause containing a data-modifying statement must be at the top level
SQLSTATE: 0A000
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If a common table expression contains
a data-modifying statement (<code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>,
etc.), the modifications are performed fully even if only part
of the results are used, e.g., with <a
href="limit-offset.html"><code>LIMIT</code></a>. See <a
href="subqueries.html#data-writes-in-subqueries">Data
Writes in Subqueries</a> for details.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Reusing common table expressions

You can reference a CTE multiple times in a single query, using a `WITH` operator.

For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> WITH
    users_ny AS (SELECT name, id FROM users WHERE city='new york'),
    vehicles_ny AS (SELECT type, id, owner_id FROM vehicles WHERE city='new york')
    SELECT * FROM users_ny JOIN vehicles_ny ON users_ny.id = vehicles_ny.owner_id;
~~~

~~~
        name       |                  id                  |    type    |                  id                  |               owner_id

In this single query, you define two CTE's and then reuse them in a table join.

## Recursive common table expressions

<span class="version-tag">New in v20.1:</span> CockroachDB supports [recursive common table expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_and_recursive_queries_in_SQL#Common_table_expression). Recursive common table expressions are common table expressions that contain subqueries that refer to their own output.

Recursive CTE definitions take the following form:

~~~ sql
WITH RECURSIVE <cte name> (<columns>) AS (
    <initial subquery>
  UNION ALL
    <recursive subquery>
)
<query>
~~~

To write a recursive CTE:

1. Add the `RECURSIVE` keyword directly after the `WITH` operator in the CTE definition, and before the CTE name.
1. Define an initial, non-recursive subquery. This subquery defines the initial values of the CTE.
1. Add the `UNION ALL` keyword after the initial subquery.
1. Define a recursive subquery that references its own output. This subquery can also reference the CTE name, unlike the initial subquery.
1. Write a parent query that evaluates the results of the CTE.

CockroachDB evaluates recursive CTEs as follows:

1. The initial query is evaluated. Its results are stored to rows in the CTE and copied to a temporary, working table. This working table is updated across iterations of the recursive subquery.
1. The recursive subquery is evaluated iteratively on the contents of the working table. The results of each iteration replace the contents of the working table. The results are also stored to rows of the CTE. The recursive subquery iterates until no results are returned.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Recursive subqueries must eventually return no results, or the query will run indefinitely.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For example, the following recursive CTE calculates the factorial of the numbers 0 through 9:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n, factorial) AS (
    VALUES (0, 1) -- initial subquery
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1, (n+1)*factorial FROM cte WHERE n < 9 -- recursive subquery
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
~~~

~~~
  n | factorial
+---+-----------+
  0 |         1
  1 |         1
  2 |         2
  3 |         6
  4 |        24
  5 |       120
  6 |       720
  7 |      5040
  8 |     40320
  9 |    362880
(10 rows)
~~~

The initial subquery (`VALUES (0, 1)`) initializes the working table with the values `0` for the `n` column and `1` for the `factorial` column. The recursive subquery (`SELECT n+1, (n+1)*factorial FROM cte WHERE n < 9`) evaluates over the initial values of the working table and replaces its contents with the results. It then iterates over the contents of the working table, replacing its contents at each iteration, until `n` reaches `9`, when the [`WHERE` clause](select-clause.html#filter-rows) evaluates as false.

If no `WHERE` clause were defined in the example, the recursive subquery would always return results and loop indefinitely, resulting in an error:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n, factorial) AS (
    VALUES (0, 1) -- initial subquery
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1, (n+1)*factorial FROM cte -- recursive subquery with no WHERE clause
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
~~~

~~~
ERROR: integer out of range
SQLSTATE: 22003
~~~

If you are unsure if your recursive subquery will loop indefinitely, you can limit the results of the CTE with the [`LIMIT`](limit-offset.html) keyword.

For example, if we remove the `WHERE` clause from the factorial example, we can use `LIMIT` to limit the results and avoid the `integer out of range` error:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte (n, factorial) AS (
    VALUES (0, 1) -- initial subquery
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1, (n+1)*factorial FROM cte -- recursive subquery
)
SELECT * FROM cte LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
  n | factorial
+---+-----------+
  0 |         1
  1 |         1
  2 |         2
  3 |         6
  4 |        24
  5 |       120
  6 |       720
  7 |      5040
  8 |     40320
  9 |    362880
(10 rows)
~~~

While this practice works for testing and debugging, we do not recommend it in production.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
CockroachDB does not currently support the [Postgres recursive CTE variant](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/queries-with.html) with the keyword `UNION`.
