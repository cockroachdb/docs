While you manage your schema, data, and users yourself, for any of the following cluster management tasks, please reach out to Cockroach Labs at [support.cockroachlabs.com](https://support.cockroachlabs.com) and a member of our team will assist you:

- Adding or removing nodes
- Restoring data from a backup
- Adjusting your cluster firewall to allow or disallow connections for specific IPs

Also, although you can leverage [geo-partitioning](partitioning.html), advanced [replication controls](configure-replication-zones.html), and [CDC](change-data-capture.html) without intervention from Cockroach Labs, we recommend reaching out for initial guidance and best practices.
