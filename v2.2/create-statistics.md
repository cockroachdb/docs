title: CREATE STATISTICS
summary: Use the CREATE STATISTICS statement to generate table statistics for the cost-based optimizer to use.
toc: true
---
Use the `CREATE STATISTICS` [statement](sql-statements.html) to generate table statistics for the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html) to use.

Once you [create a table](create-table.html) and load data into it (e.g., [`INSERT`](insert.html), [`IMPORT`](import.html)), table statistics can be generated. Table statistics help the cost-based optimizer determine the cardinality of the rows used in each query, which helps to predict more accurate costs.

## Synopsis

| `statistics_name`     | The name of the set of statistics you are creating.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `opt_stats_columns`   | The name of the column(s) you want to create statistics for.                                                                                                                                          |

| `opt_as_of_clause`    | Used to create historical stats using the [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](as-of-system-time.html) clause.  For instructions, see [Create statistics as of a given time](#create-statistics-as-of-a-given-time). |

## Examples

### Automatic table statistics

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/automatic-statistics.md %}

### Create statistics on a specific column

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE STATISTICS students ON id FROM students_by_list;
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Multi-column statistics are not supported yet.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Create statistics on a default set of columns

The `CREATE STATISTICS` statement shown below automatically figures out which columns to get statistics on &mdash; specifically, it chooses columns which are part of the primary key and/or an index.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE STATISTICS students FROM students_by_list;
~~~

### Create statistics as of a given time

To create statistics as of a given time (in this example, 1 minute ago to avoid interfering with the production workload), run a statement like the following:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE STATISTICS employee_stats FROM employees AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-1m';
~~~

For more information about how the `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clause works, including supported time formats, see [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](as-of-system-time.html).

### Delete statistics
