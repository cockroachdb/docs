### New Features

- `EXPLAIN` can now be used with `CREATE`, `DROP`, and `ALTER` statements. [#7269](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7269)
- The command-line SQL client now prints tab-separated values instead of ASCII-art tables when `stdout` is not a TTY (unless `--pretty` is used). [#7268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7268)
- In interactive mode, the command-line SQL client now prints the number of rows at the end of a result set. [#7266](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7266)
- The web UI has been rewritten in a new framework. [#7242](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7242)
- Prepared statements can now be deallocated with the `DEALLOCATE` command. [#7367](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7367)

### Performance Improvements

- The load balancing system now operates at a steadier pace, reducing spikes in memory usage and reaching equilibrium more quickly. [#7147](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7147)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash when session arguments could not be parsed. [#7231](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7231)
- Improved error messages for parts of the PostgreSQL protocol we do not support. [#7233](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7233)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` can now be used in prepared statements. [#7251](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7251)
- Raft messages are no longer canceled due to unrelated errors. [#7252](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7252)
- Constraint names that are specified at the column level are now preserved. [#7271](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7271)
- When `COMMIT` returns an error, the transaction is considered closed and a separate `ROLLBACK` is no longer necessary. [#7282](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7282)
- The command-line SQL client now escapes strings in a format that the SQL parser will accept. [#7294](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7294)
- Fixed issues when two snapshots were being sent simultaneously. [#7299](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7299)
- When a column is renamed, any `CHECK` constraints referring to that column are now updated. [#7311](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7311)
- When piping commands into the command-line SQL client, the last line was previously ignored. Now it will be executed if it ends with a semicolon, or report an error if it is non-empty but not a complete statement. [#7328](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7328)
