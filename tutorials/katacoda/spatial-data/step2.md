You live in New York City and are an avid birdwatcher and reader of books. You are going on a vacation up to the [Adirondack Mountains](https://visitadirondacks.com/about) in northern New York State. Although you are interested in many bird species, you are most interested in seeing (and [hearing](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/107964)) the [Common Loon](https://ebird.org/species/comloo), a bird that can be found near the lakes and ponds of the north woods.

As a connoisseur of bookstores, you also want to make sure to visit as many of the local independent bookstores as possible on your trip, as long as they are nearby to Loon habitat.

Therefore, in order to plan your vacation trip effectively and optimize for having the most fun, you want to make sure to visit:

+ Loon habitat (at minimum -- ideally you would like to go on the "hunt" for other interesting bird species).
+ Independent bookstores that are located within the approximate home range of the loon.

To accomplish the above, you have put together a data set that consists of what are normally several different data sets, namely:

+ NY State bird sighting data from the years 2000-2019, taken from the [North American Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS)](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/52b1dfa8e4b0d9b325230cd9). The full survey covers the US and Canada from the years 1966-2019 and is very large, so you have decided to import just the recent NY data since that is all you need to plan your trip.

+ Road data from the [US National Atlas - Major Roads of the United States](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/581d052be4b08da350d524ce) data set. This consists of a full road map of the United States. It was last modified in 2016, so it should be reasonably accurate.

+ Bookstore information (name, address, website, etc.) you scraped from the [American Booksellers Association website's member directory](https://bookweb.org/member_directory/search/ABAmember).

For more information about how this data set is put together, see the [Data set description](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/spatial-tutorial.html#data-set-description).
