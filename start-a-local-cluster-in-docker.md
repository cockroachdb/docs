Once you've [installed the official CockroachDB Docker image](install-cockroachdb.html), it's simple to run a multi-node cluster across multiple Docker containers on a single host, using Docker volumes to persist node data.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}Running multiple nodes on a single host is useful for testing out CockroachDB, but it's not recommended for production deployments. To run a physically distributed cluster in production, see <a href="manual-deployment.html">Manual Deployment</a>, <a href="cloud-deployment.html">Cloud Deployment</a>, or <a href="orchestration.html">Orchestration</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have already:

- Installed and started Docker
- Pulled the official CockroachDB image from Docker Hub

For full details, go to [Install CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html) and choose **Use Docker** for your OS. 

## Step 1. Create a bridge network

Since you'll be running multiple Docker containers on a single host, with one CockroachDB node per container, you need to create what Docker refers to as a [bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/#/a-bridge-network). The bridge network will enable the containers to communicate as a single cluster while keeping them isolated from external networks. 

~~~ shell
$ docker network create -d bridge roachnet
~~~

We've used `roachnet` as the network name here and in subsequent steps, but feel free to give your network any name you like.

## Step 2. Start your first container/node

~~~ shell
$ docker run -d \
--name=roach1 \
--hostname=roach1 \
--net=roachnet \
-p 26257:26257 -p 8080:8080  \
-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach1:/cockroach/cockroach-data"  \
cockroachdb/cockroach:{{site.data.strings.version}} start --insecure
~~~

This command creates a container and starts the first CockroachDB node inside it. Let's look at each part:

- `docker run`: The Docker command to start a new container.
- `-d`: This flag runs the container in the background so you can continue the next steps in the same shell. 
- `--name`: The name for the container. This is optional, but a custom name makes it significantly easier to reference the container in other commands, for example, when opening a Bash session in the container or stopping the container. 
- `--hostname`: The hostname for the container. You will use this to join other containers/nodes to the cluster.
- `--net`: The bridge network for the container to join. See step 1 for more details.
- `-p 26257:26257 -p 8080:8080`: These flags map the default port for inter-node and client-node communication (`26257`) and the default port of HTTP requests from the Admin UI (`8080`) from the container to the host. This enables inter-container communication and makes it possible to call up the Admin UI from a browser.
- `-v ${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach1:/cockroach/cockroach-data`: This flag mounts a host directory as a data volume. This means that data and logs for this node will be stored in `${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach1` on the host and will persist after the container is stopped or deleted. For more details about volumes, see Docker's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/">Manage data in containers</a> topic.
- `cockroachdb/cockroach:{{site.data.strings.version}} start --insecure`: The CockroachDB command to [start a node](start-a-node.html) in the container in insecure mode. 

  {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}By default, each node's cache is limited to 25% of available memory. This default is reasonable when running one container/node per host. When running multiple containers/nodes on a single host, however, it may lead to out of memory errors, especially when testing against the cluster in a serious way. To avoid such errors, you can manually limit each node's cache size by setting the <a href="start-a-node.html#flags"><code>--cache</code></a> flag in the <code>start</code> command.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 3. Start additional containers/nodes

~~~ shell
# Start the second container/node:
$ docker run -d \
--name=roach2 \
--hostname=roach2 \
--net=roachnet \
-P \
-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach2:/cockroach/cockroach-data" \
cockroachdb/cockroach:{{site.data.strings.version}} start --insecure --join=roach1

# Start the third container/node:
$ docker run -d \
--name=roach3 \
--hostname=roach3 \
--net=roachnet \
-P \
-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach3:/cockroach/cockroach-data" \
cockroachdb/cockroach:{{site.data.strings.version}} start --insecure --join=roach1
~~~

These commands add two more containers and start CockroachDB nodes inside them, joining them to the first node. There are only a few differences to note from step 2:

- `-P`: This flag maps exposed ports to random ports on the host. This random mapping is fine since we've already mapped the relevant ports for the first container.
- `-v`: This flag mounts a host directory as a data volume. Data and logs for these nodes will be stored in `${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach2` and `${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach3` on the host and will persist after the containers are stopped or deleted.
- `--join`: This flag joins the new nodes to the cluster, using the first container's `hostname`. Otherwise, all [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) defaults are accepted. Note that since each node is in a unique container, using identical default ports wonâ€™t cause conflicts.

## Step 4. Use the built-in SQL client

Use the `docker exec` command to start a Bash session in the first container:

~~~ shell
$ docker exec -it roach1 bash
~~~

Start the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) in interactive mode:

~~~ shell
root@roach1:/cockroach# ./cockroach sql --insecure
# Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit: CTRL + D.
~~~

Then run some [CockroachDB SQL statements](learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE bank;
~~~

~~~
CREATE DATABASE
~~~

~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE bank.accounts (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance DECIMAL);
~~~

~~~
CREATE TABLE
~~~

~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO bank.accounts VALUES (1, 1000.50);
~~~

~~~
INSERT 1
~~~

~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |  1000.5 |
+----+---------+
(1 row)
~~~

When you're done, use **CTRL + D**, **CTRL + C**, or `\q` to exit the SQL shell. Then use **CTRL + D** to exit the Bash session.

If you want to verify that the containers/nodes are, in fact, part of a single cluster, you can start a Bash session in one of the other containers, start the SQL client in interactive mode, and check for the new `bank` database:

~~~ shell
$ docker exec -it roach2 bash
root@roach1:/cockroach# ./cockroach sql --insecure
# Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit: CTRL + D.
~~~

~~~ sql
> SHOW DATABASES;
~~~

~~~
+----------+
| Database |
+----------+
| bank     |
| system   |
+----------+
~~~

## Step 5. Open the Admin UI

When you started the first container/node, you mapped the node's default HTTP port `8080` to port `8080` on the host. To check out the [Admin UI](explore-the-admin-ui.html) for your cluster, point your browser to that port on `localhost`, i.e., `http://localhost:8080`.

## Step 6.  Stop the cluster

Once you're done looking through the Admin UI, you can stop the nodes (and therefore the cluster):

~~~ shell
# Stop node 1:
$ cockroach quit

# Stop node 2:
$ cockroach quit --port=26258

# Stop node 3:
$ cockroach quit --port=26259
~~~

For more details about the `cockroach quit` command, see [Stop a Node](stop-a-node.html).
