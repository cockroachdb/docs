This page describes the **Backups** page and how to restore your data.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Currently, the **Backups** page is only available for CockroachCloud clusters running on AWS. This page will be available for GCP clusters soon.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Cockroach Labs runs [full backups](../v20.1/backup.html#full-backups) daily and [incremental backups](../v20.1/backup.html#incremental-backups) hourly for every CockroachCloud cluster. The full backups are retained for 30 days, while incremental backups are retained for 7 days.

The backups that Cockroach Labs runs for you can be viewed on the [Backups page](#backups-page), where you can:

- [Restore a cluster](#restore-a-cluster)
- [Restore a database](#restore-a-database)
- [Restore a table](#restore-a-table)

You can also:

- [Back up from a self-hosted CockroachDB cluster and restore into a CockroachCloud cluster](#back-up-a-self-hosted-cockroachdb-cluster-and-restore-into-a-cockroachcloud-cluster)
- [Back up and restore data manually](#back-up-and-restore-data-manually)

## Backups page

A list of your full cluster backups displays on your cluster's **Backups** page.

For each backup, the following details display:

- The date and time the backup was taken (**Data From**)
- The **Status** of the backup
- The **Type** of backup
- The **Size** of the backup
- The remaining number of days the backup will be retained (**Expires In**)
- The number of [**Databases**](#databases) included in the backup

    To view the databases included in the backup, click the number in the [**Databases**](#databases) column.

<!-- - Additional **Recovery Info**. -->

You can [restore these clusters](#restore-a-cluster).

<!--To view additional details or [to restore a cluster](#restore-a-cluster), click **View** in the **Recovery Info** column. -->

### Databases

To view the databases included in the backup, click the number in the **Databases** column on the cluster view of the **Backups** page.

For each database in the backup, the following details display:

- The **Size** of the database data captured in the backup

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    If the **Size** listed for a database in an incremental backup is **0.00 B**, it means no changes were made in the database since the last full backup.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- The number of [**Tables**](#tables) in the database

    To view the tables in the database, click the number in the [**Tables**](#tables) column.

## Restore a cluster

To restore a cluster:

1. Using your cluster's **Backup** page, note the backup you want to use (**Data From**).

1. [Contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/hc/en-us) for the path to the backup.

1. [Restore each database](#restore-a-database).

1. [Configure replication zones](../v20.1/configure-replication-zones.html).

1. If you are restoring to a new cluster, configure the [cluster settings](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html).

1. If you are restoring to a new cluster, [create users and roles](../v20.1/create-role.html), and [grant privileges](../v20.1/grant.html).

1. If applicable, [add comments](../v20.1/comment-on.html) to databases and tables.

<!--
1. Click **View** for the cluster backup you want to restore.

    The **Recovery information** module displays.

1. Verify that you have enough space to restore the backup file.

    For daily backups, you need at least the space listed in the **Size** field above. For hourly backups, you need the **Size** plus the **Daily backup size**.

1. Verify that the target cluster does not have any user-created databases or tables. If you do not have a fresh cluster, `CREATE` a new one.

1. Copy the populated `RESTORE` statement.

1. In your command line interface, run the `RESTORE` statement. -->

## Restore a database

To restore a database:

<!-- 1. Find the cluster backup containing the database you want to restore, and click the number in the corresponding **Databases** column.

    The Databases view displays.

1. Click **View** for the database you want to restore.

    The **Recovery information** module displays. -->

1. Using your cluster's **Backup** page, note the backup you want to use (**Data From**).

1. [Contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/hc/en-us) for the path to the backup.

1. Verify that the name of the database you want to restore is not already in use in the target cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW DATABASES;
    ~~~

1. If the database's name is already in use, either:

    [Drop the existing database](../v20.1/drop-database.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > DROP DATABASE example_database;
    ~~~

    Or [change the existing database's name](../v20.1/rename-database.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER DATABASE example_database RENAME TO archived_example_database;
    ~~~

1. [Restore](../v20.1/restore.html) the database to the target cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > RESTORE DATABASE example_database FROM 'path_to_backup';
    ~~~

1. Set any database-specific [zone configurations](../v20.1/configure-replication-zones.html).

1. If applicable, [grant privileges](../v20.1/grant.html).

## Restore a table

To restore a table:

<!-- 1.  Find the cluster backup containing the table you want to restore, and click the number in the corresponding **Databases** column.

1. Verify that the name of the table you want to restore is not already in use in the target database:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW TABLES FROM example_database;
    ~~~

1. If the table's name is already in use, either:

    [Drop the existing table](../v20.1/drop-table.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > DROP TABLE example_table;
    ~~~

    Or [change the existing table's name](../v20.1/rename-table.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER TABLE example_database.example_table RENAME TO example_database.archived_example_table;
    ~~~

    You can also restore to a different database by changing the target database name:

    ~~~ sql
    > RESTORE TABLE example_database.example_table FROM 'path_to_backup' WITH into_db = 'new_target_database';
    ~~~

1. [Restore](../v20.1/restore.html) the table to the target cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}

## Back up a self-hosted CockroachDB cluster and restore into a CockroachCloud cluster

To back up a self-hosted CockroachDB cluster into a CockroachCloud cluster:

1. While [connected to your self-hosted CockroachDB cluster](../v20.1/connect-to-the-database.html), [back up](../v20.1/backup.html) your databases and/or tables to an [external location](../v20.1/backup.html#backup-file-urls):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > BACKUP DATABASE example_database TO 'gs://bucket_name/path_to_backup?AUTH=specified';
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
    If you are backing up the data to AWS or GCP, use the `specified` option for the `AUTH` parameter.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. [Connect to your CockroachCloud cluster](connect-to-your-cluster.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --url='postgres://<username>:<password>@<global host>:26257/<database>?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=<path to the CA certificate>'
    ~~~

1. [Restore](../v20.1/restore.html) to your CockroachCloud cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
