title: Use the Cloud API
summary: The Cloud API is used to manage clusters within an organization
toc: true
---

The Cloud API is a [REST interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that allows users programmatic access to manage the lifecycle of clusters within their organization.

{% include_cached cockroachcloud/experimental-warning.md %}

## API reference

Refer to the [full API reference documentation](../api/cloud/v1.html) for detailed descriptions of the API endpoints and options.

## Call the API

The API uses [bearer token authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and each request requires a [secret key](console-access-management.html#api-access). The secret key is associated with a service account, and inherits the [permissions of the account](console-access-management.html#service-accounts).

To send the secret key when making an API call, add the secret key to the `Authorization` HTTP header sent with the request.

    <button class="filter-button page-level" data-scope="raw"><strong>Raw</strong></button>
</div>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="curl">
{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell

~~~
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="raw">

~~~ text
Authorization: Bearer {secret key}
~~~
</section>

Where `{secret key}` is the [secret key string you stored when you created the API key in the Console](console-access-management.html#create-api-keys).

## Create a new cluster

To create a cluster, send a `POST` request to the `/v1/clusters` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `CREATE` permission to create new clusters.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {secret key}' \
  --data '{"name":"{cluster name}","provider":"{cloud provider}","serverless":{"regions":["{region name}"],"spendLimit":{spend limit}}}'

  "serverless": {
    "regions": [
      "{region name}"
    ],

  }
}
~~~
</section>

Where:

  - `{cluster name}` is the name of the cluster. This should be a short string with no whitespace.
  - `{cloud provider}` is the name of the cloud infrastructure provider on which you want your cluster to run. Possible values are: `GCP` and `AWS`.
  - `{region name}` is the zone code of the cloud infrastructure provider. For example, on GCP you can set the "us-west2" zone code.
  - `{spend limit}` is the [maximum amount of money, in US cents, you want to spend per month](serverless-cluster-management.html#planning-your-cluster) on this cluster.

For example, to create a new free Serverless cluster named "notorious-moose" using the default values for the cloud infrastructure provider and region:

{
  "name": "notorious-moose",

## Retrieve information about a specific cluster

To retrieve detailed information about a specific cluster, make a `GET` request to the `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `READ` permission to retrieve information about an organization's clusters.

  {{site.data.alerts.end}}
  - `{secret key}` is the secret key for the service account.

## Set the maximum spend limit of a Serverless cluster

## Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster, send a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `DELETE` permission to delete an organization's clusters.

Deleting a cluster will permanently delete the cluster and all the data within the cluster.
