title: Use the Cloud API
summary: The Cloud API is used to manage clusters within an organization
toc: true
docs_area: manage
---

The Cloud API is a [REST interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that allows you programmatic access to manage the lifecycle of clusters within your organization.

## API reference

Refer to the [full API reference documentation](../api/cloud/v1.html) for detailed descriptions of the API endpoints and options.

## Call the API

The API uses [bearer token authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and each request requires a [secret key](console-access-management.html#api-access). The secret key is associated with a service account, and inherits the [permissions of the account](console-access-management.html#service-accounts).

To send the secret key when making an API call, add the secret key to the `Authorization` HTTP header sent with the request.

</section>

Where `{secret_key}` is the [secret key string you stored when you created the API key in the Console](console-access-management.html#create-api-keys).

## Set the API version

The `Cc-Version` HTTP header specifies the version of the Cloud API to use. If you omit the `Cc-Version` header, the Cloud API will default to version `2022-03-31` (the initial release of the Cloud API). The Cloud API uses date-based versions of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`, in [ISO 8601 format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).

If you set an invalid version, you will get an HTTP 400 response with the message "invalid Cc-Version."

## Create a new cluster

To create a cluster, send a `POST` request to the `/v1/clusters` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `CREATE` [permission](console-access-management.html#service-accounts) to create new clusters.

## Set the maximum spend limit of a Serverless cluster

To set the maximum spend limit for a Serverless cluster, send a `PUT` request to the `/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/spend-limit` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `EDIT` [permission](console-access-management.html#service-accounts) to retrieve information about an organization's clusters.

## Export Cloud Organization audit logs

{% include feature-phases/preview-opt-in.md %}

To export audit logs for activities and events related to your Cloud organization, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/auditlogevents` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` [permission](console-access-management.html#service-accounts).

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/auditlogevents?starting_from={timestamp}&sort_order={sort_order}&limit={limit}' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}' \
  --header 'Cc-Version: {api_version}'
~~~

Where:

  - `{timestamp}` is an [RFC3339 timestamp](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) that indicates the first log entry to fetch. If unspecified, defaults to the time when the Cloud organization was created if `{sort_order}` is `ASC`, or the current time if `{sort_order}` is `DESC`.
  - `{sort_order}` is either `ASC` (the default) or `DESC`.
  - `{limit}` indicates roughly how many entries to return. If any entries would be returned for a timestamp, all entries for that timestamp are always returned. Defaults to `200`.
  - `{api_version}` is the [Cloud API version](#set-the-api-version).

A request that includes no parameters exports roughly 200 entries in ascending order, starting from when your {{ site.data.products.db }} organization was created.

If the request was successful, the client will receive a JSON array consisting of a list of log `entries` and, depending on the circumstances, a `next_starting_from` field.

- If `{sort_order}` is `ASC`, `next_starting_from` is always returned.
- If `{sort_order}` is `DESC`, then `next_starting_from` is returned as long as earlier audit logs are available. It is not returned when the earliest log entry is reached (when the {{ site.data.products.db }} organization was created).


{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ json
{
  "entries": [
    "{entry_array}"
  ],
  "next_starting_from": "{timestamp}"
}
~~~

Where:

  - `{entry_array}` is a structured JSON array of audit log entries.
  - `{timestamp}` indicates the timestamp to send to export the next batch of results.

## List all clusters in an organization

To list all active clusters within an organization, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/clusters` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `READ` [permission](console-access-management.html#service-accounts) to list an organization's clusters.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
