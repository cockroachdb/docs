title: Use the Cloud API
summary: The Cloud API is used to manage clusters within an organization
toc: true
---

The Cloud API is a [REST interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that allows users programmatic access to manage the lifecycle of clusters within their organization.

## API reference

Refer to the [full API reference documentation](../api/cloud/v1.html) for detailed descriptions of the API endpoints and options.

{%comment %} START of temporary content while API is still behind a feature-flag{% endcomment %}
## Service accounts

Service accounts are used by applications accessing the [API](cloud-api.html) to manage {{ site.data.products.db }} clusters within the organization. Service accounts are not for human users.

To create a service account:

1. Click **Create Service Account**.
1. In the **Create service account** dialog:
    1. Enter the **Account name**.
    1. (Optional) Enter a **Description** of the service account.
    1. Set the **Permissions** of the service account.

        Granting `ADMIN` permissions allows the service account full authorization for the organization, where the service account can create, modify, and delete clusters.

        The `CREATE` permission allows the service account to create new clusters within the organization.

        The `DELETE` permission allows the service account to delete clusters within the organization.

        The `EDIT` permission allows the service account to modify clusters within the organization.

        The `READ` permission allows the service account to get details about clusters within the organization.

    1. Click **Create**.

1. [Create an API key](#create-api-keys) for the newly created service account, or click **Skip** to go back to the Service Accounts table.

### Modify a service account

To modify the name, description, or permissions of a service account:

1. Click the **Action** button for the service account name in the **Service Accounts** table.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. In the **Edit service account** dialog, modify the name, description, or permissions for the service account.
1. Click **Save changes**.

### API access

Each service account can have one or more API keys. API keys are used to authenticate and authorize service accounts when using the API. All API keys created by the account are listed under **API Access**.

#### Create API keys

To create an API key:

1. Click **Create API Key**.
1. Enter the **API key name** and click **Create**. The name should identify how the API key will be used. For example, you could name your API key for the application that will use the key.
1. Copy the **Secret key** and store it in a secure location. There is a **Copy** button to the right of the displayed secret key that will copy the secret key to your OS clipboard.

    The secret key contains the API key and secret. It should never be shared or publicly accessable. Anyone with the secret key can use the API with the permissions of the service account.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
    The secret key will not be available after closing the **Create API key** dialog. If you have lost your secret key, you should [delete the API key](#delete-api-keys) and create a new one.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Click **Done**.

#### Delete API keys

To delete an API key associated with a service account:

1. Click the **Action** button for the API key ID in the **API Access** table.
1. Select **Delete**.
1. In the **Delete API key** dialog enter the name of the service account to confirm the delete operation, then click **Delete**.

#### Edit API key names

To change the API key name for an existing API key:

1. Find the API key ID in the **API Access** table.
1. Click the **Action** button.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. In the **Edit API key name** dialog modify the API key name and click **Save changes**.

## Call the API

The API uses [bearer token authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and each request requires a [secret key](#api-access). The secret key is associated with a service account, and inherits the [permissions of the account](#service-accounts).

To send the secret key when making an API call, add the secret key to the `Authorization` HTTP header sent with the request.

Where `{secret key}` is the [secret key string you stored when you created the API key in the Console](#create-api-keys).

You will also need your **Organization ID**, located in the **Settings** page of the Console. Replace `{organizationId}` with your ID in the endpoint URIs.

## Create a new cluster

To create a cluster, send a `POST` request to the `/v1/orgs/{organizationId}/clusters` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `CREATE` permissions to create new clusters.

The `{organizationId}` for an organization can be found in the **Settings** page of the Console under **Organization ID**.

## Set the maximum spend limit of a Serverless cluster

To set the maximum spend limit for a Serverless cluster, send a `PUT` request to the `/v1/orgs/{organizationId}/clusters/{clusterId}/spend-limit` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `EDIT` permissions to retrieve information about an organization's clusters.

## Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster, send a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/orgs/{organizationId}/clusters/{clusterId}` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `DELETE` permissions to delete an organization's clusters.

Deleting a cluster will permanently delete the cluster and all the data within the cluster.

## List the available regions for a cloud infrastructure provider

To list the available regions for creating new clusters, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/orgs/{organizationId}/clusters/available-regions?provider={cloud provider}` endpoint. The service account associated with the secret key must have `ADMIN` or `READ` permissions to list the available regions.
