---

While CockroachDB is an excellent system of record, it also needs to coexist with other systems. For example, you might want to keep your data mirrored in full-text indexes, analytics engines, or big data pipelines.

This page walks you through a demonstration of how to use an [{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-changefeed.html) to stream row-level changes to [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), an online analytical processing (OLAP) database.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Snowflake is optimized for `INSERT`s and batch rewrites over streaming updates. This means that CockroachDB changefeeds are unable to send `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s to Snowflake. If this is necessary, additional setup (not covered in this tutorial) can allow entire tables to be replaced in batch.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Admin access to a [{{ site.data.products.db }} account](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/)
- Write access to an [AWS S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com)

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    This tutorial uses AWS S3 for cloud storage, but Snowflake also supports [Azure](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-azure.html) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-gcs.html).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- [Read and write access](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/security-access-control-overview.html) to a Snowflake cluster

## Step 1. Create a cluster

If you have not done so already, [create a cluster](create-your-cluster.html).

## Step 2. Configure your cluster

1. Connect to the built-in SQL shell as a user with Admin privileges, replacing the placeholders in the [client connection string](connect-to-your-cluster.html#step-2-select-a-connection-method) with the correct username, password, and path to the `ca.cert`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --url='postgres://<username>:<password>@<global host>:26257?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=certs/ca.crt'
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    If you haven't connected to your cluster before, see [Connect to your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} Cluster](connect-to-your-cluster.html) or [Connect to your {{ site.data.products.serverless }} Cluster](connect-to-a-serverless-cluster.html) for information on how to initially connect.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Enable [rangefeeds](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds):

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.rangefeed.enabled = true;
    ~~~
    ~~~
    SET CLUSTER SETTING
    ~~~

## Step 3. Create a database

1. In the built-in SQL shell, create a database called `cdc_test`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE cdc_test;
    ~~~
    ~~~
    CREATE DATABASE
    ~~~

1. Set it as the default:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET DATABASE = cdc_test;
    ~~~
    ~~~
    SET
    ~~~

## Step 4. Create tables

Before you can start a changefeed, you need to create at least one table for the changefeed to target. The targeted table's rows are referred to as the "watched rows".

Let's create a table called `order_alerts` to target:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE order_alerts (
    id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING
);
~~~
~~~
CREATE TABLE
~~~

## Step 5. Create an S3 bucket in the AWS Console

Every change to a watched row is emitted as a record in a configurable format (i.e., `JSON` for cloud storage sinks). To configure an AWS S3 bucket as the cloud storage sink:

1. Log in to your [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/).

1. Create an S3 bucket, called `changefeed-example`, where streaming updates from the watched tables will be collected.

    The name of the S3 bucket is needed when you [create your changefeed](#step-6-create-an-enterprise-changefeed). Be sure to have a set of IAM credentials with write access on the S3 bucket that will be used during [changefeed setup](#step-6-create-an-enterprise-changefeed).

## Step 6. Create an enterprise changefeed

Back in the built-in SQL shell, [create an enterprise changefeed](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-changefeed.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE order_alerts
    INTO 's3://changefeed-example?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={access key ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={secret access key}'
    WITH
        updated;
~~~
~~~
        job_id
+--------------------+
  000000000000000000
(1 row)
~~~

Be sure to replace the placeholders with your AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key. See [Cloud Storage Authentication](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/cloud-storage-authentication.html) for more detail on authenticating to Amazon S3.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If your changefeed is running but data is not displaying in your S3 bucket, you might have to [debug your changefeed](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#debug-a-changefeed).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 7. Insert data into the tables

1. In the built-in SQL shell, insert data into the `order_alerts` table that the changefeed is targeting:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO order_alerts
        VALUES
            (1, 'Order received'),
            (2, 'Order processed');
    ~~~
    ~~~
    INSERT 2
    ~~~

1. Navigate back to the [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/) to confirm that the data is now streaming to the bucket. A new directory should display on the **Overview** tab.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    If your changefeed is running but data is not displaying in your S3 bucket, you might have to [debug your changefeed](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#debug-a-changefeed).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 8. Configure Snowflake

1. Log in to Snowflake as a user with [read and write access](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/security-access-control-overview.html) to a cluster.

1. Navigate to the **Worksheet** view.

1. Create a table to store the data to be ingested:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE order_alerts (
       changefeed_record VARIANT
      );
    ~~~

    This will store all of the data in a single [`VARIANT` column](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/semistructured-considerations.html#storing-semi-structured-data-in-a-variant-column-vs-flattening-the-nested-structure) as JSON. You can then access this field with valid JSON and query the column as if it were a table.

1. **Run** the statement.

1. In the Worksheet, create a stage called `cdc-stage`, which tells Snowflake where your data files reside in S3:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE STAGE cdc_stage url='s3://changefeed-example/' credentials=(aws_key_id='<KEY>' aws_secret_key='<SECRET_KEY>') file_format = (type = json);
    ~~~

    Be sure to replace the placeholders with your AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key.

1. In the Worksheet, create a Snowpipe called `cdc-pipe`, which tells Snowflake to auto-ingest data:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE PIPE cdc_pipe auto_ingest = TRUE as COPY INTO order_alerts FROM @cdc_stage;
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Auto-ingest in Snowflake works with [AWS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3.html), [Azure](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-azure.html), and [Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-gcs.html).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. In the Worksheet, view the Snowpipe:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW PIPES;
    ~~~

1. Copy the **ARN** of the SQS queue for your stage (this displays in the **notification_channel** column). You will use this information to [configure the S3 bucket](#step-9-configure-the-s3-bucket).

## Step 9. Configure the S3 bucket

1. [Navigate back to your S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/).

1. Configure an event notification for the S3 bucket. Use the following parameters:
    - **Name:** Name of the event notification (e.g., Auto-ingest Snowflake).
    - **Events:** Select the **All object create events**.
    - **Send to:** Select **SQS Queue** from the drop-down.
    - **SQS:** Select **Add SQS queue ARN** from the drop-down.
    - **SQS queue ARN:** Paste the SQS queue name from the `SHOW PIPES` output (from [Step 8](#step-8-configure-snowflake)).

1. Navigate back to Snowflake.

1. Ingest the data from your stage:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER PIPE cdc_pipe refresh;
    ~~~

1. To view the data in Snowflake, query the `order_alerts` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM order_alerts;
    ~~~

    The ingested rows will display in the **Results** panel. It may take a few minutes for the data to load into the Snowflake cluster. To check on the progress of data being written to the destination table, see [Snowflake's documentation on querying a stage](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/querying-stage.html).

Your changefeed is now streaming to Snowflake.

## Known limitations

- Snowflake cannot filter streaming updates by table. Because of this, we recommend creating a changefeed that watches only one table.
- Snowpipe is unaware of CockroachDB [resolved timestamps](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-changefeed.html#resolved-option). This means CockroachDB transactions will not be loaded atomically and partial transactions can briefly be returned from Snowflake.
- Snowpipe works best with append-only workloads, as Snowpipe lacks native ETL capabilities to perform updates to data. You may need to pre-process data before uploading it to Snowflake.

See the [Change Data Capture Overview](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/change-data-capture-overview.html#known-limitations) for more general changefeed known limitations.
