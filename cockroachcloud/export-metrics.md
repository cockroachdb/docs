{{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can use the [Cloud API](cloud-api.html) to configure metrics export to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). Once the export is configured, metrics will flow from all nodes in all regions of your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster to your chosen cloud metrics sink.

Exporting metrics to AWS CloudWatch is only available on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters which are hosted on AWS, and were created after August 11, 2022. Metrics export to Datadog is supported on all {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters regardless of creation date.

{% include feature-phases/preview-opt-in.md %}

## The `metricexport` endpoint

To configure and manage metrics export for your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster, use the `metricexport` endpoint:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~
https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{your_cluster_id}/metricexport
~~~

Access to the `metricexport` endpoint requires a valid {{ site.data.products.db }} [service account](console-access-management.html#service-accounts) with the appropriate permissions.

The following methods are available for use with the `metricexport` endpoint, and require the listed service account permissions:

Method | Required permissions | Description
--- | --- | ---
`GET` | `ADMIN`, `EDIT`, or `READ` | Returns the current status of the metrics export configuration.
`POST` | `ADMIN` or `EDIT` | Enables metrics export, or updates an existing metrics export configuration.
`DELETE` | `ADMIN` | Disables metrics export, halting all metrics export to AWS CloudWatch or Datadog.

See [Service accounts](console-access-management.html#service-accounts) for instructions on configuring a service account with these required permissions.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The metrics export feature is only available on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters created after August 11, 2022. If your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster was created before this date, you must create a new cluster to utilize metrics export, or [export metrics to Datadog](export-metrics.html?filters=datadog-metrics-export) instead.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Perform the following steps to enable metrics export from your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster to AWS CloudWatch.

1. Create the desired target AWS CloudWatch log group by following the [Create a log group in CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html#Create-Log-Group) instructions. If you already have a log group created, you may skip this step. When your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster emits metrics to AWS CloudWatch, they are written to this log group.

1. Find your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster ID:

	1. Visit the {{ site.data.products.db }} console [cluster page](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters).
	1. Click on the name of your cluster.
	1. Find your cluster ID in the URL of the single cluster overview page: `https://cockroachlabs.cloud/cluster/{your_cluster_id}/overview`. It should resemble `f78b7feb-b6cf-4396-9d7f-494982d7d81e`.

1. Determine your cluster's cloud provider account ID. This command uses the third-party JSON parsing tool [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) to isolate just the needed `account_id` field:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{your_cluster_id} \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}' | jq .account_id
    ~~~

    Where:
    - `{your_cluster_id}` is the cluster ID of your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster as determined in step 2.
    - `{secret_key}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} API key. See [API Access](console-access-management.html) for more details.

1.  Create a cross-account IAM role in your AWS account:

	1. In the AWS console, visit the [IAM page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
	1. Select **Roles** and click **Create role**.
	1. For **Trusted entity type**, select **AWS account**.
	1. Choose **Another AWS account**.
	1. For **Account ID**, provide the {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cloud provider account ID from step 2.
	1. Finish creating the IAM role with a suitable name. These instructions will use the role name `CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole`. You do not need to add any permissions.

	{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
	You will need the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your cross-account IAM role later in this procedure.
	{{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Select the new role, and create a new policy for this role. These instructions will use the policy name `CockroachCloudMetricsExportPolicy`.

1. Select the new policy, and paste the following into the **Permissions** tab, with the **{} JSON** option selected:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::{your_aws_acct_id}:root"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::{your_aws_acct_id}:root"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
        ]
    }
    ~~~

    Where:
    - `{your_aws_acct_id}` is the AWS Account ID of the AWS account where you created the `CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole` role, **not** the cloud provider account ID of your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster from step 2. You can find your AWS Account ID on the AWS [IAM page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

    This defines the set of permissions that the {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} metrics export feature requires to be able to write metrics to CloudWatch.

1. Copy the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the `CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole` role found under **Summary**, which is needed for the next step.

1. Issue the following Cloud API command to enable metrics export for your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/metricexport \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}" \
      --data '{"cloudwatch":{"target_region": "{aws_region}}", "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::{role_arn}:role/CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole", "log_group_name": "{log_group_name}"}}'
    ~~~

    Where:
    - `{cluster_id}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster ID as determined in step 2.
    - `{secret_key}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} API key. See [API Access](console-access-management.html) for instructions on generating this key.
    - `{aws_region}` is your AWS region, like `us-east-1`.
    - `{role_arn}` is the ARN for the `CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole` role you copied in step 7. If you used a different role name there, be sure to use your role name in place of `CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole` in the above command.
    - `{log_group_name}` is the target AWS CloudWatch log group you created in step 1.

    Specifying an AWS region (to `{aws_region}`) that you do not have a cluster in, or a region that only partially covers your cluster's nodes will result in missing metrics.

1. Depending on the size of your cluster and how many regions it spans, the configuration may take a moment. You can monitor the ongoing status of the configuration using the following Cloud API command:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/metricexport \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}"
    ~~~

    Run the command periodically until the command returns a status of `ENABLED`, at which point the configuration across all nodes is complete, and metrics will begin appearing in CloudWatch under the log group you created in step 1. Since the configuration is applied to cluster nodes in a rolling fashion, you may see some metrics appear even before the `GET` command returns an `ENABLED` status.

1. Once metrics export has been enabled, you can access metrics from your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster directly in [AWS CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home).

      --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/metricexport \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}"
    ~~~

    Run the command periodically until the command returns a status of `ENABLED`, at which point the configuration across all nodes is complete, and metrics will begin appearing in the Datadog interface. Since the configuration is applied to cluster nodes in a rolling fashion, you may see some metrics appear even before the `GET` command returns an `ENABLED` status.

1. Once metrics export has been enabled, you can access metrics from your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster directly in Datadog's [Metrics Explorer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/explorer/), or via Datadog's [notebook](https://docs.datadoghq.com/notebooks/) or [dashboard](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/) features.

## Monitor the status of a metrics export configuration

To check the status of an existing {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} metrics export configuration, use the following Cloud API command:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~shell
curl --request GET \
  --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/metricexport \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}"
~~~

Where:

- `{cluster_id}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster's cluster ID, which can be found in the URL of your [Cloud Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters/) for the specific cluster you wish to configure, resembling `f78b7feb-b6cf-4396-9d7f-494982d7d81e`.
- `{secret_key}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} API key. See [API Access](console-access-management.html) for instructions on generating this key.

## Update an existing metrics export configuration

To update an existing {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} metrics export configuration, make any necessary changes to your cloud provider configuration (e.g., AWS CloudWatch or Datadog), then issue the same `POST` Cloud API command as shown in the [Enable metrics export](#enable-metrics-export) instructions for your cloud provider with the desired updated configuration. Follow the [Monitor the status of a metrics export configuration](#monitor-the-status-of-a-metrics-export-configuration) instructions to ensure the update completes successfully.

## Disable metrics export

To disable an existing {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} metrics export configuration, and stop sending metrics to a cloud metrics sink, use the following Cloud API command:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~shell
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/metricexport?type={metrics_export_type} \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}"
~~~

Where:

- `{cluster_id}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster's cluster ID, which can be found in the URL of your [Cloud Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters/) for the specific cluster you wish to configure, resembling `f78b7feb-b6cf-4396-9d7f-494982d7d81e`.
- `{metrics_export_type}` is the metrics export cloud sink target you are using, either: `CLOUDWATCH` or `DATADOG`.
- `{secret_key}` is your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} API key. See [API Access](console-access-management.html) for instructions on generating this key.

## Limitations

- Metrics export to AWS CloudWatch is currently only available on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters created after August 11, 2022.
- Metrics export to AWS CloudWatch is only available on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters which are hosted on AWS. If your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster is hosted on GCP, you can [export metrics to Datadog](export-metrics.html?filters=datadog-metrics-export) instead.
- AWS CloudWatch does not currently support histograms. Any histogram-type metrics emitted from your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster are dropped by CloudWatch. See [Prometheus metric type conversion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-metrics-conversion.html) for more information, and [Logging dropped Prometheus metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights-Prometheus-troubleshooting-EKS.html#ContainerInsights-Prometheus-troubleshooting-droppedmetrics) for instructions on tracking dropped histogram metrics in CloudWatch.

## Troubleshooting

### AWS CloudWatch

Be sure you are providing **your own** AWS Account ID as shown on the AWS [IAM page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) to step 6, **not** the AWS cloud provider account ID as returned from step 2.

If you are using an existing AWS role, or are otherwise using a role name different from the example name used in this tutorial, be sure to use your own role name in step 8 in place of `CockroachCloudMetricsExportRole`.

Your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster must be running on AWS (not GCP), and must have been created after August 11, 2022 to make use of metrics export to AWS CloudWatch.
