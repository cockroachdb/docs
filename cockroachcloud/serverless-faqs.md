## General

### What is {{ site.data.products.serverless }}?

{{ site.data.products.serverless }} delivers free and paid CockroachDB clusters for you and your organization. It is a managed instance of CockroachDB that lets you start using your database immediately and auto-scales based on your application traffic.

### How do I start using {{ site.data.products.serverless }}?

To get started with {{ site.data.products.serverless }}, <a href="https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup?referralId=docs_serverless_faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up for a {{ site.data.products.db }} account</a>, click **Create Cluster**, then click **Create your free cluster**. Your cluster will be ready in 20-30 seconds. For more information, see [**Quickstart**](quickstart.html).

### What are the usage limits of {{ site.data.products.serverless }}?

Clusters start with 10M RUs of free burst capacity and earn 100 RUs per second up to a maximum of 250M free RUs per month. Earned RUs can be used immediately or accumulated. If you use all of your burst capacity and earned RUs, your cluster will revert to baseline performance.

If you set a spend limit, your cluster will not be throttled to baseline performance once you use all of your free earned RUs. Instead, it will continue to use burst performance as needed until you reach your spend limit. You will only be charged for the resources you use up to your spend limit. If you reach your spend limit, your cluster will revert to the baseline performance of 100 RUs per second.

You can create a maximum of five Serverless clusters per Organization.

### What is a Request Unit?

All resource usage in {{ site.data.products.serverless }} is measured in Request Units, or RUs. RUs represent the compute and I/O resources used by a query. All database operations cost a certain amount of RUs depending on the resources used. For example, a "small read" might cost 2 RUs, and a "large read" such as a full table scan with indexes might cost 100 RUs.

### Do I have to pay for {{ site.data.products.serverless }}?

No, you can create a Serverless cluster that is free forever. If you choose to set a spend limit for your cluster, you will only be charged for the resources you use up to your spend limit.

### What can I use {{ site.data.products.serverless }} for?

Free {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters can be used for proofs-of-concept, toy programs, or to use while completing [Cockroach University](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/cockroach-university/).

For examples of applications that use free clusters, check out the following [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com/) projects:

- [flock](https://devpost.com/software/flock-figure-out-what-film-to-watch-with-friends)
- [mntr.tech](https://devpost.com/software/mntr-tech)
- [curbshop.online](https://devpost.com/software/curbshop-online)

Paid Serverless clusters include additional resources to maintain higher performance. They can be used for all kinds of production applications.

### How do I connect to my cluster?

To connect to a cluster, download the CA certificate, and then generate a connection string or parameters. You can use this information to connect to your cluster through the CockroachDB SQL client or a Postgres-compatible driver or ORM. For more details, see [Connect to Your {{ site.data.products.serverless }} Cluster](connect-to-a-serverless-cluster.html).

## Beta release

### Where can I submit feedback or bugs on the beta?

You can submit feedback or log any bugs you find through [this survey](https://forms.gle/jWNgmCFtF4y15ePw5).

## Security

### Is my cluster secure?

Yes, we use separate certificate authorities for each cluster, and all connections to the cluster over the internet use TLS 1.3.

### Is encryption-at-rest enabled on {{ site.data.products.serverless }}?

Yes. All data on {{ site.data.products.db }} is encrypted-at-rest using the tools provided by the cloud provider that your cluster is running in.

- Data stored in clusters running in GCP are encrypted-at-rest using [persistent disk encryption](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pd_encryption).
- Data stored in clusters running in AWS are encrypted-at-rest using [EBS encryption-at-rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html).

Because we are relying on the cloud provider's encryption implementation (as noted above), we do not enable CockroachDB's [internal implementation of encryption-at-rest](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise). This means that encryption will appear to be disabled in the [DB Console](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/ui-overview.html), since it is unaware of cloud provider encryption.

### Is my cluster isolated? Does it share resources with any other clusters?

{{ site.data.products.serverless }} is a multi-tenant offering and resources are shared between clusters. For more information, see [CockroachDB Serverless Architecture](architecture.html).

## Cluster maintenance

### Can I upgrade my free {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster?

Yes, you can upgrade your cluster through the Console by [increasing your spend limit](serverless-cluster-management.html#edit-your-spend-limit) and entering [billing information](billing-management.html) if you haven't already.

## Product features

### Do you have a UI? How can I see details?

Yes, you can view and your clusters in the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/). However, some [DB Console](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/ui-overview.html) pages are not currently available for {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters.

### Can I run bulk operations such as `IMPORT` and `EXPORT` from my cluster?

Yes, see [Run Bulk Operations](run-bulk-operations.html) for more information. If you don't have billing information on file for your Organization, [`userfile`](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/use-userfile-for-bulk-operations.html) is the only available storage options for bulk operations. Once you enter billing information, even if you don't set a spend limit, you will have access to [cloud storage](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html).

### Is change data capture available to me?

Yes, {{ site.data.products.serverless-plan }} clusters have access to [Core Changefeeds](run-bulk-operations.html#stream-data-out-of-your-cockroachdb-cloud-cluster).

### Can I backup my {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster? Does Cockroach Labs take backups of my cluster?

Cockroach Labs takes full cluster backups of all {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters for our own purposes. If you don't have [billing information on file](billing-management.html) for your Organization, you can [take backups locally](run-bulk-operations.html#backup-and-restore-data) to `userfile`. Once you enter billing information, even if you don't set a spend limit, you can also [backup to cloud storage](run-bulk-operations.html#backup-and-restore-data).
