A {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster is single-tenant (no shared machines) running in a Virtual Private Cloud (no shared network) and has data encryption-in-flight enabled by default. Additionally, {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} provides authentication, authorization, and SQL audit logging features to secure your clusters.

The following table summarizes the {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} security features and provides links to detailed documentation for each feature where applicable.

Security feature | Description
-------------|------------
[Authentication](authentication.html) | <ul><li>Inter-node and node identity authentication using TLS 1.2</li><li>Client identity authentication using TLS 1.2 or username/password</li></ul>
Encryption | <ul><li>Encryption-in-flight using TLS 1.2</li><li>Backups for AWS clusters are encrypted-at-rest using [AWS S3â€™s server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)</li><li>Backups for GCP clusters are encrypted-at-rest using [Google-managed server-side encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/default-keys)</li><li>All data on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} is encrypted-at-rest using the tools provided by the cloud provider that your cluster is running in (i.e., [persistent disk encryption](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pd_encryption) for GCP and [EBS encryption-at-rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) for AWS). Because we are relying on the cloud provider's encryption implementation, we do not enable CockroachDB's [internal implementation of encryption-at-rest](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise). This means that encryption will appear to be disabled in the [DB Console](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/ui-overview.html), since it is unaware of cloud provider encryption.</li></ul>
[User Authorization](user-authorization.html) | <ul><li>Users and privileges</li><li> Role-based access control</li></ul>
[Network Authorization](network-authorization.html) | <ul><li>IP allowlisting</li><li> VPC Peering for GCP clusters</li><li> AWS PrivateLink for AWS clusters</li></ul>
[Audit logging](sql-audit-logging.html) | `ALTER TABLE...EXPERIMENTAL AUDIT` to get detailed information about queries being executed against your system
