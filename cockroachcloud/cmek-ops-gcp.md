This page covers the procedures requried to provision a Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) for your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster with Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This is part of the larger process of [Enabling CMEK for a {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster](managing-cmek.html#enable-cmek).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
For multi-region clusters, you must provide a key and IAM role combination per region. You can either:

- provide the same key for all your cluster regions.
- provide a different key per cluster region.
- provide a single multi-region key for the entire cluster.

## Step 1: Provision the cross-account IAM role

Recall that the premise of CMEK is that you, the customer, maintain control over your encryption key, while (temporarily) granting access to Cockroach Labs' to encrypt and data for you. Here we will create a 'cross-account IAM role', i.e., a role in your AWS account that can be temporarily assumed by users in another account, in this case, Cockroach Labs' account. This role will have permissions to use the key.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
To create this link, you will also need your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} Organization ID, which you can find from the {{ site.data.products.db }} console [clusters page](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/cluster).

Make sure you have the updated Organization ID from after CMEK has been enabled for your organization.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Find Cockroach Labs' GCP Project ID
	
	You must find the Project ID of Cockroach Labs' GCP Project associated with your cluster, as well as your cluster id. To find this information, query the clusters endpoint of the {{ site.data.products.db }} API.

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	```shell
	curl --request GET \
	  --url https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{YOUR_CLUSTER_ID} \
	  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}' | jq
	```
	Record the following:
	- `account_id`: (the associated GCP Project ID)
	- `id`: your cluster id
	

1.  Create a cross-account IAM role in your AWS account, configuring a policy with encrypt and decrypt permissions on the KMS key.

	1. In the AWS console, visit the [IAM page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
	1. Select **Roles** and click **Create role**.
	1. For **Trusted entity type**, select **AWS account**.
	1. Choose **Another AWS account**.
		1. For **Account ID**, provide the provide the Cockroach Labs AWS Account ID that you found previously by querying your cluster's Cloud API.
		1. Select the option to **Require external ID**, and for the value of **External ID**, provide your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} Organization ID.
	1. Finish creating the IAM role with a suitable name, such as . You do not need to add any permissions.

	{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
	You will need the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your cross-account IAM role in the next step.
	{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 2: Create the CMEK

1. In the AWS console, visit the [KMS page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/). 
1. Choose **Customer managed keys** and click the **Create Key** button.
1. For **Key type**, specify **Symmetric Key**.
1. For **Key usage**, specify **Encrypt and decrypt**.
1. Under **Advanced options**, choose **KMS** for **Key material**.
1. Select whether you will use your key for a single region or a multi-region cluster.
1. Give the key a suitable name, or **alias**.
1. Set the permissions for your key with the following IAM policy, using the ARN for your cross-account IAM role you created at the end of [Step 1: Provision the cross-account IAM role](#step-1-provision-the-cross-account-iam-role).
	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	```json
		{
		"Version": "2012-10-17",
		"Id": "key-consolepolicy-3",
		"Statement": [
		    {
		        "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
		        "Effect": "Allow",
		        "Principal": {
		            "AWS": <YOUR_IAM_ROLE_ARN>
		        },
		        "Action": [
		            "kms:Encrypt",
		            "kms:Decrypt",
		            "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
		            "kms:DescribeKey",
		            "kms:ReEncrypt*",
		        ],
		        "Resource": "*"
		    }
		]
	}	
	```

1. Finish creating the key.

## Step 1: Provision the IAM role

## Step 2: Create the key

1. Navigate to the GCP console [KMS page](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms).
1. Select **+ CREATE KEY RING** and create a key ring for your cluster's CMEK.
1. Configure your new key:
	1. Select **Generated key**.
	1. Select **Symmetric encrypt/decrypt** for **Purpose**.


Note down the resource IDs of the KMS Key(s). Do not specify a version as CockroachDB Dedicated will use the latest active version for encryption, and any previous rotated versions for decryption (if data being accessed was last written & encrypted before automatic rotation). 

The resource ID format should look like the following:

projects/{project-id}/locations/{project-location}/keyRings/{key-ring-name}/cryptoKeys/{key-name}
