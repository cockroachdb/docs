{% include cockroachcloud/filter-tabs/create-cluster-cloud.md %}

This page walks you through the process of creating a cluster using {{ site.data.products.serverless }}. Note that only [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console Administrators](console-access-management.html#console-admin) can create clusters. If you are a Developer and need to create a cluster, contact your {{ site.data.products.db }} Administrator.

## Before you begin

If you haven't already, <a href="https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup?referralId=docs_create_serverless_cluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up for a {{ site.data.products.db }} account</a>.

## Step 1. Start the cluster creation process

1. [Log in](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/) to your {{ site.data.products.db }} account.
{% include cockroachcloud/prefer-sso.md %}
1. If there are multiple [organizations](console-access-management.html#organization) in your account, select the correct organization in the top right corner.
1. On the **Overview** page, click **Create Cluster**.

## Step 2. Select a cloud provider & region

1. _(Optional)_ Select a cloud provider (GCP or AWS) in the **Cloud provider** section.

1. _(Optional)_ Select a region in the **Regions** section. For optimal performance, select the cloud provider region closest to the region in which you are running your application.

If you want to create a cluster in an unavailable region, please [contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You do not need an account with the cloud provider you choose in order to create a cluster on that cloud provider. The cluster is created on infrastructure managed by Cockroach Labs. If you have existing cloud services on either GCP or AWS that you intend to use with your {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster, you should select that cloud provider and the region closest to your existing cloud services to maximize performance.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 3. Enter a spend limit

Every cluster starts with 10M RUs of free [burst capacity](architecture.html#cockroachdb-cloud-terms) each month and earns 100 RUs per second up to a maximum of 250M free RUs per month. Earned RUs can be used immediately or accumulated as burst capacity. If you use all of your burst capacity, your cluster will revert to baseline performance.

If you set a spend limit, your cluster will not be throttled to baseline performance once you use all of your free earned RUs. Instead, it will continue to use burst performance as needed until you reach your spend limit. You will only be charged for the resources you use up to your spend limit. If you reach your spend limit, your cluster will revert to the baseline performance of 100 RUs per second.

{% include cockroachcloud/serverless-usage.md %} For more information, see [Planning your cluster](plan-your-cluster.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Regardless of whether you set a spend limit, [adding billing information](billing-management.html) for your organization allows you to use [cloud storage for backups](take-and-restore-customer-owned-backups.html). Organizations without billing information are limited to [using `userfile` storage for bulk operations](take-and-restore-customer-owned-backups.html).
