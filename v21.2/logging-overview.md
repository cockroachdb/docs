If you need to monitor your cluster, tune performance, or [troubleshoot](troubleshooting-overview.html) issues, you can check the CockroachDB logs, which include details about notable cluster, node, and range-level events.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The default logging configuration has changed in v21.2. For a summary of what has changed, see [Changes to logging system](#changes-to-logging-system).

## Details

When a node processes a [`cockroach` command](cockroach-commands.html), it produces a stream of messages about the command's activities. Each message is composed of:

- A payload that contains events either structured in JSON or conveyed in an arbitrary string. For details on structured event types and their fields, see [Notable Event Types](eventlog.html).
- An envelope that contains event metadata (e.g., severity, date, timestamp, channel). Depending on the log format you specify when [configuring logs](configure-logs.html#file-logging-format), the envelope can be formatted either in JSON or as a flat prefix to the message.

Messages are organized into appropriate [logging channels](#logging-channels) and then routed through log sinks. Each sink further processes and filters the messages before emitting them to destinations outside CockroachDB. The mapping of channels to sinks, as well as the processing and filtering done by each sink, is configurable and is intended to support multiple [use cases](logging-use-cases.html). For more information on configuring sinks and severity levels, see [Configure Logs](configure-logs.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
All [`cockroach` commands](cockroach-commands.html) support logging. However, note that most messages related to cluster operation are generated by [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) or [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html). Other commands generate messages related to their own execution, which are mainly useful when troubleshooting the behaviors of those commands.

## Logging channels

Log messages in CockroachDB are directed into logging channels, which can in turn be assigned to output to one or more [log sinks](configure-logs.html#configure-log-sinks).

This allows you to group channels that log related information (e.g., operational, security, or SQL events) into their own sinks. Each sink can output to a predetermined destination where the logs can be collected and parsed. For usage examples, see [Logging Use Cases](logging-use-cases.html).

| Channel                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Logging channels are analogous to [logging facilities in Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) or [logging services in Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/?tab=http#reserved-attributes). For more details on the contents of each logging channel, see the [Logging reference](logging.html#logging-channels).

## Changes to logging system

When using the [default logging configuration](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration), the events collected on each [logging channel](#logging-channels) are split into log files as follows:

| Filename                                                                  | Description             | Channels                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------|
| `cockroach.log`                                                           | General CockroachDB log | `DEV`                       |
| `cockroach-health.log`                                                    | Health log              | `HEALTH`                    |
| {% include_cached new-in.html version=v21.2 %} `cockroach-security.log`   | SQL security log        | `PRIVILEGES` + `USER_ADMIN` |
| `cockroach-sql-audit.log`                                                 | SQL access audit log    | `SENSITIVE_ACCESS`          |
| `cockroach-sql-auth.log`                                                  | SQL authentication log  | `SESSIONS`                  |
| `cockroach-sql-exec.log`                                                  | SQL execution log       | `SQL_EXEC`                  |
| `cockroach-sql-slow.log`                                                  | SQL slow query log      | `SQL_PERF`                  |
| {% include_cached new-in.html version=v21.2 %} `cockroach-sql-schema.log` | SQL schema change log   | `SQL_SCHEMA`                |
| `cockroach-pebble.log`                                                    | Pebble log              | `STORAGE`                   |
| {% include_cached new-in.html version=v21.2 %} `cockroach-telemetry.log`  | Telemetry log           | `TELEMETRY`                 |

 Logging is now configurable via YAML. The YAML configuration allows you to customize which kinds of events are output to different logging destinations, along with many other parameters. As a result, the logging flags previously used with `cockroach` commands are now deprecated in favor of the YAML configuration. For details, see [Configure Logs](configure-logs.html).
