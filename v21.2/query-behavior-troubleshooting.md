## Identify slow statements

Use the [slow query log](logging-use-cases.html#sql_perf) or DB Console to detect slow queries in your cluster.

High latency SQL statements are displayed on the [Statements](ui-statements-page.html) page of the DB Console. To view the Statements page, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and click **Statements** on the left.

You can also check the [service latency graph](ui-sql-dashboard.html#service-latency-sql-99th-percentile) and the [CPU graph](ui-hardware-dashboard.html#cpu-percent) on the SQL and Hardware Dashboards, respectively. If the graphs show latency spikes or CPU usage spikes, these might indicate slow queries in your cluster.

## Visualize statement traces in Jaeger

You can look more closely at the behavior of a statement by visualizing a statement trace in [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). A [statement trace](show-trace.html) contains messages and timing information from all nodes involved in the execution.

1. Activate [statement diagnostics](ui-statements-page.html#diagnostics) on the DB Console Statements Page or run [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`](explain-analyze.html#debug-option) to obtain a diagnostics bundle for the statement.

1. Start Jaeger:

  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ shell
  docker run -d --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.17
  ~~~

1. Access the Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686/search`.

1. Click **JSON File** in the Jaeger UI and upload `trace-jaeger.json` from the diagnostics bundle. The trace will appear in the list on the right.

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.2/jaeger-trace-json.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Jaeger Trace Upload JSON" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:40%" />

1. Click the trace to view its details. It is visualized as a collection of spans with timestamps. These may include operations executed by different nodes.

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.2/jaeger-trace-spans.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Jaeger Trace Spans" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    The full timeline displays the execution time and [execution phases](architecture/sql-layer.html#sql-parser-planner-executor) for the statement.

1. Click a span to view details for that span and log messages.

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.2/jaeger-trace-log-messages.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Jaeger Trace Log Messages" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

1. You can troubleshoot [transaction contention](performance-best-practices-overview.html#transaction-contention), for example, by gathering [diagnostics](ui-statements-page.html#diagnostics) on statements with high latency and looking through the log messages in `trace-jaeger.json` for jumps in latency.

  In the example below, the trace shows that there is significant latency between a push attempt on a transaction that is holding a [lock](architecture/transaction-layer.html#writing) (56.85ms) and that transaction being committed (131.37ms).

## `SELECT` statement performance issues

The common reasons for a sub-optimal `SELECT` performance are inefficient scans, full scans, and incorrect use of indexes. To improve the performance of `SELECT` statements, refer to the following documents:

-  [Table scan best practices](performance-best-practices-overview.html#table-scan-best-practices)

-  [Indexes best practices](schema-design-indexes.html#best-practices)

## Query is always slow

If you have consistently slow queries in your cluster, use the [Statement Details](ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) page to drill down to an individual statement and [collect diagnostics](ui-statements-page.html#diagnostics) for the statement. A diagnostics bundle contains a record of transaction events across nodes for the SQL statement.

You can also use an [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain-analyze.html) statement, which executes a SQL query and returns a physical query plan with execution statistics. Query plans can be used to troubleshoot slow queries by indicating where time is being spent, how long a processor (i.e., a component that takes streams of input rows and processes them according to a specification) is not doing work, etc.

Cockroach Labs recommends sending either the diagnostics bundle (preferred) or the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output to our [support team](support-resources.html) for analysis.

## Query is sometimes slow

If the query performance is irregular:

1.  Run [`SHOW TRACE`](show-trace.html) for the query twice: once when the query is performing as expected and once when the query is slow.

2.  [Contact us](support-resources.html) to analyze the outputs of the `SHOW TRACE` command.

## Cancel running queries

See [Cancel long-running queries](manage-long-running-queries.html#cancel-long-running-queries).

## Low throughput

Throughput is affected by the disk I/O, CPU usage, and network latency. Use the DB Console to check the following metrics:

- Disk I/O: [Disk IOPS in progress](ui-hardware-dashboard.html#disk-ops-in-progress)

- CPU usage: [CPU percent](ui-hardware-dashboard.html#cpu-percent)

- Network latency: [Network Latency page](ui-network-latency-page.html)

## Single hot node

A *hot node* is one that has much higher resource usage than other nodes. To determine if you have a hot node in your cluster, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and check the following:

- Click **Metrics** and navigate to the following graphs. Hover over each graph to see the per-node values of the metrics. If one of the nodes has a higher value, you have a hot node in your cluster.
  - [**Replication** dashboard](ui-replication-dashboard.html) > **Average Queries per Store** graph
  - [**Overview** dashboard](ui-overview-dashboard.html) > **Service Latency** graph
  - [**Hardware** dashboard](ui-hardware-dashboard.html) > **CPU Percent** graph
  - [**SQL** dashboard](ui-sql-dashboard.html) > **SQL Connections** graph
  - [**Hardware** dashboard](ui-hardware-dashboard.html) > **Disk IOPS in Progress** graph
- Open the [**Hot Ranges** page](ui-hot-ranges-page.html) and check for ranges with significantly higher QPS on any nodes.

**Solution:**

- If you have a small table that fits into one range, then only one of the nodes will be used. This is expected behavior. However, you can [split your range](split-at.html) to distribute the table across multiple nodes.

- If the SQL Connections graph shows that one node has a higher number of SQL connections and other nodes have zero connections, check if your app is set to talk to only one node.

- Check load balancer settings.

- Check for [transaction contention](performance-best-practices-overview.html#transaction-contention).

- If you have a monotonically increasing index column or Primary Key, then your index or Primary Key should be redesigned. For more information, see [Unique ID best practices](performance-best-practices-overview.html#unique-id-best-practices).

- If a range has significantly higher QPS on a node, there may be a hot spot on the range that needs to be reduced. For more information, see [Hot spots](performance-best-practices-overview.html#hot-spots).

## INSERT/UPDATE statements are slow

Use the [Statements page](ui-statements-page.html) to identify the slow [SQL statements](sql-statements.html). To view the Statements page, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and then click Statements on the left.

Refer to the following documents to improve `INSERT` / `UPDATE` performance:

-   [Multi-row DML](performance-best-practices-overview.html#dml-best-practices)

-   [Bulk-Insert best practices](performance-best-practices-overview.html#bulk-insert-best-practices)

## Per-node queries per second (QPS) is high

If a cluster is not idle, it is useful to monitor the per-node queries per second. Cockroach will automatically distribute load throughout the cluster. If one or more nodes is not performing any queries there is likely something to investigate. See `exec_success` and `exec_errors` which track operations at the KV layer and `sql_{select,insert,update,delete}_count` which track operations at the SQL layer.

## Increasing number of nodes does not improve performance

See [Why would increasing the number of nodes not result in more operations per second?](operational-faqs.html#why-would-increasing-the-number-of-nodes-not-result-in-more-operations-per-second)

## `bad connection` & `closed` responses

If you receive a response of `bad connection` or `closed`, this normally indicates that the node you connected to died. You can check this by connecting to another node in the cluster and running [`cockroach node status`](cockroach-node.html#show-the-status-of-all-nodes).

Once you find the downed node, you can check its [logs](logging.html) (stored in `cockroach-data/logs` by [default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration)).

Because this kind of behavior is entirely unexpected, you should [file an issue](file-an-issue.html).

## Local query testing

If you are testing CockroachDB locally and want to log queries executed just by a specific node, you can either pass a CLI flag at node startup or execute a SQL function on a running node.

Using the CLI to start a new node, use the `--vmodule` flag with the [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) command. For example, to start a single node locally and log all client-generated SQL queries it executes, you'd run:

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --insecure --listen-addr=localhost --vmodule=exec_log=2 --join=<join addresses>
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To log CockroachDB-generated SQL queries as well, use `--vmodule=exec_log=3`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

From the SQL prompt on a running node, execute the `crdb_internal.set_vmodule()` [function](functions-and-operators.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT crdb_internal.set_vmodule('exec_log=2');
~~~

This will result in the following output:

~~~
  crdb_internal.set_vmodule
+---------------------------+
                          0
(1 row)
~~~

Once the logging is enabled, all client-generated SQL queries executed by the node will be written to the `DEV` [logging channel](logging.html#dev), which outputs by [default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration) to the primary `cockroach` log file in `/cockroach-data/logs`. Use the symlink `cockroach.log` to open the most recent log.
