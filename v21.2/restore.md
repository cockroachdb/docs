title: RESTORE
summary: Restore your CockroachDB cluster to a cloud storage services such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or other NFS.
toc: true
docs_area: reference.sql
---

The `RESTORE` [statement](sql-statements.html) restores your cluster's schemas and data from [a `BACKUP`](backup.html) stored on services such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or NFS.

Because CockroachDB is designed with high fault tolerance, restores are designed primarily for disaster recovery, i.e., restarting your cluster if it loses a majority of its nodes. Isolated issues (such as small-scale node outages) do not require any intervention.

You can restore:

- [A full cluster](#full-cluster)
- [Databases](#databases)
- [Tables](#tables)

For details on restoring across versions of CockroachDB, see [Restoring Backups Across Versions](restoring-backups-across-versions.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The [`BACKUP ... TO`](../v20.2/backup.html) and [`RESTORE ... FROM`](../v20.2/restore.html) syntax is **deprecated** as of v22.1 and will be removed in a future release.

We recommend using the `BACKUP ... INTO {collection}` syntax, which creates or adds to a [backup collection](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#backup-collections) in your storage location. For restoring backups, we recommend using `RESTORE FROM {backup} IN {collection}` with `{backup}` being [`LATEST`](#restore-the-most-recent-backup) or a specific [subdirectory](#subdir-param).

For guidance on the syntax for backups and restores, see the [`BACKUP`](backup.html#examples) and [`RESTORE`](restore.html#examples) examples.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Considerations

- `RESTORE` cannot restore backups made by newer versions of CockroachDB.
- `RESTORE` is a blocking statement. To run a restore job asynchronously, use the `DETACHED` option. See [Options](#options) for more usage detail.
- `RESTORE` no longer requires an Enterprise license, regardless of the options passed to it or to the backup it is restoring.
- [Zone configurations](configure-zone.html) present on the destination cluster prior to a restore will be **overwritten** during a [cluster restore](restore.html#full-cluster) with the zone configurations from the [backed up cluster](backup.html#backup-a-cluster). If there were no customized zone configurations on the cluster when the backup was taken, then after the restore the destination cluster will use the zone configuration from the [`RANGE DEFAULT` configuration](configure-replication-zones.html#view-the-default-replication-zone).
- You cannot restore a backup of a multi-region database into a single-region database.

## Required privileges

- [Full cluster restores](#full-cluster) can only be run by members of the [`ADMIN` role](security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.
- For all other restores, the user must have [write access](security-reference/authorization.html#managing-privileges) (`CREATE` or `INSERT`) on all objects affected.

</div>

## Parameters

 Parameter | Description
-----------|-------------
 `table_pattern` | The table or [view](views.html) you want to restore.
 `database_name` | The name of the database you want to restore (i.e., restore all tables and views in the database). You can restore an entire database only if you had backed up the entire database.
 `destination` | The URL where the [full backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) (and appended [incremental backups](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups), if applicable) is stored. <br/><br/>For information about this URL structure, see [Backup File URLs](#backup-file-urls).
`LATEST` | Restore the most recent backup in the given location. See the [Restore the most recent backup](#restore-the-most-recent-backup) example.
<a name="subdir-param"></a>`subdirectory` | Restore from a specific subdirectory in the given collection URI. See the [Restore a specific backup](#restore-a-specific-backup) example.
 `partitioned_backup_location` | The URL where a [locality-aware backup](take-and-restore-locality-aware-backups.html) is stored. When restoring from an incremental locality-aware backup, you need to include _every_ locality ever used, even if it was only used once.<br/><br/>For information about this URL structure, see [Backup File URLs](#backup-file-urls).
 <a name="as-of-system-time"></a>`AS OF SYSTEM TIME timestamp` | Restore data as it existed as of [`timestamp`](as-of-system-time.html). You can restore point-in-time data only if you had taken full or incremental backup [with revision history](take-backups-with-revision-history-and-restore-from-a-point-in-time.html).
 `restore_options_list` | Control your backup's behavior with [these options](#options).

### Options

You can control `RESTORE` behavior using any of the following in the `restore_options_list`. To set multiple `RESTORE` options, use a comma-separated list:

 Option                                                             | <div style="width:75px">Value</div>         | Description
 -------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------
<a name="into_db"></a>`into_db`                                     | Database name                               | Use to [change the target database](#restore-tables-into-a-different-database) for table restores. The target database must exist before a restore with `into_db`. (Does not apply to database or cluster restores.)<br><br>Example: `WITH into_db = 'newdb'`
<a name="skip_missing_foreign_keys"></a>`skip_missing_foreign_keys` | N/A                                         | Use to remove the missing [foreign key](foreign-key.html) constraints before restoring.<br><br>Example: `WITH skip_missing_foreign_keys`
<a name="skip_missing_sequences"></a>`skip_missing_sequences`       | N/A                                         | Use to ignore [sequence](show-sequences.html) dependencies (i.e., the `DEFAULT` expression that uses the sequence).<br><br>Example: `WITH skip_missing_sequences`
`skip_missing_sequence_owners`                                      | N/A                                         | Must be used when restoring either a table that was previously a [sequence owner](create-sequence.html#owned-by) or a sequence that was previously owned by a table.<br><br>Example: `WITH skip_missing_sequence_owners`
`skip_missing_views`                                                | N/A                                         | Use to skip restoring [views](views.html) that cannot be restored because their dependencies are not being restored at the same time.<br><br>Example: `WITH skip_missing_views`
<a name="skip-localities-check"></a>`skip_localities_check`         | N/A                                         | **New in v21.2:** Use to skip checking localities of a cluster before a restore when there are mismatched [cluster regions](multiregion-overview.html#cluster-regions) between the backup's cluster and the target cluster. <br><br>Example: `WITH skip_localities_check`
`encryption_passphrase`                                             | Passphrase used to create the [encrypted backup](take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html) |  The passphrase used to decrypt the file(s) that were encrypted by the [`BACKUP`](take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html) statement.
`DETACHED`                                                          | N/A                                         |  When `RESTORE` runs with `DETACHED`, the job will execute asynchronously. The job ID is returned after the restore job creation completes. Note that with `DETACHED` specified, further job information and the job completion status will not be returned. For more on the differences between the returned job data, see the [example](restore.html#restore-a-backup-asynchronously) below. To check on the job status, use the [`SHOW JOBS`](show-jobs.html) statement. <br><br>To run a restore within a [transaction](transactions.html), use the `DETACHED` option.
`debug_pause_on`                                                    | `"error" `                                    | **New in v21.2:** Use to have a `RESTORE` [job](show-jobs.html) self pause when it encounters an error. The `RESTORE` job can then be [resumed](resume-job.html) after the error has been fixed or [canceled](cancel-job.html) to rollback the job. <br><br>Example: `WITH debug_pause_on='error'`

### Backup file URLs

CockroachDB uses the URL provided to construct a secure API call to the service you specify. The URL structure depends on the type of file storage you are using. For more information, see the following:

- [Use Cloud Storage for Bulk Operations](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html)

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    HTTP storage is not supported for `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- [Use a Local File Server for Bulk Operations](use-a-local-file-server-for-bulk-operations.html)

## Functional details

You can restore:

- [A full cluster](#full-cluster)
- [Databases](#databases)
- [Tables](#tables)

`RESTORE` will only restore the latest data in an object (table, database, cluster), or the latest data as per an [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME` restore](#as-of-system-time). That is, a restore will not include historical data even if you ran your backup with [`revision_history`](backup.html#with-revision-history). This means that if you issue an `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` query on a restored object, the query will fail or the response will be incorrect because there is no historical data to query. For example, if you restore a table at `2022-07-13 10:38:00`, it is not then possible to read or [back up](backup.html) that table at `2022-07-13 10:37:00` or earlier. This is also the case for backups with `revision_history` that might try to initiate a revision start time earlier than `2022-07-13 10:38:00`.

#### Full cluster

 A full cluster restore can only be run on a target cluster with no user-created databases or tables. Restoring a full cluster includes:

- All user tables
- Relevant system tables
- All [databases](create-database.html)
- All [tables](create-table.html) (which automatically includes their [indexes](indexes.html))
- All [views](views.html)

Furthermore, [temporary tables](temporary-tables.html) will restore to [`defaultdb`](show-databases.html#preloaded-databases).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
When you restore a full cluster with an Enterprise license, it will restore the [Enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html) of the cluster you are restoring from. If you want to use a different license in the new cluster, make sure to [update the license](licensing-faqs.html#set-a-license) _after_ the restore is complete.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Databases

**The database cannot already exist in the target cluster.** Restoring a database will create a new database and restore all of its tables and views. The created database will have the name of the database in the backup.

~~~ sql
RESTORE DATABASE backup_database_name FROM LATEST in 'your_backup_location';
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If [dropping](drop-database.html) or [renaming](rename-database.html) an existing database is not an option, you can use [_table_ restore](#restore-a-table) to restore all tables into the existing database by using the [`WITH into_db` option](#options).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Tables

You can also restore individual tables (which automatically includes their indexes) or [views](views.html) from a backup. This process uses the data stored in the backup to create entirely new tables or views in the target database.

By default, tables and views are restored into a target database matching the name of the database from which they were backed up. If the target database does not exist, you must [create it](create-database.html). You can choose to change the target database with the [`into_db` option](#into_db).

The target database must not have tables or views with the same name as the tables or views you're restoring. If any of the restore target's names are being used, you can:

- [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.html), [`DROP VIEW`](drop-view.html), or [`DROP SEQUENCE`](drop-sequence.html) and then restore them. Note that a sequence cannot be dropped while it is being used in a column's `DEFAULT` expression, so those expressions must be dropped before the sequence is dropped, and recreated after the sequence is recreated. The `setval` [function](functions-and-operators.html#sequence-functions) can be used to set the value of the sequence to what it was previously.
- [Restore the table or view into a different database](#into_db).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`RESTORE` only offers table-level granularity; it **does not** support restoring subsets of a table.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

When restoring an individual table that references a user-defined type (e.g., [`ENUM`](enum.html)), CockroachDB will first check to see if the type already exists. The restore will attempt the following for each user-defined type within a table backup:

- If there is _not_ an existing type in the cluster with the same name, CockroachDB will create the user-defined type as it exists in the backup.
- If there is an existing type in the cluster with the same name that is compatible with the type in the backup, CockroachDB will map the type in the backup to the type in the cluster.
- If there is an existing type in the cluster with the same name but it is _not_ compatible with the type in the backup, the restore will not succeed and you will be asked to resolve the naming conflict. You can do this by either [dropping](drop-type.html) or [renaming](alter-type.html) the existing user-defined type.

In general, two types are compatible if they are the same kind (e.g., an enum is only compatible with other enums). Additionally, enums are only compatible if they have the same ordered set of elements that have also been [created in the same way](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20200331_enums.md#physical-layout). For example:

- `CREATE TYPE t1 AS ENUM ('yes', 'no')` and `CREATE TYPE t2 AS ENUM ('yes', 'no')` are compatible.
- `CREATE TYPE t1 AS ENUM ('yes', 'no')` and `CREATE TYPE t2 AS ENUM ('no', 'yes')` are not compatible.
- `CREATE TYPE t1 AS ENUM ('yes', 'no')` and `CREATE TYPE t2 AS ENUM ('yes'); ALTER TYPE t2 ADD VALUE ('no')` are not compatible because they were not created in the same way.

### Object dependencies

Dependent objects must be restored at the same time as the objects they depend on.

Object | Depends On
-------|-----------
Table with [foreign key](foreign-key.html) constraints | The table it `REFERENCES` (however, this dependency can be [removed during the restore](#skip_missing_foreign_keys)).
Table with a [sequence](create-sequence.html) | The sequence.
[Views](views.html) | The tables used in the view's `SELECT` statement.

### Users and privileges

The owner of restored objects will be the user running the restore job. To restore your users and privilege [grants](grant.html), you can do a cluster backup and restore the cluster to a fresh cluster with no user data.

If you are not doing a full cluster restore, the table-level privileges need to be granted to the users after the restore is complete. (By default, the user restoring will become the owner of the restored objects.) To grant table-level privileges after a restore, backup the `system.users` table, [restore users and their passwords](restore.html#restoring-users-from-system-users-backup), and then [grant](grant.html) the table-level privileges.

### Restore types

You can either restore from a full backup or from a full backup with incremental backups, based on the backup files you include:

Restore Type | Parameters
-------------|----------
Full backup | Include the path to the full backup destination and the [subdirectory](#view-the-backup-subdirectories) of the backup. See the [Examples](#examples) section for syntax of [cluster](#restore-a-cluster), [database](#restore-a-database), and [table](#restore-a-table) restores.
Full backup + <br>incremental backups | Include the path that contains the backup collection and the [subdirectory](#view-the-backup-subdirectories) containing the incremental backup. See [Restore from incremental backups](#restore-from-incremental-backups) for an example.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
CockroachDB does **not** support incremental-only restores.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Performance

The `RESTORE` process minimizes its impact to the cluster's performance by distributing work to all nodes. Subsets of the restored data (known as ranges) are evenly distributed among randomly selected nodes, with each range initially restored to only one node. Once the range is restored, the node begins replicating it to others.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
When a `RESTORE` fails or is canceled, partially restored data is properly cleaned up. This can have a minor, temporary impact on cluster performance.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Restoring to multi-region databases

{% include_cached new-in.html version="v21.2" %} Restoring to a [multi-region database](multiregion-overview.html) is supported with some limitations. This section outlines details and settings that should be considered when restoring into multi-region databases:

- A [cluster's regions](multiregion-overview.html#cluster-regions) will be checked before a restore. Mismatched regions between backup and restore clusters will be flagged before the restore begins, which allows for a decision between updating the [cluster localities](cockroach-start.html#locality) or restoring with the [`skip_localities_check`](#skip-localities-check) option to continue with the restore regardless.

- A database that is restored with the `sql.defaults.primary_region` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) will have the [`PRIMARY REGION`](set-primary-region.html) from this cluster setting assigned to the target database.

- `RESTORE` supports restoring **non**-multi-region tables into a multi-region database and sets the table locality as [`REGIONAL BY TABLE`](multiregion-overview.html#regional-tables) to the primary region of the target database.

- Restoring tables from multi-region databases with table localities set to [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables), `REGIONAL BY TABLE`, [`REGIONAL BY TABLE IN PRIMARY REGION`](set-locality.html#regional-by-table), and [`GLOBAL`](set-locality.html#global) to another multi-region database is supported.

- When restoring a `REGIONAL BY TABLE IN PRIMARY REGION` table, if the primary region is different in the source database to the target database this will be implicitly changed on restore.

- Restoring a [partition](partitioning.html) of a `REGIONAL BY ROW` table is not supported.

- {% include {{ page.version.version }}/known-limitations/restore-multiregion-match.md %}

The ordering of regions and how region matching is determined is a known limitation. See the [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) section for the tracking issues on limitations around `RESTORE` and multi-region support.

For more on multi-region databases, see the [Multi-Region Capabilities Overview](multiregion-overview.html).

## Viewing and controlling restore jobs

After CockroachDB successfully initiates a restore, it registers the restore as a job, which you can view with [`SHOW JOBS`](show-jobs.html).

After the restore has been initiated, you can control it with [`PAUSE JOB`](pause-job.html), [`RESUME JOB`](resume-job.html), and [`CANCEL JOB`](cancel-job.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If initiated correctly, the statement returns when the restore is finished or if it encounters an error. In some cases, the restore can continue after an error has been returned (the error message will tell you that the restore has resumed in background).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Examples

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/backups/bulk-auth-options.md %}

### View the backup subdirectories

`BACKUP ... INTO` adds a backup to a [collection](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#backup-collections) within the backup destination. The path to the backup is created using a date-based naming scheme. To view the backup paths in a given destination, use [`SHOW BACKUPS`](show-backup.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW BACKUPS IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

~~~
       path
-------------------------
/2021/12/14-190909.83
/2021/12/20-155249.37
/2021/12/21-142943.73
(3 rows)
~~~

When you want to [restore a specific backup](#restore-a-specific-backup), add the backup's subdirectory path (e.g., `/2021/12/21-142943.73`) to the `RESTORE` statement. For details on viewing the most recent backup, see [`SHOW BACKUP LATEST`](show-backup.html#show-the-most-recent-backup).

Incremental backups will be appended to the full backup with `BACKUP ... INTO LATEST IN {destination}`. Your storage location will contain the incremental as a date-based subdirectory within the full backup.

In the following example `/2021/12/21-142943.73` contains the full backup. The incremental backups (`144748.08/` and `144639.97/`) are appended as subdirectories to the full backup:

~~~
2021
|—— 12
   |—— 21-142943.73/
       |—— 20211221/
           |—— 144748.08/
           |—— 144639.97/
~~~

To output more detail about the backups contained within a directory, see [View a list of the full and incremental backups in a specific full backup subdirectory](show-backup.html#view-a-list-of-the-full-and-incremental-backups-in-a-specific-full-backup-subdirectory).

See [Incremental backups with explicitly specified destinations](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups-with-explicitly-specified-destinations) to control where your backups go.

### Restore the most recent backup

{% include_cached new-in.html version="v21.2.3" %} To restore from the most recent backup in the collection's location, use the `LATEST syntax`:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESTORE FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

### Restore a specific backup

To restore a specific backup, use the backup's [subdirectory](#subdir-param) in the collection's location:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESTORE FROM '2021/03/23-213101.37' IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

To view the available subdirectories, use [`SHOW BACKUPS`](#view-the-backup-subdirectories).

### Restore a cluster

To restore a full cluster:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESTORE FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

To view the available subdirectories, use [`SHOW BACKUPS`](#view-the-backup-subdirectories).

### Restore a database

To restore a database:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESTORE DATABASE bank FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

To view the available subdirectories, use [`SHOW BACKUPS`](#view-the-backup-subdirectories).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`RESTORE DATABASE` can only be used if the entire database was backed up.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Restore a table

To restore a single table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESTORE TABLE bank.customers FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

To restore multiple tables:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESTORE TABLE bank.customers, bank.accounts FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

To view the available subdirectories, use [`SHOW BACKUPS`](#view-the-backup-subdirectories).

### Restore from incremental backups

To restore the most recent [incremental backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups) from a location containing the full and incremental backup:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESTORE DATABASE bank FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}/{path/to/backup-collection}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}';
~~~

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/backups/no-incremental-restore.md %}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
 `RESTORE` will re-validate [indexes](indexes.html) when [incremental backups](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) are created from an older version (v20.2.2 and earlier or v20.1.4 and earlier), but restored by a newer version (v21.1.0+). These earlier releases may have included incomplete data for indexes that were in the process of being created.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Restore a backup asynchronously

Use the `DETACHED` [option](#options) to execute the restore [job](show-jobs.html) asynchronously:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESTORE FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}'
WITH DETACHED;
~~~

The job ID is returned after the restore job creation completes: 

~~~
        job_id
----------------------
  592786066399264769
(1 row)
~~~

**Without** the `DETACHED` option, `RESTORE` will block the SQL connection until the job completes. Once finished, the job status and more detailed job data is returned:

~~~
job_id             |  status   | fraction_completed | rows | index_entries | bytes
-------------------+-----------+--------------------+------+---------------+--------
652471804772712449 | succeeded |                  1 |   50 |             0 |  4911
(1 row)
~~~

### Other restore usages

#### Restore tables into a different database

By default, tables and views are restored to the database they originally belonged to. However, using the [`into_db` option](#into_db), you can control the target database. Note that the target database must exist prior to the restore. 

First, create the new database that you'll restore the table or view into:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE newdb;
~~~

Next, restore the table into the newly created database with `into_db`:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESTORE bank.customers FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}'
WITH into_db = 'newdb';
~~~

#### Remove the foreign key before restore

By default, tables with [foreign key](foreign-key.html) constraints must be restored at the same time as the tables they reference. However, using the [`skip_missing_foreign_keys`](restore.html#skip_missing_foreign_keys) option you can remove the foreign key constraint from the table and then restore it.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESTORE bank.accounts FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}'
WITH skip_missing_foreign_keys;

#### Restoring users from `system.users` backup

The `system.users` table stores your cluster's usernames and their hashed passwords. To restore them, you must restore the `system.users` table into a new database because you cannot drop the existing `system.users` table.

After it's restored into a new database, you can write the restored `users` table data to the cluster's existing `system.users` table.

First, create the new database that you'll restore the `system.users` table into:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE newdb;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESTORE system.users FROM LATEST IN 's3://{bucket_name}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={key_id}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={access_key}'
WITH into_db = 'newdb';
~~~

After the restore completes, add the `users` to the existing `system.users` table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO system.users SELECT * FROM newdb.users;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> DROP TABLE newdb.users;
~~~

## Known limitations

- To successfully [restore a table into a multi-region database](#restoring-to-multi-region-databases), it is necessary for the order and regions to match between the source and destination database. See the [Known Limitations](known-limitations.html#using-restore-with-multi-region-table-localities) page for detail on ordering and matching regions. [Tracking GitHub Issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/71071)
