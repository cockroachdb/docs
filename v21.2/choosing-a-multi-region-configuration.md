This page has high-level information about how to configure a [multi-region cluster's](multiregion-overview.html) [survival goals](multiregion-overview.html#survival-goals) and [table locality](multiregion-overview.html#table-locality).

{% include enterprise-feature.md %}

The options for configuring your multi-region cluster include:

- _Change nothing_: Using the [default settings](multiregion-overview.html#default-settings), you get:
  - Zone survival (the default).
  - Low-latency reads and writes from a single region.
  - Low-latency stale reads from all other regions.

- _Change only [survival goals](multiregion-overview.html#survival-goals)_: This configuration is useful for single-region apps that need higher levels of survival. In this configuration, you move from availability zone (AZ) survival to get:
  - Region survival.
  - Low-latency reads from a single region.
  - Low-latency stale reads from all other regions.
  - Higher-latency writes from all regions (due to region survival).

- _Change only [table locality](multiregion-overview.html#table-locality)_: This is useful for multi-region apps that require different read/write latency guarantees for different tables in the database, and are not concerned with surviving a region failure. In this configuration, you get:
  - Zone survival (the default).
  - For [global tables](multiregion-overview.html#global-tables), low-latency reads from all regions.
  - For [regional by row tables](multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables), low-latency reads and writes from each row's [home region](set-locality.html#crdb_region), and low-latency [follower reads](follower-reads.html) from all other regions.

- _Change both [survival goals](multiregion-overview.html#survival-goals) and [table locality](multiregion-overview.html#table-locality)_: This is useful for multi-region apps that want a high level of survival. In this configuration, you move from zone survival and get:
  - Region survival.
  - Low-latency reads from all regions.
  - Higher-latency writes from all regions (due to region survival).

The following table offers another view of how the various configuration options map to:

- The performance characteristics of specific survival goal and table locality combinations.
- The types of applications that can benefit from each combination.

| `REGIONAL BY TABLE`                                                 | Low-latency for single-region writes and multi-region stale reads.                                                                     | Single-region writes are higher latency than for `ZONE`, as at least one additional region must be consulted for each write.  Stale multi-region reads are of comparable latency to `ZONE` survival.                     |

| `REGIONAL BY ROW`                                                   | Low-latency consistent multi-region reads and writes for rows that are homed in specific regions.                                       | Low-latency consistent reads from a row's home region. Low-latency consistent [stale reads](follower-reads.html) from outside the row's home region. Low-latency writes if you are writing to a row from its home region.  |
|                                                                     | For multi-region apps that read and write individual rows of the table from a specific region, and can accept the risk of region failure. | Same as for `ZONE` survival, but for apps that must survive a region failure.                                                                                                                                          |

Writes are higher latency than reads.                                                                  | Low-latency multi-region reads.  Writes are higher latency than reads. There should be minimal difference in write latencies between `ZONE` and `REGION` survival due to a new custom non-blocking transaction protocol. |

Different databases and tables within the same cluster can each use different combinations of these settings.
