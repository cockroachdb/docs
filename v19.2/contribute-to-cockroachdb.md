We made CockroachDB source-available to empower developers to fix and
extend the product to better meet their needs. Nothing thrills us more
than people so passionate about the product that theyâ€˜re willing to
spend their own time to learn the codebase and give back to the
community.

Our contributor guide is available in a public-facing wiki at
[wiki.crdb.io](https://wiki.crdb.io/wiki/spaces/CRDB/pages/73204033/Contributing+to+CockroachDB).
