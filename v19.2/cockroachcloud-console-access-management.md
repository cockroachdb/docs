## Roles

Every CockroachCloud user is either a Developer or a Console Admin.

### Developer

A Developer is a limited-access role. A Developer cannot invite Team Members to the Console or access databases.

To access a database, you need to ask a Console Admin for details of a SQL user. To find out who's your Console Admin, check the **Access** page.

### Console Admin

A Console Admin is an all-access role. A Console Admin can perform the following tasks:

- [Invite Team Members to CockroachDB Cloud](#invite-team-members-to-cockroachcloud)
- [Manage Team Members](#manage-team-members)
- [Create and manage SQL users](cockroachcloud-connect-to-your-cluster.html#step-2-create-a-sql-user)

## Administrative tasks

### Invite Team Members to CockroachCloud

To invite Team Members to CockroachCloud:

### Manage Team Members

2. In the **Action** column, click the three dots to view the allowed actions.

As a Console Admin, you can change your own access to a Developer role; however, you won't be able to change yourself back to the Admin role. If you are the only Team Member with Console Admin access, you won't be allowed to change your role until you assign another Team Member to be the Console Admin.
