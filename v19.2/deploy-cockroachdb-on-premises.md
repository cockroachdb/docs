This tutorial shows you how to manually deploy a secure multi-node CockroachDB cluster on multiple machines, using [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) load balancers to distribute client traffic.

If you are only testing CockroachDB, or you are not concerned with protecting network communication with TLS encryption, you can use an insecure cluster instead. Select **Insecure** above for instructions.

## Before you begin

### Requirements

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-requirements.md %}

### Recommendations

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-recommendations.md %}

## Step 1. Synchronize clocks

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/synchronize-clocks.md %}

## Step 2. Generate certificates

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-generate-certificates.md %}

## Step 3. Start nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-start-nodes.md %}

## Step 4. Initialize the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-initialize-cluster.md %}

## Step 5. Test the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-test-cluster.md %}

## Step 6. Set up load balancing

Each CockroachDB node is an equally suitable SQL gateway to your cluster, but to ensure client performance and reliability, it's important to use load balancing:

- **Performance:** Load balancers spread client traffic across nodes. This prevents any one node from being overwhelmed by requests and improves overall cluster performance (queries per second).

- **Reliability:** Load balancers decouple client health from the health of a single CockroachDB node. In cases where a node fails, the load balancer redirects client traffic to available nodes.
  {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}With a single load balancer, client connections are resilient to node failure, but the load balancer itself is a point of failure. It's therefore best to make load balancing resilient as well by using multiple load balancing instances, with a mechanism like floating IPs or DNS to select load balancers for clients.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

[HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) is one of the most popular open-source TCP load balancers, and CockroachDB includes a built-in command for generating a configuration file that is preset to work with your running cluster, so we feature that tool here.

1. On your local machine, run the [`cockroach gen haproxy`](generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) command with the `--host` flag set to the address of any node and security flags pointing to the CA cert and the client cert and key:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ shell
  	$ cockroach gen haproxy \
  	--certs-dir=certs \
  	--host=<address of any node>
  	~~~

      {% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/haproxy.md %}

2. Upload the `haproxy.cfg` file to the machine where you want to run HAProxy:

	{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ shell
	$ scp haproxy.cfg <username>@<haproxy address>:~/
	~~~

3. SSH to the machine where you want to run HAProxy.

4. Install HAProxy:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ shell
	$ apt-get install haproxy
	~~~

5. Start HAProxy, with the `-f` flag pointing to the `haproxy.cfg` file:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ shell
	$ haproxy -f haproxy.cfg
	~~~

6. Repeat these steps for each additional instance of HAProxy you want to run.

## Step 7. Run a sample workload

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-test-load-balancing.md %}

## Step 8. Monitor the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/monitor-cluster.md %}

## Step 9. Scale the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/secure-scale-cluster.md %}

## Step 10. Use the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/use-cluster.md %}
