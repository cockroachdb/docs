## Multi-row DML best practices

### Use multi-row DML instead of multiple single-row DMLs

For `INSERT`, `UPSERT`, and `DELETE` statements, a single multi-row DML is faster than multiple single-row DMLs. Whenever possible, use multi-row DML instead of multiple single-row DMLs.

For more information, see:

- [Insert Multiple Rows](insert.html#insert-multiple-rows-into-an-existing-table)
- [Upsert Multiple Rows](upsert.html#upsert-multiple-rows)
- [Delete Multiple Rows](delete.html#delete-specific-rows)
- [How to improve IoT application performance with multi-row DML](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/multi-row-dml/)

### Use `TRUNCATE` instead of `DELETE` to delete all rows in a table

The [`TRUNCATE`](truncate.html) statement removes all rows from a table by dropping the table and recreating a new table with the same name. This performs better than using `DELETE`, which performs multiple transactions to delete all rows. For smaller tables (with less than 1000 rows), however, using a [`DELETE` statement without a `WHERE` clause](delete.html#delete-all-rows) will be more performant than using `TRUNCATE`.

## Bulk insert best practices

### Use multi-row `INSERT` statements for bulk inserts into existing tables

To bulk-insert data into an existing table, batch multiple rows in one multi-row `INSERT` statement and do not include the `INSERT` statements within a transaction. Experimentally determine the optimal batch size for your application by monitoring the performance for different batch sizes (10 rows, 100 rows, 1000 rows). For more information, see [Insert Multiple Rows](insert.html#insert-multiple-rows-into-an-existing-table).

### Use `IMPORT` instead of `INSERT` for bulk inserts into new tables

To bulk-insert data into a brand new table, the [`IMPORT`](import.html) statement performs better than `INSERT`.

## Bulk deletion best practices

To get the best performance when deleting large amounts of data, follow the instructions in [Why are my deletes getting slower over time?](sql-faqs.html#why-are-my-deletes-getting-slower-over-time).

## Assign column families

A column family is a group of columns in a table that is stored as a single key-value pair in the underlying key-value store.

When a table is created, all columns are stored as a single column family. This default approach ensures efficient key-value storage and performance in most cases. However, when frequently updated columns are grouped with seldom updated columns, the seldom updated columns are nonetheless rewritten on every update. Especially when the seldom updated columns are large, it's therefore more performant to [assign them to a distinct column family](column-families.html).

## Interleave tables

[Interleaving tables](interleave-in-parent.html) improves query performance by optimizing the key-value structure of closely related tables, attempting to keep data on the same key-value range if it's likely to be read and written together. This is particularly helpful if the tables are frequently joined on the columns that consist of the interleaving relationship.

However, the above is only true for tables where all operations (e.g., [`SELECT`](selection-queries.html) or [`INSERT`](insert.html)) are performed on a single value shared between both tables. The following types of operations may actually become slower after interleaving:

- Operations that span multiple values.
- Operations that do not specify the interleaved parent ID.

This happens because when data is interleaved, queries that work on the parent table(s) will need to "skip over" the data in interleaved children, which increases the read and write latencies to the parent in proportion to the number of interleaved values.

## Unique ID best practices

The best practices for generating unique IDs in a distributed database like CockroachDB are very different than for a legacy single-node database. Traditional approaches for generating unique IDs for legacy single-node databases include:

1. Using the [`SERIAL`](serial.html) pseudo-type for a column to generate random unique IDs. This can result in a performance bottleneck because IDs generated temporally near each other have similar values and are located physically near each other in a table's storage.
2. Generating monotonically increasing [`INT`](int.html) IDs by using transactions with roundtrip [`SELECT`](select.html)s, e.g. `INSERT INTO tbl (id, …) VALUES ((SELECT max(id)+1 FROM tbl), …)`. This has a **very high performance cost** since it makes all [`INSERT`](insert.html) transactions wait for their turn to insert the next ID. You should only do this if your application really does require strict ID ordering. In some cases, using [Change Data Capture (CDC)](change-data-capture.html) can help avoid the requirement for strict ID ordering. If you can avoid the requirement for strict ID ordering, you can use one of the higher performance ID strategies outlined below.

The approaches described above are likely to create hotspots for both reads and writes in CockroachDB. To avoid this issue, we recommend the following approaches (listed in order from best to worst performance).

| Approach                                                                             | Pros                                             | Cons                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. [Use multi-column primary keys](#use-multi-column-primary-keys)                   | Potentially fastest, if done right               | Complex, requires up-front design and testing to ensure performance                     |
| 2. [Use `UUID` to generate unique IDs](#use-uuid-to-generate-unique-ids)             | Good performance; spreads load well; easy choice | May leave some performance on the table; requires other columns to be useful in queries |
| 3. [Use `INSERT` with the `RETURNING` clause](#use-insert-with-the-returning-clause-to-generate-unique-ids) | Easy to query against; familiar design           | Slower performance than the other options; higher chance of transaction contention      |

### Use multi-column primary keys

A well-designed multi-column primary key can yield even better performance than a [UUID primary key](#use-uuid-to-generate-unique-ids), but it requires more up-front schema design work. To get the best performance, ensure that any monotonically increasing field is located **after** the first column of the primary key. When done right, such a composite primary key should result in:

- Enough randomness in your primary key to spread the table data / query load relatively evenly across the cluster, which will avoid hotspots. By "enough randomness" we mean that the prefix of the primary key should be relatively uniformly distributed over its domain. Its domain should have at least as many elements as you have nodes.
- A monotonically increasing column that is part of the primary key (and thus indexed) which is also useful in your queries.

For example, consider a social media website. Social media posts are written by users, and on login the user's last 10 posts are displayed. A good choice for a primary key might be `(username, post_timestamp)`. For example:

~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE posts (
    username STRING,
    post_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    post_id INT,
    post_content STRING,
    CONSTRAINT posts_pk PRIMARY KEY(username, post_timestamp)
);
~~~

This would make the following query efficient.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM posts
          WHERE username = 'alyssa'
       ORDER BY post_timestamp DESC
          LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
  username |      post_timestamp       | post_id | post_content
+----------+---------------------------+---------+--------------+
  alyssa   | 2019-07-31 18:01:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  alyssa   | 2019-07-30 10:22:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  alyssa   | 2019-07-30 09:12:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  alyssa   | 2019-07-29 13:48:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  alyssa   | 2019-07-29 13:47:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  alyssa   | 2019-07-29 13:46:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  alyssa   | 2019-07-29 13:43:00+00:00 |    ...  | ...
  ...

Time: 924µs
~~~

To see why, let's look at the [`EXPLAIN`](explain.html) output. It shows that the query is fast because it does a point lookup on the indexed column `username` (as shown by the line `spans | /"alyssa"-...`). Furthermore, the column `post_timestamp` is already in an index, and sorted (since it's a monotonically increasing part of the primary key).

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)
    SELECT * FROM posts
            WHERE username = 'alyssa'
         ORDER BY post_timestamp DESC
            LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
   tree   | field |          description          |          columns           |    ordering
+---------+-------+-------------------------------+----------------------------+-----------------+
  revscan |       |                               | (username, post_timestamp) | -post_timestamp
          | table | posts@posts_pk                |                            |
          | spans | /"alyssa"-/"alyssa"/PrefixEnd |                            |
          | limit | 10                            |                            |
(4 rows)

Time: 818µs
~~~

Note that the above query also follows the [indexing best practice](indexes.html#best-practices) of indexing all columns in the `WHERE` clause.

### Use `UUID` to generate unique IDs

To auto-generate unique row IDs, use the [`UUID`](uuid.html) column with the `gen_random_uuid()` [function](functions-and-operators.html#id-generation-functions) as the [default value](default-value.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE t1 (id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), name STRING);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO t1 (name) VALUES ('a'), ('b'), ('c');
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM t1;
~~~

~~~
+--------------------------------------+------+
|                  id                  | name |
+--------------------------------------+------+
| 60853a85-681d-4620-9677-946bbfdc8fbc | c    |
| 77c9bc2e-76a5-4ebc-80c3-7ad3159466a1 | b    |
| bd3a56e1-c75e-476c-b221-0da9d74d66eb | a    |
+--------------------------------------+------+
(3 rows)
~~~

### Use `INSERT` with the `RETURNING` clause to generate unique IDs

If something prevents you from using [multi-column primary keys](#use-multi-column-primary-keys) or [`UUID`s](#use-uuid-to-generate-unique-ids) to generate unique IDs, you might resort to using `INSERT`s with `SELECT`s to return IDs. Instead, [use the `RETURNING` clause with the `INSERT` statement](insert.html#insert-and-return-values) as shown below for improved performance.

#### Generate monotonically-increasing unique IDs

Suppose the table schema is as follows:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE X (
	ID1 INT,
	ID2 INT,
	ID3 INT DEFAULT 1,
	PRIMARY KEY (ID1,ID2)
  );
~~~

The common approach would be to use a transaction with an `INSERT` followed by a `SELECT`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BEGIN;

> INSERT INTO X VALUES (1,1,1)
  	ON CONFLICT (ID1,ID2)
  	DO UPDATE SET ID3=X.ID3+1;

> SELECT * FROM X WHERE ID1=1 AND ID2=1;

> COMMIT;
~~~

However, the performance best practice is to use a `RETURNING` clause with `INSERT` instead of the transaction:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO X VALUES (1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)
	ON CONFLICT (ID1,ID2)
	DO UPDATE SET ID3=X.ID3 + 1
	RETURNING ID1,ID2,ID3;
~~~

#### Generate random unique IDs

Suppose the table schema is as follows:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE X (
	ID1 INT,
	ID2 INT,
	ID3 INT DEFAULT unique_rowid(),
	PRIMARY KEY (ID1,ID2)
  );
~~~

The common approach to generate random Unique IDs is a transaction using a `SELECT` statement:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BEGIN;

> INSERT INTO X VALUES (1,1);

> SELECT * FROM X WHERE ID1=1 AND ID2=1;

> COMMIT;
~~~

However, the performance best practice is to use a `RETURNING` clause with `INSERT` instead of the transaction:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO X VALUES (1,1),(2,2),(3,3)
	RETURNING ID1,ID2,ID3;
~~~

## Indexes best practices

### Use secondary indexes

You can use [secondary indexes](indexes.html) to improve the performance of queries using columns not in a table's primary key. You can create them:

- At the same time as the table with the `INDEX` clause of [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.html#create-a-table-with-secondary-and-inverted-indexes). In addition to explicitly defined indexes, CockroachDB automatically creates secondary indexes for columns with the [`UNIQUE` constraint](unique.html).
- For existing tables with [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index.html).
- By applying the `UNIQUE` constraint to columns with [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.html), which automatically creates an index of the constrained columns.

To create the most useful secondary indexes, check out our [best practices](indexes.html#best-practices).

### Use indexes for faster joins

See [Join Performance Best Practices](joins.html#performance-best-practices).

### Drop unused indexes

Though indexes improve read performance, they incur an overhead for every write. In some cases, like the use cases discussed above, the tradeoff is worth it. However, if an index is unused, it slows down DML operations. Therefore, [drop unused indexes](drop-index.html) whenever possible.

## Join best practices

See [Join Performance Best Practices](joins.html#performance-best-practices).

## Subquery best practices

See [Subquery Performance Best Practices](subqueries.html#performance-best-practices).

## Table scans best practices

### Avoid `SELECT *` for large tables

For large tables, avoid table scans (that is, reading the entire table data) whenever possible. Instead, define the required fields in a `SELECT` statement.

#### Example

Suppose the table schema is as follows:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE accounts (
	id INT,
	customer STRING,
	address STRING,
	balance INT
	nominee STRING
	);
~~~

Now if we want to find the account balances of all customers, an inefficient table scan would be:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM ACCOUNTS;
~~~

This query retrieves all data stored in the table. A more efficient query would be:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
 > SELECT CUSTOMER, BALANCE FROM ACCOUNTS;
~~~

This query returns the account balances of the customers.

### Avoid `SELECT DISTINCT` for large tables

`SELECT DISTINCT` allows you to obtain unique entries from a query by removing duplicate entries. However, `SELECT DISTINCT` is computationally expensive. As a performance best practice, use [`SELECT` with the `WHERE` clause](select-clause.html#filter-rows) instead.

### Use `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` to decrease conflicts with long-running queries

If you have long-running queries (such as analytics queries that perform full table scans) that can tolerate slightly out-of-date reads, consider using the [`... AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clause](select-clause.html#select-historical-data-time-travel). Using this, your query returns data as it appeared at a distinct point in the past and will not cause [conflicts](architecture/transaction-layer.html#transaction-conflicts) with other concurrent transactions, which can increase your application's performance.

However, because `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` returns historical data, your reads might be stale.

## Understanding and avoiding transaction contention

Transaction contention occurs when the following three conditions are met:

- There are multiple concurrent transactions or statements (sent by
  multiple clients connected simultaneously to a single CockroachDB
  cluster).
- They operate on the same data, specifically over table rows with the
  same index key values (either on [primary keys](primary-key.html) or
  secondary [indexes](indexes.html), or via
  [interleaving](interleave-in-parent.html)) or using index key values
  that are close to each other, and thus place the indexed data on the
  same [data ranges](architecture/overview.html).
- At least some of the transactions write or modify the data.

A set of transactions that all contend on the same keys will be
limited in performance to the maximum processing speed of a single
node (limited horizontal scalability). Non-contended transactions are
not affected in this way.

There are two levels of contention:

- Transactions that operate on the same range but different index key
  values will be limited by the overall hardware capacity of a single
  node (the range lease holder).

- Transactions that operate on the same index key values
  (specifically, that operate on the same [column
  family](column-families.html) for a given index key) will be more
  strictly serialized to obey transaction isolation semantics.

Transaction contention can also increase the rate of transaction
restarts, and thus make the proper implementation of [client-side
transaction
retries](transactions.html#client-side-intervention) more
critical.

To avoid contention, multiple strategies can be applied:

- Use index key values with a more random distribution of values, so
  that transactions over different rows are more likely to operate on
  separate data ranges. See the [SQL FAQs](sql-faqs.html) on row IDs for
  suggestions.

- Make transactions smaller, so that each transaction has less work to
  do. In particular, avoid multiple client-server exchanges per
  transaction. For example, use [common table
  expressions](common-table-expressions.html) to group multiple
  [`SELECT`](select-clause.html) and
  [`INSERT`](insert.html)/[`UPDATE`](update.html)/[`DELETE`](delete.html)/[`UPSERT`](upsert.html)
  clauses together in a single SQL statement.

- When replacing values in a row, use [`UPSERT`](upsert.html) and
  specify values for all columns in the inserted rows. This will
  usually have the best performance under contention, compared to
  combinations of [`SELECT`](select-clause.html),
  [`INSERT`](insert.html), and [`UPDATE`](update.html).

- Increase
  [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)
  of the data to place parts of the same records that are modified by
  different transactions in different tables. Note however that this
  is a double-edged sword, because denormalization can also increase
  performance by creating multiple copies of often-referenced data in
  separate ranges.

- If the application strictly requires operating on very few different
  index key values, consider using [`ALTER ... SPLIT
  AT`](split-at.html) so that each index key value can be served by
  a separate group of nodes in the cluster.

It is always best to avoid contention as much as possible via the
design of the schema and application. However, sometimes contention is
unavoidable. To maximize performance in the presence of contention,
you'll need to maximize the performance of a single range.
To achieve this, multiple strategies can be applied:

- Minimize the network distance between the replicas of a range,
  possibly using zone configs and partitioning.
- Use the fastest storage devices available.
- If the contending transactions operate on different keys within the
  same range, add more CPU power (more cores) per node. Note however
  that this is less likely to provide an improvement if the
  transactions all operate on the same key.
