title: cockroach start-single-node
summary: Start a single-node cluster for app development.
toc: true
---

<span class="version-tag">New in v19.2:</span> This page explains the `cockroach start-single-node` [command](cockroach-commands.html), which you use to start a single-node cluster with replication disabled. A single-node cluster is all you need for quick SQL testing or app development.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To run a multi-node cluster with replicated data for availability and consistency, use [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach init`](cockroach-init.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Synopsis

Start a single-node cluster:

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start-single-node <flags>
~~~

View help:

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start-single-node --help
~~~

## Flags

The `cockroach start-single-node` command supports the following [general-use](#general), [networking](#networking), [security](#security), and [logging](#logging) flags.

Many flags have useful defaults that can be overridden by specifying the flags explicitly. If you specify flags explicitly, however, be sure to do so each time the node is restarted, as they will not be remembered.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The `cockroach start-single-node` flags are identical to [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html#flags) flags. However, many of them are not relevant for single-node clusters but are provided for users who want to test concepts that appear in multi-node clusters. These flags are called out as such. In most cases, accepting most defaults is sufficient (see the [examples](#examples) below).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### General

Flag | Description
-----|-----------
`--attrs` | **Not relevant for single-node clusters.** Arbitrary strings, separated by colons, specifying node capability, which might include specialized hardware or number of cores, for example:<br><br>`--attrs=ram:64gb`<br><br>These can be used to influence the location of data replicas. See [Configure Replication Zones](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) for full details.
`--background` | Set this to start the node in the background. This is better than appending `&` to the command because control is returned to the shell only once the node is ready to accept requests. <br /><br /> **Note:** `--background` is suitable for writing automated test suites or maintenance procedures that need a temporary server process running in the background. It is not intended to be used to start a long-running server, because it does not fully detach from the controlling terminal. Consider using a service manager or a tool like [daemon(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=daemon&sektion=8) instead.
`--cache` | The total size for caches, shared evenly if there are multiple storage devices. This can be a percentage (notated as a decimal or with `%`) or any bytes-based unit, for example: <br><br>`--cache=.25`<br>`--cache=25%`<br>`--cache=1000000000 ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--cache=1GB ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--cache=1GiB ----> 1073741824 bytes` <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the `%` notation, you might need to escape the `%` sign, for instance, while configuring CockroachDB through `systemd` service files. For this reason, it's recommended to use the decimal notation instead.<br><br>**Default:** `128MiB`<br><br>The default cache size is reasonable for local development clusters. For production deployments, this should be increased to 25% or higher. See [Recommended Production Settings](recommended-production-settings.html#cache-and-sql-memory-size) for more details.
`--external-io-dir` | The path of the external IO directory with which the local file access paths are prefixed while performing backup and restore operations using local node directories or NFS drives. If set to `disabled`, backups and restores using local node directories and NFS drives are disabled.<br><br>**Default:** `extern` subdirectory of the first configured [`store`](#store).<br><br>To set the `--external-io-dir` flag to the locations you want to use without needing to restart nodes, create symlinks to the desired locations from within the `extern` directory.
`--listening-url-file` | The file to which the node's SQL connection URL will be written on successful startup, in addition to being printed to the [standard output](#standard-output).<br><br>This is particularly helpful in identifying the node's port when an unused port is assigned automatically (`--port=0`).
`--locality` | **Not relevant for single-node clusters.** Arbitrary key-value pairs that describe the location of the node. Locality might include country, region, datacenter, rack, etc. For more details, see [Locality](cockroach-start.html#locality) below.
`--max-disk-temp-storage` | The maximum on-disk storage capacity available to store temporary data for SQL queries that exceed the memory budget (see `--max-sql-memory`). This ensures that JOINs, sorts, and other memory-intensive SQL operations are able to spill intermediate results to disk. This can be a percentage (notated as a decimal or with `%`) or any bytes-based unit (e.g., `.25`, `25%`, `500GB`, `1TB`, `1TiB`).<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the `%` notation, you might need to escape the `%` sign, for instance, while configuring CockroachDB through `systemd` service files. For this reason, it's recommended to use the decimal notation instead. Also, if expressed as a percentage, this value is interpreted relative to the size of the first store. However, the temporary space usage is never counted towards any store usage; therefore, when setting this value, it's important to ensure that the size of this temporary storage plus the size of the first store doesn't exceed the capacity of the storage device.<br><br>The temporary files are located in the path specified by the `--temp-dir` flag, or in the subdirectory of the first store (see `--store`) by default.<br><br>**Default:** `32GiB`
`--max-sql-memory` | The maximum in-memory storage capacity available to store temporary data for SQL queries, including prepared queries and intermediate data rows during query execution. This can be a percentage (notated as a decimal or with `%`) or any bytes-based unit, for example:<br><br>`--max-sql-memory=.25`<br>`--max-sql-memory=25%`<br>`--max-sql-memory=10000000000 ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--max-sql-memory=1GB ----> 1000000000 bytes`<br>`--max-sql-memory=1GiB ----> 1073741824 bytes`<br><br>The temporary files are located in the path specified by the `--temp-dir` flag, or in the subdirectory of the first store (see `--store`) by default.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the `%` notation, you might need to escape the `%` sign, for instance, while configuring CockroachDB through `systemd` service files. For this reason, it's recommended to use the decimal notation instead.<br><br>**Default:** `128MiB`<br><br>The default SQL memory size is reasonable for local development clusters. For production deployments, this should be increased to 25% or higher. See [Recommended Production Settings](recommended-production-settings.html#cache-and-sql-memory-size) for more details.
`--pid-file` | The file to which the node's process ID will be written on successful startup. When this flag is not set, the process ID is not written to file.
`--store`<br>`-s` | The file path to a storage device and, optionally, store attributes and maximum size. When using multiple storage devices for a node, this flag must be specified separately for each device, for example: <br><br>`--store=/mnt/ssd01 --store=/mnt/ssd02` <br><br>For more details, see [Store](#store) below.
`--temp-dir` | The path of the node's temporary store directory. On node start up, the location for the temporary files is printed to the standard output. <br><br>**Default:** Subdirectory of the first [store](#store)

### Networking

Flag | Description
-----|-----------
`--listen-addr` | The IP address/hostname and port to listen on for connections from clients. For IPv6, use the notation `[...]`, e.g., `[::1]` or `[fe80::f6f2:::]`.<br><br>**Default:** Listen on all IP addresses on port `26257`
`--http-addr` | The IP address/hostname and port to listen on for Admin UI HTTP requests. For IPv6, use the notation `[...]`, e.g., `[::1]:8080` or `[fe80::f6f2:::]:8080`.<br><br>**Default:** Listen on the address part of `--listen-addr` on port `8080`

### Security

Flag | Description
-----|-----------
`--certs-dir` | The path to the [certificate directory](cockroach-cert.html). The directory must contain valid certificates if running in secure mode.<br><br>**Default:** `${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/`
`--insecure` | Run in insecure mode. If this flag is not set, the `--certs-dir` flag must point to valid certificates.<br><br><strong>Note the following risks:</strong> An insecure cluster is open to any client that can access any node's IP addresses; any user, even `root`, can log in without providing a password; any user, connecting as `root`, can read or write any data in your cluster; and there is no network encryption or authentication, and thus no confidentiality.<br><br>**Default:** `false`
`--enterprise-encryption` | This optional flag specifies the encryption options for one of the stores on the node. If multiple stores exist, the flag must be specified for each store. <br /><br /> This flag takes a number of options.  For a complete list of options, and usage instructions, see [Encryption at Rest](encryption.html). <br /><br /> Note that this is an [enterprise feature](enterprise-licensing.html).   

### Store

The `--store` flag supports the following fields. Note that commas are used to separate fields, and so are forbidden in all field values.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
In-memory storage is not suitable for production deployments at this time.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Field | Description
------|------------
`type` | For in-memory storage, set this field to `mem`; otherwise, leave this field out. The `path` field must not be set when `type=mem`.
`path` | The file path to the storage device. When not setting `attr` or `size`, the `path` field label can be left out: <br><br>`--store=/mnt/ssd01` <br><br>When either of those fields are set, however, the `path` field label must be used: <br><br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GB` <br><br> **Default:** `cockroach-data`
`attrs` | Arbitrary strings, separated by colons, specifying disk type or capability. These can be used to influence the location of data replicas. See [Configure Replication Zones](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) for full details.<br><br>In most cases, node-level `--locality` or `--attrs` are preferable to store-level attributes, but this field can be used to match capabilities for storage of individual databases or tables. For example, an OLTP database would probably want to allocate space for its tables only on solid state devices, whereas append-only time series might prefer cheaper spinning drives. Typical attributes include whether the store is flash (`ssd`) or spinny disk (`hdd`), as well as speeds and other specs, for example:<br><br> `--store=path=/mnt/hda1,attrs=hdd:7200rpm`
`size` | The maximum size allocated to the node. When this size is reached, CockroachDB attempts to rebalance data to other nodes with available capacity. When there's no capacity elsewhere, this limit will be exceeded. Also, data may be written to the node faster than the cluster can rebalance it away; in this case, as long as capacity is available elsewhere, CockroachDB will gradually rebalance data down to the store limit.<br><br> The `size` can be specified either in a bytes-based unit or as a percentage of hard drive space (notated as a decimal or with `%`), for example: <br><br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=10000000000 ----> 10000000000 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GB ----> 20000000000 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GiB ----> 21474836480 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.02TiB ----> 21474836480 bytes`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20% ----> 20% of available space`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.2 ----> 20% of available space`<br>`--store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=.2 ----> 20% of available space`<br><br>**Default:** 100%<br><br>For an in-memory store, the `size` field is required and must be set to the true maximum bytes or percentage of available memory, for example:<br><br>`--store=type=mem,size=20GB`<br>`--store=type=mem,size=90%`<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the `%` notation, you might need to escape the `%` sign, for instance, while configuring CockroachDB through `systemd` service files. For this reason, it's recommended to use the decimal notation instead.

### Logging

By default, `cockroach start-single-node` writes all messages to log files, and prints nothing to `stderr`. However, you can control the process's [logging](debug-and-error-logs.html) behavior with the following flags:

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/logging-flags.md %}

#### Defaults

`cockroach start-single-node` uses the equivalent values for these logging flags by default:

- `--log-dir=<first store dir>/logs`
- `--logtostderr=NONE`

This means, by default, CockroachDB writes all messages to log files, and never prints to `stderr`.

## Standard output

When you run `cockroach start-single-node`, some helpful details are printed to the standard output:

~~~ shell
CockroachDB node starting at {{page.release_info.start_time}}
build:               CCL {{page.release_info.version}} @ {{page.release_info.build_time}} (go1.12.6)

~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
These details are also written to the `INFO` log in the `/logs` directory. You can retrieve them with a command like `grep 'node starting' node1/logs/cockroach.log -A 11`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Field | Description
------|------------
`build` | The version of CockroachDB you are running.
`webui` | The URL for accessing the Admin UI.
`sql` | The connection URL for your client.
`RPC client flags` | The flags to use when connecting to the node via [`cockroach` client commands](cockroach-commands.html).
`logs` | The directory containing debug log data.
`temp dir` | The temporary store directory of the node.
`external I/O path` | The external IO directory with which the local file access paths are prefixed while performing [backup](backup.html) and [restore](restore.html) operations using local node directories or NFS drives.
`attrs` | If node-level attributes were specified in the `--attrs` flag, they are listed in this field. These details are potentially useful for [configuring replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html).
`locality` | If values describing the locality of the node were specified in the `--locality` field, they are listed in this field. These details are potentially useful for [configuring replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html).
`store[n]` | The directory containing store data, where `[n]` is the index of the store, e.g., `store[0]` for the first store, `store[1]` for the second store.<br><br>If store-level attributes were specified in the `attrs` field of the [`--store`](#store) flag, they are listed in this field as well. These details are potentially useful for [configuring replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html).
`status` | Whether the node is the first in the cluster (`initialized new cluster`), joined an existing cluster for the first time (`initialized new node, joined pre-existing cluster`), or rejoined an existing cluster (`restarted pre-existing node`).
`clusterID` | The ID of the cluster.<br><br>When trying to join a node to an existing cluster, if this ID is different than the ID of the existing cluster, the node has started a new cluster. This may be due to conflicting information in the node's data directory. For additional guidance, see the [troubleshooting](common-errors.html#node-belongs-to-cluster-cluster-id-but-is-attempting-to-connect-to-a-gossip-network-for-cluster-another-cluster-id) docs.
`nodeID` | The ID of the node.

1. Create two directories for certificates:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ mkdir certs my-safe-directory
    ~~~

    Directory | Description
    ----------|------------
    `certs` | You'll generate your CA certificate and all node and client certificates and keys in this directory.
    `my-safe-directory` | You'll generate your CA key in this directory and then reference the key when generating node and client certificates.

2. Create the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate and key pair:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach cert create-ca \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
    ~~~

3. Create the certificate and key pair for the node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach cert create-node \
    localhost \
    $(hostname) \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
    ~~~

4. Create a client certificate and key pair for the `root` user:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach cert create-client \
    root \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
    ~~~

5. Start the single-node cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start-single-node \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26257 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8080 \

</section>

### Scale to multiple nodes

Scaling a cluster started with `cockroach start-single-node` involves restarting the first node with the `cockroach start` command instead, and then adding new nodes with that command as well, all using a `--join` flag that forms them into a single multi-node cluster. Since replication is disabled in clusters started with `start-single-node`, you also need to enable replication to get CockroachDB's availability and consistency guarantees.

<section class="filters clearfix">
  <button style="width: 15%" class="filter-button" data-scope="secure">Secure</button>
  <button style="width: 15%" class="filter-button" data-scope="insecure">Insecure</button>
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="secure">
1. Stop the single-node cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

2. Restart the node with the [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) command:  

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26257 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8080 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    The new flag to note is `--join`, which specifies the addresses and ports of the nodes that will comprise your cluster. You'll use this exact `--join` flag when starting other nodes as well.

    {% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/join-flag-single-region.md %}

3. Add two more nodes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --store=node2 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26258 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8081 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --certs-dir=certs \
    --store=node3 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26259 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8082 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    These commands are the same as before but with unique `--store`, `--listen-addr`, and `--http-addr` flags, since this all nodes are running on the same machine. Also, since all nodes use the same hostname (`localhost`), you can use the first node's certificate. Note that this is different than running a production cluster, where you would need to generate a certificate and key for each node, issued to all common names and IP addresses you might use to refer to the node as well as to any load balancer instances.

4. Open the [built-in SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --certs-dir=certs --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

5. Update preconfigured [replication zones](configure-replication-zones.html) to replicate user data 3 times and import internal data 5 times:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER RANGE default CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 3;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER RANGE system CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 5;

    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER RANGE meta CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 5;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER TABLE system.public.jobs CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 5;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > ALTER TABLE system.public.replication_constraint_stats CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 5;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
