toc: true
---

This page walks you through a simple demonstration of how CockroachDB remains available during, and recovers after, failure. Starting with a 6-node local cluster with the default 3-way replication, you'll run a sample workload, stop a node to simulate failure, and see how the cluster continues uninterrupted. You'll then leave that node offline for long enough to watch the cluster repair itself by re-replicating missing data to other nodes. You'll then prepare the cluster for 2 simultaneous node failures by increasing to 5-way replication, then take two nodes offline at the same time, and again see how the cluster continues uninterrupted.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have already [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).

## Step 1. Start a 6-node cluster

1. Use the [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) command to start 6 nodes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node1 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26257 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8080 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node2 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26258 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8081 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node3 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26259 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8082 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node4 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26260 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8083 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node5 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26261 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8084 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node6 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26262 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8085 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

2. Use the [`cockroach init`](cockroach-init.html) command to perform a one-time initialization of the cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach init \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

## Step 2. Set up load balancing

In this module, you'll run a sample workload to simulate multiple client connections. Each node is an equally suitable SQL gateway for the load, but it's always recommended to [spread requests evenly across nodes](recommended-production-settings.html#load-balancing). You'll use the open-source [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) load balancer to do that here.

1. Install HAProxy.

    <div class="filters clearfix">
      <button style="width: 15%" class="filter-button" data-scope="mac">Mac</button>
      <button style="width: 15%" class="filter-button" data-scope="linux">Linux</button>
    </div>
    <p></p>

    <div class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="mac">
    If you're on a Mac and use Homebrew, run:
    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ brew install haproxy
    ~~~
    </div>

    <div class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="linux">
    If you're using Linux and use apt-get, run:
    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ sudo apt-get install haproxy
    ~~~
    </div>

2. Run the [`cockroach gen haproxy`](cockroach-gen.html) command, specifying the port of any node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach gen haproxy \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost \
    --port=26257
    ~~~

    This command generates an `haproxy.cfg` file automatically configured to work with the nodes of your running cluster.

3. In `haproxy.cfg`, change `bind :26257` to `bind :26000`. This changes the port on which HAProxy accepts requests to a port that is not already in use by a node.

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    sed -i.saved 's/^    bind :26257/    bind :26000/' haproxy.cfg
    ~~~

4. Start HAProxy, with the `-f` flag pointing to the `haproxy.cfg` file:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ haproxy -f haproxy.cfg &
    ~~~

## Step 3. Run a sample workload

Now that you have a load balancer running in front of your cluster, use the [`cockroach workload`](cockroach-workload.html) command to run CockroachDB's built-in version of the YCSB benchmark, simulating multiple client connections, each performing mixed read/write operations.

1. Load the initial `ycsb` schema and data, pointing it at HAProxy's port:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach workload init ycsb --splits=50 \
    'postgresql://root@localhost:26000?sslmode=disable'
    ~~~

    The `--splits` flag tells the workload to manually split ranges a number of times. This is not something you'd normally do, but for the purpose of this tutorial, it makes it easier to visualize the movement of data in the cluster.

2. Run the `ycsb` workload, pointing it at HAProxy's port:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach workload run ycsb \
    --duration=20m \
    --concurrency=3 \
    --max-rate=1000 \
    --tolerate-errors \
    'postgresql://root@localhost:26000?sslmode=disable'
    ~~~

    This command initiates 3 concurrent client workloads for 20 minutes, but limits the total load to 1000 operations per second (since you're running everything on a single machine).

    You'll see per-operation statistics print to standard output every second:

    ~~~
    _elapsed___errors__ops/sec(inst)___ops/sec(cum)__p50(ms)__p95(ms)__p99(ms)_pMax(ms)
        1.0s        0          902.8          930.9      1.1      2.1      4.1     62.9 read
        1.0s        0           46.5           48.0      3.4      4.7      6.0      6.0 update
        2.0s        0          923.3          926.9      1.0      2.9      5.5      8.9 read
        2.0s        0           38.0           43.0      3.0      6.0      7.6      7.6 update
        3.0s        0          901.1          918.3      1.1      2.5      5.0      6.6 read
        3.0s        0           55.0           47.0      3.4      7.9      9.4     11.5 update
        4.0s        0          948.9          926.0      1.0      1.6      2.6      5.0 read
        4.0s        0           46.0           46.7      3.1      5.2     16.8     16.8 update
        5.0s        0          932.0          927.2      1.1      1.8      2.9     13.6 read
        5.0s        0           56.0           48.6      3.0      4.2      5.2      5.5 update
    ...
    ~~~

    After the specified duration (20 minutes in this case), the workload will stop and you'll see totals printed to standard output.

## Step 4. Check the workload

Initially, the workload creates a new database called `ycsb`, creates a `usertable` table in that database, and inserts a bunch of rows into the table. Soon, the load generator starts executing approximately 95% reads and 5% writes.

1. Go to the Admin UI at <a href="http://localhost:8080" data-proofer-ignore>http://localhost:8080</a>.

2. To check the SQL queries getting executed, click **Metrics** on the left, and hover over the **SQL Queries** graph at the top:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

3. To check the client connections from the load generator, select the **SQL** dashboard and hover over the **SQL Connections** graph:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    You'll notice 3 client connections from the load generator. If you want to check that HAProxy balanced each connection to a different node, you can change the **Graph** dropdown from **Cluster** to specific nodes.

4. To see more details about the `ycsb` database and `usertable` table, click **Databases** in the upper left and then scroll down until you see **ycsb**:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    You can also view the schema of the `usertable` by clicking the table name:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-4.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />    

5. By default, CockroachDB replicates all data 3 times and balances it across all nodes. To see this balance, click **Overview** and check the replica count across all nodes:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-6.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

## Step 5. Simulate a single node failure

When a node fails, the cluster waits for the node to remain offline for 5 minutes by default before considering it dead, at which point the cluster automatically repairs itself by re-replicating any of the replicas on the down nodes to other available nodes.

1. In a new terminal, [edit the default replication zone](configure-replication-zones.html) to reduce the amount of time the cluster waits before considering a node dead to the minimum allowed of 1 minute and 15 seconds:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26000 \
    --execute="SET CLUSTER SETTING server.time_until_store_dead = '1m15s';"
    ~~~

2. Then use the [`cockroach quit`](cockroach-quit.html) command to stop a node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26261
    ~~~

## Step 6. Check load continuity and cluster health

Go back to the Admin UI, click **Metrics** on the left, and verify that the cluster as a whole continues serving data, despite one of the nodes being unavailable and marked as **Suspect**:

<img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-7.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

This shows that when all ranges are replicated 3 times (the default), the cluster can tolerate a single node failure because the surviving nodes have a majority of each range's replicas (2/3).

## Step 7. Watch the cluster repair itself

Click **Overview** on the left:

<img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-5.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

Because you reduced the time it takes for the cluster to consider the down node dead, after 1 minute or so, the cluster will consider the down node "dead", and you'll see the replica count on the remaining nodes increase and the number of under-replicated ranges decrease to 0. This shows the cluster repairing itself by re-replicating missing replicas.

## Step 8. Prepare for two simultaneous node failures

At this point, the cluster has recovered and is ready to handle another failure. However, the cluster cannot handle two _near-simultaneous_ failures in this configuration. Failures are "near-simultaneous" if they are closer together than the `server.time_until_store_dead` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) plus the time taken for the number of replicas on the dead node to drop to zero. If two failures occurred in this configuration, some ranges would become unavailable until one of the nodes recovers.

To be able to tolerate 2 of 5 nodes failing simultaneously without any service interruption, ranges must be replicated 5 times.

1. Restart the dead node, using the same command you used to start the node initially:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=fault-node5 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26261 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8084 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

2. Use the [`ALTER RANGE ... CONFIGURE ZONE`](configure-zone.html) command to change the cluster's `default` replication factor to 5:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --execute="ALTER RANGE default CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas=5;" --insecure --host=localhost:26000
    ~~~

3. Back in the Admin UI **Overview** dashboard, watch the replica count increases and even out across all 6 nodes:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-8.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    This shows the cluster up-replicating so that each range has 5 replicas, one on each node.

## Step 9. Simulate two simultaneous node failures

Use the [`cockroach quit`](cockroach-quit.html) command to stop two nodes:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26260
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26261
~~~

## Step 10. Check load continuity and cluster health

1. Like before, go to the Admin UI, click **Metrics** on the left, and verify that the cluster as a whole continues serving data, despite 2 nodes being offline:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v19.2/fault-tolerance-9.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    This shows that when all ranges are replicated 5 times, the cluster can tolerate 2 simultaneous node outages because the surviving nodes have a majority of each range's replicas (3/5).

2. To verify this further, use the `cockroach sql` command to count the number of rows in the `ycsb.usertable` table and verify that it is still serving reads:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26257 \
    --execute="SELECT count(*) FROM ycsb.usertable;"
    ~~~

    ~~~
      count
    +-------+
      10000
    (1 row)
    ~~~

    And writes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26257 \
    --execute="INSERT INTO ycsb.usertable VALUES ('asdf', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);"
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26257 \
    --execute="SELECT count(*) FROM ycsb.usertable;"
    ~~~

    ~~~
      count
    +-------+
      10001
    (1 row)
    ~~~

## Step 11. Clean up

1. In the terminal where the YCSB workload is running, press CTRL + c.

2. Terminate HAProxy:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ pkill haproxy
    ~~~

3. Use the [`cockroach quit`](cockroach-quit.html) command to shut down the remaining 4 nodes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    For the final 2 nodes, the shutdown process will take longer (about a minute each) and will eventually force the nodes to stop. This is because, with only 2 of 5 nodes left, a majority of replicas are not available, and so the cluster is no longer operational.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26258
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26259
    ~~~

4. To restart the cluster at a later time, run the same `cockroach start` commands as earlier from the directory containing the nodes' data stores.  

    If you do not plan to restart the cluster, you may want to remove the nodes' data stores and the HAProxy config files:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ rm -rf fault-node1 fault-node2 fault-node3 fault-node4 fault-node5 fault-node6 haproxy.cfg haproxy.cfg.saved
    ~~~
