User authorization is the act of defining access policies for authenticated CockroachDB users. CockroachDB allows you to create, manage, and remove your cluster's [users](#sql-users) and assign SQL-level [privileges](#assign-privileges) to the users. Additionally, if you have an [enterprise license](get-started-with-enterprise-trial.html), you can use [role-based access management (RBAC)](#roles) for simplified user management.

## SQL users

A SQL user can interact with a CockroachDB database using the [built-in SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html) or through an application.

### Create and manage users

Use the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.html) and [`DROP USER`](drop-user.html) statements to create and remove users, the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.html) statement to add or change a user's password, the [`GRANT <privileges>`](grant.html) and [`REVOKE <privileges>`](revoke.html) statements to manage the user’s privileges, and the [`SHOW USERS`](show-users.html) statement to list users.

A new user must be granted the required privileges for each database and table that the user needs to access.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
By default, a new user belongs to the `public` role and has no privileges other than those assigned to the `public` role. For more information, see [Public role](#public-role).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### `root` user

The `root` user is created by default for each cluster. The `root` user is assigned to the [`admin` role](#admin-role) and has all privileges across the cluster.

## Roles

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
[`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.html) is an enterprise feature. To request a 30-day trial license, see [Get CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

A role is a group of users and/or other roles for which you can grant or revoke privileges as a whole. To simplify access management, create a role and grant privileges to the role, then create SQL users and grant them membership to the role.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
PostgreSQL uses the term "role" to mean either a database user or a group of database users. CockroachDB, however, uses the term "user" to mean an individual database user and "role" to mean a group of database users.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Create and manage roles

To create and manage your cluster's roles, use the following statements:

Statement | Description
----------|------------
[`CREATE ROLE` (enterprise)](create-role.html) | Create SQL roles.
[`DROP ROLE` (enterprise)](drop-role.html) | Remove one or more SQL roles.
[`GRANT <roles>`](grant-roles.html) | Add a role or user as a member to a role.
[`REVOKE <roles>`](revoke-roles.html) | Revoke a role or user's membership to a role.
[`GRANT <privileges>`](grant.html) | Manage each role or user's SQL privileges for interacting with specific databases and tables.
[`REVOKE <privileges>`](revoke.html) | Revoke privileges from users and/or roles.
[`SHOW ROLES`](show-roles.html) | List the roles for all databases.
[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.html) | List the privileges granted to users.

### Default roles

The `admin` and `public` roles exist by default for both core and enterprise clusters.

#### `admin` role

The `admin` role is created by default and cannot be dropped. Users belonging to the `admin` role have all privileges for all database objects across the cluster. The `root` user belongs to the `admin` role by default.

An `admin` user is a member of the `admin` role. Only `admin` users can use [`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.html) and [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.html).

To assign a user to the `admin` role:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> GRANT admin TO <username>;
~~~

#### `public` role

All new users and roles belong to the `public` role by default. You can grant and revoke the privileges on the `public` role.

### Terminology

#### Role admin

A `role admin` is a member of the role that's allowed to grant or revoke role membership to other users for that specific role. To create a `role admin`, use [`WITH ADMIN OPTION`](grant-roles.html#grant-the-admin-option).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The terms "`admin` role" and "`role admin`" can be confusing. A user who is a member of the `admin` role has all privileges on all database objects across the entire cluster, whereas a `role admin` has privileges limited to the role they are a member of. Assign the `admin` role to a SQL user if you want the user to have privileges across the cluster. Make a SQL user the `role admin` if you want to limit the user’s privileges to its current role, but with an option to grant or revoke role membership to other users.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Direct member

A user or role that is an immediate member of the role.

Example: A is a member of B.

#### Indirect member

A user or role that is a member of the role by association.

Example: A is a member of C ... is a member of B where "..." is an arbitrary number of memberships.

## Privileges

When a user connects to a database, either via the built-in SQL client or a client driver, CockroachDB checks the user and role's privileges for each statement executed. If the user does not have sufficient privileges for a statement, CockroachDB gives an error.

### Assign privileges

Use the [`GRANT <privileges>`](grant.html) and [`REVOKE <privileges>`](revoke.html) statements to manage privileges for users and roles.

Take the following points into consideration while granting privileges to roles and users:

- When a role or user is granted privileges for a database, new tables created in the database will inherit the privileges, but the privileges can then be changed. To grant privileges to a user on all existing tables in a database, see [Grant privileges on all tables in a database](grant.html#grant-privileges-on-all-tables-in-a-database)

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    The user does not get privileges to existing tables in the database.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- When a role or user is granted privileges for a table, the privileges are limited to the table.
- In CockroachDB, privileges are granted to users and roles at the database and table levels. They are not yet supported for other granularities such as columns or rows.
- The `root` user automatically belongs to the `admin` role and has the `ALL` privilege for new databases.
- For privileges required by specific statements, see the documentation for the respective [SQL statement](sql-statements.html).

You can manage the following privileges for databases and tables:

- `ALL`
- `CREATE`
- `DROP`
- `GRANT`
- `SELECT`
- `INSERT`
- `DELETE`
- `UPDATE`

## Authorization best practices

We recommend the following best practices to set up access control for your clusters:

- Use the `root` user only for database administration tasks such as creating and managing other [users](#sql-users), creating and managing [roles](#roles), and creating and managing databases. Do not use the `root` user for applications; instead, create users with specific [privileges](#assign-privileges) based on your application’s access requirements.
- Enterprise customers: Create roles with specific privileges, create users, and then add the users to the relevant roles.
- Use the ["least privilege model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) to grant privileges to users and roles.

The following example uses MovR, a fictional vehicle-sharing application, to demonstrate CockroachDB SQL statements. For more information about the MovR example application and dataset, see [MovR: A Global Vehicle-sharing App](movr.html).

Let's say we want to create the following access control setup for the `movr` database:

- One database admin (named `db_admin`) who can perform all database operations for existing tables as well as for tables added in the future.
- One app user (named `app_user`) who can add, read update, and delete vehicles from the `vehicles` table.
- One user (named `report_user`) who can only read the `vehicles` table.

1. Use the [`cockroach demo`](cockroach-demo.html) command to load the `movr` database and dataset into a CockroachDB cluster:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach demo
    ~~~

2. Create the database admin (named `db_admin`) who can perform all database operations for existing tables as well as for  tables added in the future:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER db_admin;
    ~~~

3. Grant all privileges on database `movr` to user `db_admin`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT ALL ON DATABASE movr TO db_admin;
    ~~~

4. Grant all privileges on all tables in database `movr` to user `db_admin`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT ALL ON TABLE * TO db_admin;
    ~~~

5. Verify that `db_admin` has all privileges:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR db_admin;
    ~~~

    ~~~
          database_name |    schema_name     |         table_name         | grantee  | privilege_type
    +---------------+--------------------+----------------------------+----------+----------------+
      movr          | crdb_internal      | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | information_schema | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | pg_catalog         | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | promo_codes                | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | rides                      | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | user_promo_codes           | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | users                      | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | vehicle_location_histories | db_admin | ALL
      movr          | public             | vehicles                   | db_admin | ALL
    (10 rows)
    ~~~

6. As the `root` user, create a SQL user named `app_user` with permissions to add, read, update, and delete vehicles in the `vehicles` table:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER app_user;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT ON vehicles TO app_user;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR app_user;
    ~~~

    ~~~
          database_name | schema_name | table_name | grantee  | privilege_type
    +---------------+-------------+------------+----------+----------------+
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | DELETE
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | INSERT
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | SELECT
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | UPDATE
    (4 rows)
    ~~~

7. As the `root` user, create a SQL user named `report_user` with permissions to only read from the `vehicles` table:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER report_user;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT SELECT ON vehicles TO report_user;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR report_user;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      database_name | schema_name | table_name |   grantee   | privilege_type
    +---------------+-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | report_user | SELECT
    (1 row)
    ~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The [`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.html) command used in this example is an enterprise-only feature. To request a 30-day trial license, see [Get CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/).

Note that [`GRANT <roles>`](grant-roles.html) does not require an enterprise license. All users can grant the [default roles](#default-roles).

3. Create two database admin users (named `db_admin_1` and `db_admin_2`) and grant them membership to the `db_admin_role` role:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER db_admin_1;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER db_admin_2;
