summary: The CockroachDB vectorized SQL query execution engine processes query plans using a column-oriented model to improve performance.

<span class="version-tag">New in v19.2:</span> CockroachDB supports [column-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS#Column-oriented_systems) ("vectorized") query execution.

Many SQL databases execute [query plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_plan) one row of table data at a time. Row-oriented execution models can offer good performance for [online transaction processing (OLTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing) queries, but suboptimal performance for [online analytical processing (OLAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) queries. The CockroachDB vectorized execution engine dramatically improves performance over [row-oriented execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS#Row-oriented_systems) by processing each component of a query plan on type-specific batches of column data.

## Configuring vectorized execution

By default, vectorized execution is enabled in CockroachDB for [all operations that are guaranteed to execute in memory](#disk-spilling-operations), on tables with [supported data types](#supported-data-types).

You can turn vectorized execution on or off for all operations with the `sql.defaults.vectorize` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) or the `vectorize` [session variable](set-vars.html). The following options are supported for both the cluster setting and session variable:

Option | Description
----------|------------
`auto` | Instructs CockroachDB to use the vectorized execution engine on operations that always execute in memory, without the need to spill intermediate results to disk.<br><br>**Default:** `vectorize=auto`
`experimental_on` | Turns on vectorized execution for all operations. We do not recommend using this setting in production environments, as it can lead to memory issues.<br/>See [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for more information.
`off` | Turns off vectorized execution for all operations.

For information about configuring cluster settings, see [Cluster Settings](cluster-settings.html).<br>For information about setting session variables, see [`SET` &lt;session variable&gt;](set-vars.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To see if CockroachDB will use the vectorized execution engine for a query, run a simple [`EXPLAIN`](explain.html) statement on the query. If the `vectorize` property is `true`, the query will be executed with the vectorized engine. If it is `false`, the row-oriented execution engine is used instead.

### Setting the row threshold for vectorized execution

The efficiency of vectorized execution increases with the number of rows processed. If you are querying a table with a small number of rows, it is more efficient to use row-oriented execution.

By default, vectorized execution is enabled for queries on tables of 1000 rows or more. If the number of rows in a table falls below 1000, CockroachDB uses the row-oriented execution engine instead.

For performance tuning, you can change the minimum number of rows required to use the vectorized engine to execute a query plan with the `vectorize_row_count_threshold` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html). This setting is ignored if `vectorize=experimental_on`.


## How vectorized execution works

When you issue a query, the gateway node (i.e., the node from which you issue the query) [parses the query and creates a physical plan](architecture/sql-layer.html#sql-parser-planner-executor) for execution on each node that receives the plan. If vectorized execution is enabled, the physical plan is sent to each node to be executed by the vectorized execution engine.

To see a detailed view of the vectorized execution plan for a query, run the [`EXPLAIN(VEC)`](explain.html#vec-option) statement on the query.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For information about vectorized execution in the context of the CockroachDB architecture, see [Query Execution](architecture/sql-layer.html#query-execution).

For detailed examples of vectorized query execution for hash and merge joins, see the blog posts [40x faster hash joiner with vectorized execution](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorized-hash-joiner/) and [Vectorizing the merge joiner in CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorizing-the-merge-joiner-in-cockroachdb/).

## Known Limitations

Vectorized execution is not as extensively tested as CockroachDB's existing row-oriented execution engine. In addition, some data types are not supported, and support for some operations is experimental.

### Supported data types

Vectorized execution is supported for the following [data types](data-types.html) and their aliases:

- [`BOOL`](bool.html)
- [`BYTES`](bytes.html)
- [`FLOAT`](float.html)
- [`INT`](int.html)
- [`STRING`](string.html)

In all [`vectorize` modes](#configuring-vectorized-execution), queries on tables that contain unsupported data types are executed with the row-oriented execution engine. Using [`EXPLAIN(VEC)`](explain.html#vec-option) on queries of tables that include unsupported data types will return an unhandled data type error.

### Queries with constant `NULL` arguments

The vectorized execution engine does not support queries that contain a constant `NULL` argument. This includes `NOT NULL` permutations in generic [selection query](selection-queries.html) comparisons and [`CASE`](scalar-expressions.html#simple-case-expressions) expressions, in addition to other projection operators on constant `NULL` values.

For example, the following statements return an `unable to vectorize execution plan` error:

- `SELECT x IS NOT NULL FROM t`
- `CASE ... WHEN x IS NOT NULL ... ELSE ... END`
- `SELECT x + NULL FROM t`

For more information, see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/41001).

### Disk-spilling operations

Support for vectorized execution is experimental for the following memory-intensive operations:

{% include {{page.version.version}}/sql/disk-spilling-ops.md %}

You can configure a node's budget for in-memory query processing at node startup with the [`--max-sql-memory` flag](start-a-node.html#general). If a SQL query exceeds the memory budget, the node spills intermediate execution results to disk. The [`--max-disk-temp-storage` flag](start-a-node.html#general) sets the maximum on-disk storage capacity.
