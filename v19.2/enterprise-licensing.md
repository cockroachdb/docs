summary: Request and set trial and enterprise license keys for CockroachDB
toc: true
---

CockroachDB distributes a single binary that contains both core and [enterprise features](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/). You can use core features without any license key. However, to use the enterprise features, you need either a trial or an enterprise license key.

This page lists enterprise features, and shows you how to obtain and set trial and enterprise license keys for CockroachDB.

## Enterprise features

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/enterprise-features.md %}

## Types of licenses

Type | Description
-------------|------------
**Trial License** | A trial license enables you to try out CockroachDB enterprise features for 30 days for free.
**Enterprise License** | A paid enterprise license enables you to use CockroachDB enterprise features for longer periods (one year or more).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
<span class="version-tag">New in v19.2:</span> For quick local testing of Enterprise features, you can use the [`cockroach demo`](cockroach-demo.html) command, which starts a temporary, in-memory cluster with a SQL shell open and a trial license applied automatically.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Obtain a license

To obtain a trial license, fill out [the registration form](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/) and receive your trial license via email within a few minutes.

To upgrade to an enterprise license, <a href="mailto:sales@cockroachlabs.com">contact Sales</a>.

## Set a license

As the CockroachDB `root` user, open the [built-in SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html) in insecure or secure mode, as per your CockroachDB setup. In the following example, we assume that CockroachDB is running in insecure mode. Then use the `SET CLUSTER SETTING` command to set the name of your organization and the license key:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  SET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.organization = 'Acme Company';
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  SET CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';
~~~

## Verify a license

To verify a license, open the [built-in SQL shell](cockroach-sql.html) and use the `SHOW CLUSTER SETTING` command to check the organization name and license key:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  SHOW CLUSTER SETTING cluster.organization;
~~~
~~~
  cluster.organization
+----------------------+
  Acme Company
(1 row)
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  SHOW CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license;
~~~
~~~
             enterprise.license
+-------------------------------------------+
  crl-0-ChB1x...
(1 row)
~~~

The license setting is also logged in the cockroach.log on the node where the command is run:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
$ cat cockroach.log | grep license
~~~
~~~
I171116 18:11:48.279604 1514 sql/event_log.go:102  [client=[::1]:56357,user=root,n1] Event: "set_cluster_setting", target: 0, info: {SettingName:enterprise.license Value:xxxxxxxxxxxx User:root}
~~~

## Renew an expired license

After your license expires, the enterprise features stop working, but your production setup is unaffected. For example, the backup and restore features would not work until the license is renewed, but you would be able to continue using all other features of CockroachDB without interruption.

To renew an expired license, <a href="mailto:sales@cockroachlabs.com">contact Sales</a> and then [set](enterprise-licensing.html#set-a-license) the new license.
