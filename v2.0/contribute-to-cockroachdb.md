We made CockroachDB open source to empower developers to fix and
extend the product to better meet their needs. Nothing thrills us more
than people so passionate about the product that they‘re willing to
spend their own time to learn the codebase and give back to the
community. We created this doc so we can support contributors in a way
that doesn’t sacrifice precious bandwidth that we use to serve our
users and otherwise meet our business goals.

Our contributor guide is available in a public-facing wiki at
[wiki.crdb.io](https://wiki.crdb.io/wiki/spaces/CRDB/pages/73204033/Contributing+to+CockroachDB).
