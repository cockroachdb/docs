The choice of language matters. Speed, stability, maintainability: each of these attributes of the underlying language can impact how quickly CockroachDB evolves and how well it works. Not all languages were created equal. Go is an open source programming language developed primarily at Google as a viable alternative to C++ and Java.

-   Excellent environment for building distributed systems
-   Compiles for native performance
-   Garbage collection and type safety provide stability
-   Readable, well-documented code encourages open source contributions
