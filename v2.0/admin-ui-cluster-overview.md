On [accessing the Admin UI](admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html), the **Overview** page is displayed by default. The **Overview** page has three components: the [Cluster Overview panel](#cluster-overview-panel), the [Node List](#node-list), and the [Node Map](#node-map).

## Cluster Overview Panel
<img src="{{ 'images/admin_ui_summary_panel.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI Summary Panel" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:40%" />

The **Cluster Overview** panel provides the following metrics:

Metric | Description
--------|----
Capacity Usage | <ul><li>The storage capacity used as a percentage of total storage capacity allocated across all nodes.</li><li>The current capacity usage.</li></ul>
Node Status | <ul><li>The number of [live nodes](admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html#live-nodes) in the cluster.</li><li>The number of suspect nodes in the cluster. A node is considered a suspect node if it's liveness status is unavailable or the node is in the process of decommissioning.</li><li>The number of [dead nodes](admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html#dead-nodes) in the cluster.</li>
Replication Status | <ul><li>The total number of ranges in the cluster.</li><li>The number of [under-replicated ranges](admin-ui-replication-dashboard.html#review-of-cockroachdb-terminology) in the cluster. A non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.</li><li>The number of [unavailable ranges](admin-ui-replication-dashboard.html#review-of-cockroachdb-terminology) in the cluster. A non-zero number indicates an unstable cluster.</li>

## Node List

The **Node List** is displayed by default on the **Cluster Overview** page.

#### Live Nodes
Live nodes are nodes that are online and responding. They are marked with a green dot. If a node is removed or dies, the dot turns yellow to indicate that it is not responding. If the node remains unresponsive for a certain amount of time (5 minutes by default), the node turns red and is moved to the [**Dead Nodes**](#dead-nodes) section, indicating that it is no longer expected to come back.

The following details are shown for each live node:

Column | Description
-------|------------
ID | The ID of the node.
Address | The address of the node. You can click on the address to view further details about the node.
Uptime | How long the node has been running.
Bytes | The used capacity for the node.
Replicas | The number of replicas on the node.
Mem Usage | The memory usage for the node.
Version | The build tag of the CockroachDB version installed on the node.
Logs | Click **Logs** to see the logs for the node.

#### Dead Nodes

Nodes are considered dead once they have not responded for a certain amount of time ([5 minutes by default](stop-a-node.html#considerations)). At this point, the automated repair process starts, wherein CockroachDB automatically rebalances replicas from the dead node, using the unaffected replicas as sources. See [Stop a Node](stop-a-node.html#how-it-works) for more information.

The following details are shown for each dead node:

Column | Description
-------|------------
ID | The ID of the node.
Address | The address of the node. You can click on the address to view further details about the node.
Down Since | How long the node has been down.

#### Decommissioned Nodes

<span class="version-tag">New in v1.1:</span> Nodes that have been decommissioned for permanent removal from the cluster are listed in the **Decommissioned Nodes** table. They are marked with a yellow dot.

When you decommission a node, CockroachDB lets the node finish in-flight requests, rejects any new requests, and transfers all range replicas and range leases off the node so that it can be safely shut down. See [Remove Nodes](remove-nodes.html) for more information.

## Node Map

The **Node Map** is an [enterprise-only](enterprise-licensing.html) feature that gives you a visual representation of the geographical configuration of your cluster. To configure and understand the Node Map, see [Node Map](admin-ui-node-map.html).
