summary: Identify your intent to retry aborted transactions with the SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart statement in CockroachDB.

The `SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart` statement defines the intent to retry [transactions](transactions.html) using the CockroachDB-provided function for client-side transaction retries. For more information, see [Transaction Retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}CockroachDBâ€™s <code>SAVEPOINT</code> implementation only supports the <code>cockroach_restart</code> savepoint and does not support all savepoint functionality, such as nested transactions.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Synopsis

{% include sql/{{ page.version.version }}/diagrams/savepoint.html %}

## Required Privileges

No [privileges](privileges.html) are required to create a savepoint. However, privileges are required for each statement within a transaction.

## Example

### Create Savepoint

After you `BEGIN` the transaction, you must create the savepoint to identify that if the transaction contends with another transaction for resources and "loses", you intend to use [the function for client-side transaction retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries).

~~~ sql
> BEGIN;

> SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;

> UPDATE products SET inventory = 0 WHERE sku = '8675309';

> INSERT INTO orders (customer, sku, status) VALUES (1001, '8675309', 'new');

> RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart;

> COMMIT;
~~~

When using `SAVEPOINT`, your application must also include functions to execute retries with [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](rollback-transaction.html#retry-a-transaction).
