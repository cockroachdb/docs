## General Deployment Steps

If we don't have a guide for your platform, you can deploy CockroachDB to any cloud environment using the following steps:

1. Create firewall rules to allow TCP communication on the following ports:
  - **26257** (`tcp:26257`) for nodes to join clusters and connect with applications

2. Manually deploy CockroachDB using one of the following steps:
