Orchestration systems automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Combined with CockroachDB's [automated sharding](frequently-asked-questions.html#how-does-cockroachdb-scale) and [fault tolerance](frequently-asked-questions.html#how-does-cockroachdb-survive-failures), they have the potential to lower operator overhead to almost nothing. 

Use the following guides to run CockroachDB with popular open-source orchestration systems:

- [Kubernetes](orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html)
- [Docker Swarm](orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-docker-swarm.html)
