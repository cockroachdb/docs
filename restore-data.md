CockroachDB offers two methods to importback up your cluster's data:

- [Import data](import-data.html) from multiple file types (including CockroachDB-generated `.sql` dumps).
- [`RESTORE`](restore.html) (*[enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/) only*), which is a SQL statement to restore your cluster using backups from cloud or network file storage.
