## Overview

Encryption at rest allows encryption of all files on disk using AES in counter mode, with all key
sizes allowed.

Encryption is performed in the [storage layer](architecture/storage-layer.html) and configured per store.
All files used by the store, regardless of contents, are encrypted with the desired algorithm.

To allow arbitrary rotation schedules and ensure security of the keys, we use two layers of keys:

| Level | Description |
|-|-|
| Store keys | Provided by the user in a file. They are used to encrypt the list of data keys (see below).<br><br>This is known as a **key encryption key**: it's only purpose is to encrypt other keys.<br><br>Store keys are never persisted by CockroachDB.<br><br>Since very little data is encrypted using this key, it can have a very long lifetime without risk of reuse. |
| Data keys | Automatically generated by CockroachDB. They are used to encrypt all files on disk.<br><br> This is known as a **data encryption key**.<br><br>Data keys are persisted in a key registry file, encrypted using the store key.<br><br>The key has a short lifetime to avoid reuse. |

Store keys are specified by passing a path to a locally readable file. The file must contain 32 bytes (the key ID)
followed by the key (16, 24, or 32 bytes). The size of the key dictates the version of AES to use (AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256).

At startup, CockroachDB uses a data key with the same length as the store key. If encryption has just been enabled,
the key size has changed, or the data key is too old (default lifetime is one week), CockroachDB generates a new data key.

Any new file created by the store uses the currently-active data key. All data keys (both active and previous) are stored in a key registry file and encrypted with the active store key.

After startup, if the active data key is too old CockroachDB generates a new data key and marks it as active using it for all further encryption.

CockroachDB does not currently force re-encryption of older files but instead relies on normal RocksDB churn to slowly rewrite all data with the desired encryption.

## Rotating keys

Key rotation is necessary for encryption at rest for multiple reasons:

* prevent key reuse with the same encryption parameters (after many files)
* reduce the risk of key exposure

Store keys are specified by the user and must be rotated by specifying different keys.
This is done by setting the `key` parameter of the `--enterprise-encryption` flag to the path to the new key,
and `old-key` to the previously-used key.

Data keys will automatically be rotated at startup if any of the following conditions are met:

* the active store key changed
* the encryption type changed (different key size, or plaintext to/from encryption)
* the current data key is `rotation-period` old or more.

Data keys will automatically be rotated at runtime if the current data key is `rotation-period` old or more.

Once rotated, an old store key cannot be made the active key again.

Upon store key rotation the data keys registry is decrypted using the old key and encrypted with the new
key. The newly-generated data key is used to encrypt all new data from this point on.

## Changing encryption type

The user can change from plaintext to encryption, between encryption algorithms (various key sizes),
or from encryption to plaintext.

When changing the encryption type to plaintext, the data key registry is no longer encrypted and all previous
data keys are readable by anyone. All data on the store is effectively readable.

When changing from plaintext to encryption, it will take some time for all data to eventually be re-written
and encrypted.

## Recommendations

There are a number of considerations to keep in mind when running with encryption.

### Deployment configuration

To prevent key leakage, production deployments should:

* use encrypted swap, or disable swap entirely
* disable core files

CockroachDB attempts to disable core files at startup when encryption is requested, but it may fail.

### Key handling

Key management is the most dangerous aspect of encryption. The following rules should be kept in mind:

* make sure only the unix user running the `cockroach` process has access to the keys
* do not store the keys on the same partition/drive as the cockroach data. It is best to load keys at run time from a separate system (eg: keywhiz, vault)
* rotate store keys frequently (every few weeks to months)
* keep the data key rotation period low (default is one week)

### Other recommendations

A few other recommendations apply for best security practices:

* do not switch from encrypted to plaintext, this leaks data keys. When plaintext is selected, all previously encrypted data must be considered reachable
* do not copy the encrypted files as the data keys are not easily available
* if encryption is desired, start a node with it enabled from first run without ever running in plaintext

Note that backups taken with the [`BACKUP`](backup.html) statement are not encrypted (whether you are using this feature or not). If you want encrypted backups, you will need to encrypt your backup files using your preferred encryption method.

## Example

### Generating key files

Cockroach determines which encryption algorithm to use based on the size of the key file.
The key file must contain random data making up the key ID (32 bytes) and the actual key (16, 24, or 32
bytes depending on the encryption algorithm).

| Algorithm | Key size | Key file size |
|-|-|-|
| AES-128 | 128 bits (16 bytes) | 48 bytes |
| AES-192 | 192 bits (24 bytes) | 56 bytes |
| AES-256 | 256 bits (32 bytes) | 64 bytes |

Generating a key file can be done using the `cockroach` CLI:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach gen encryption-key -s 128 /path/to/my/aes-128.key
~~~

Or the equivalent [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/openssl.html) CLI command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ openssl rand -out /path/to/my/aes-128.key 48
~~~

### Starting a node with encryption

Encryption is configured at node start time using the `--enterprise-encryption` command line flag.
The flag specifies the encryption options for one of the stores on the node. If multiple stores exist,
the flag must be specified for each store.

The flag takes the form: `--enterprise-encryption=path=<store path>,key=<key file>,old-key=<old key file>,rotation-period=<period>`.

The allowed components in the flag are:

| Component | Requirement | Description |
|-|-|-|
| path            | required | Path of the store to apply encryption to |
| key             | required | Path to the key file to encrypt data with, or `plain` for plaintext |
| old-key         | required | Path to key file the data is encrypted with, or `plain` for plaintext |
| rotation-period | optional | How often data keys should be automatically rotated |

The `key` and `old-key` components must **always** be specified. They allow for transitions between
encryption algorithms, and between plaintext and encrypted.

Starting a node for the first time using AES-128 encryption can be done using:
{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --store=cockroach-data --enterprise-encryption=path=cockroach-data,key=/path/to/my/aes-128.key,old-key=plain
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Once specified for a given store, the `--enterprise-encryption` flag must always be present.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Checking encryption status

Encryption status can be see on the node's stores report, reachable through: `http(s)://nodeaddress:8080/#/reports/stores/local`.

The report shows the currently-active store key as well as the currently-active data key. The `encryption_type` field
reflects the algorithm currently in use.

Information about keys is written to the logs, including:

* active/old key information at startup
* new key information after data key rotation

The information includes the key ID, algorithm, source (filename) for store keys, and parent key ID for data keys.

The actual key is never displayed or logged.

### Changing encryption algorithm or keys

Encryption type and keys can be changed at any time by restarting the node.
To change keys or encryption type, the `key` component of the `--enterprise-encryption` flag is set to the new key,
while the key previously used must be specified in the `old-key` component.

For example, we can switch from AES-128 to AES-256 using:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --store=cockroach-data --enterprise-encryption=path=cockroach-data,key=/path/to/my/aes-256.key,old-key=/path/to/my/aes-128.key
~~~

Upon starting, the node will read the existing data keys using the old encryption key (`aes-128.key`), then rewrite
the data keys using the new key (`aes-256.key`). A new data key will be generated to match the desired `AES-256` algorithm.

The new key can be seen as active in the Admin UI under the stores report page.

To disable encryption, specify `key=plain`. The data keys will be stored in plaintext and new data will not be encrypted.

To rotate keys, specify `key=/path/to/my/new-aes-128.key` and `old-key=/path/to/my/old-aes-128.key`. The data keys
will be decrypted using the old key then encrypted using the new key. A new data key will also be generated.
