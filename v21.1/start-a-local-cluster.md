Once you've [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html), it's simple to run an insecure multi-node cluster locally.

{% include cockroachcloud/use-cockroachcloud-instead.md %}

## Before you begin

- Make sure you have already [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).
- For quick SQL testing or app development, consider [running a single-node cluster](cockroach-start-single-node.html) instead.
- Note that running multiple nodes on a single host is useful for testing CockroachDB, but it's not suitable for production. To run a physically distributed cluster, see [Manual Deployment](manual-deployment.html) or [Orchestrated Deployment](orchestration.html), and review the [Production Checklist](recommended-production-settings.html).

<!-- TODO: Update the asciicast
Also, feel free to watch this process in action before going through the steps yourself. Note that you can copy commands directly from the video, and you can use **<** and **>** to go back and forward.

-->

## Step 1. Start the cluster

1. Use the [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) command to start the first node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=node1 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26257 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8080 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    You'll see a message like the following:

    ~~~
    *
    * WARNING: RUNNING IN INSECURE MODE!
    *
    * - Your cluster is open for any client that can access localhost.
    * - Any user, even root, can log in without providing a password.
    * - Any user, connecting as root, can read or write any data in your cluster.
    * - There is no network encryption nor authentication, and thus no confidentiality.
    *
    * Check out how to secure your cluster: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/secure-a-cluster.html
    *
    *
    * INFO: initial startup completed.
    * Node will now attempt to join a running cluster, or wait for `cockroach init`.
    * Client connections will be accepted after this completes successfully.
    * Check the log file(s) for progress.
    *
    ~~~

2. Take a moment to understand the [flags](cockroach-start.html#flags) you used:
    - The `--insecure` flag makes communication unencrypted.
    - Since this is a purely local cluster, `--listen-addr=localhost:26257` and `--http-addr=localhost:8080` tell the node to listen only on `localhost`, with port `26257` used for internal and client traffic and port `8080` used for HTTP requests from the DB Console.
    - The `--store` flag indicates the location where the node's data and logs are stored.
    - The `--join` flag specifies the addresses and ports of the nodes that will initially comprise your cluster. You'll use this exact `--join` flag when starting other nodes as well.

        {% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/join-flag-single-region.md %}
    - The `--background` flag starts the `cockroach` process in the background so you can continue using the same terminal for other operations.

3. Start two more nodes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=node2 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26258 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8081 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=node3 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26259 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8082 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    These commands are the same as before but with unique `--store`, `--listen-addr`, and `--http-addr` flags.

4. Use the [`cockroach init`](cockroach-init.html) command to perform a one-time initialization of the cluster, sending the request to any node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach init --insecure --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

    You'll see the following message:

    ~~~
    Cluster successfully initialized
    ~~~

    At this point, each node also prints helpful [startup details](cockroach-start.html#standard-output) to its log. For example, the following command retrieves node 1's startup details:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ grep 'node starting' node1/logs/cockroach.log -A 11
    ~~~

    The output will look something like this:

    ~~~
    CockroachDB node starting at {{page.release_info.start_time}}
    build:               CCL {{page.release_info.version}} @ {{page.release_info.build_time}} (go1.12.6)
    webui:               http://localhost:8080
    sql:                 postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable
    RPC client flags:    cockroach <client cmd> --host=localhost:26257 --insecure
    logs:                /Users/<username>/node1/logs
    temp dir:            /Users/<username>/node1/cockroach-temp242232154
    external I/O path:   /Users/<username>/node1/extern
    store[0]:            path=/Users/<username>/node1
    status:              initialized new cluster
    clusterID:           8a681a16-9623-4fc1-a537-77e9255daafd
    nodeID:              1
    ~~~

## Step 2. Use the built-in SQL client

Now that your cluster is live, you can use any node as a SQL gateway. To test this out, let's use CockroachDB's built-in SQL client.

1. Run the [cockroach sql](cockroach-sql.html) command against node 1:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

2. Run some basic [CockroachDB SQL statements](learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE bank;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE bank.accounts (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance DECIMAL);
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO bank.accounts VALUES (1, 1000.50);
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      id | balance
    +----+---------+
       1 | 1000.50
    (1 row)
    ~~~

3. Now exit the SQL shell on node 1 and open a new shell on node 2:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > \q
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure --host=localhost:26258
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    In a real deployment, all nodes would likely use the default port `26257`, and so you wouldn't need to set the port portion of `--host`.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

4. Run the same `SELECT` query as before:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      id | balance
    +----+---------+
       1 | 1000.50
    (1 row)
    ~~~

    As you can see, node 1 and node 2 behaved identically as SQL gateways.

5. Exit the SQL shell on node 2:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > \q
    ~~~

## Step 3. Run a sample workload

CockroachDB also comes with a number of [built-in workloads](cockroach-workload.html) for simulating client traffic. Let's the workload based on CockroachDB's sample vehicle-sharing application, [MovR](movr.html).

1. Load the initial dataset:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach workload init movr \
    'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'
    ~~~

    ~~~
    I190926 16:50:35.663708 1 workload/workloadsql/dataload.go:135  imported users (0s, 50 rows)
    I190926 16:50:35.682583 1 workload/workloadsql/dataload.go:135  imported vehicles (0s, 15 rows)
    I190926 16:50:35.769572 1 workload/workloadsql/dataload.go:135  imported rides (0s, 500 rows)
    I190926 16:50:35.836619 1 workload/workloadsql/dataload.go:135  imported vehicle_location_histories (0s, 1000 rows)
    I190926 16:50:35.915498 1 workload/workloadsql/dataload.go:135  imported promo_codes (0s, 1000 rows)
    ~~~

2. Run the workload for 5 minutes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach workload run movr \
    --duration=5m \
    'postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable'
    ~~~

## Step 4. Access the DB Console

The CockroachDB [DB Console](ui-overview.html) gives you insight into the overall health of your cluster as well as the performance of the client workload.

1. Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080" data-proofer-ignore>http://localhost:8080</a>.

2. On the [**Cluster Overview**](ui-cluster-overview-page.html), notice that three nodes are live, with an identical replica count on each node:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.1/ui_cluster_overview_3_nodes.png' | relative_url }}" alt="DB Console" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    This demonstrates CockroachDB's [automated replication](demo-data-replication.html) of data via the Raft consensus protocol.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Capacity metrics can be incorrect when running multiple nodes on a single machine. For more details, see this [limitation](known-limitations.html#available-capacity-metric-in-the-db-console).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

3. Click [**Metrics**](ui-overview-dashboard.html) to access a variety of time series dashboards, including graphs of SQL queries and service latency over time:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.1/ui_overview_dashboard_3_nodes.png' | relative_url }}" alt="DB Console" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

4. Use the [**Databases**](ui-databases-page.html), [**Statements**](ui-statements-page.html), and [**Jobs**](ui-jobs-page.html) pages to view details about your databases and tables, to assess the performance of specific queries, and to monitor the status of long-running operations like schema changes, respectively.

## Step 5. Simulate node failure

1. In a new terminal, run the [`cockroach quit`](cockroach-quit.html) command against a node to simulate a node failure:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26259
    ~~~

2. Back in the DB Console, despite one node being "suspect", notice the continued SQL traffic:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.1/ui_overview_dashboard_1_suspect.png' | relative_url }}" alt="DB Console" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    This demonstrates CockroachDB's use of the Raft consensus protocol to [maintain availability and consistency in the face of failure](demo-fault-tolerance-and-recovery.html); as long as a majority of replicas remain online, the cluster and client traffic continue uninterrupted.

4. Restart node 3:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=node3 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26259 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8082 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

## Step 6. Scale the cluster

Adding capacity is as simple as starting more nodes with `cockroach start`.

1. Start 2 more nodes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=node4 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26260 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8083 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --store=node5 \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26261 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8084 \
    --join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259 \
    --background
    ~~~

    Again, these commands are the same as before but with unique `--store`, `--listen-addr`, and `--http-addr` flags.

2. Back on the **Cluster Overview** in the DB Console, you'll now see 5 nodes listed:

    <img src="{{ 'images/v21.1/ui_cluster_overview_5_nodes.png' | relative_url }}" alt="DB Console" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

    At first, the replica count will be lower for nodes 4 and 5. Very soon, however, you'll see those numbers even out across all nodes, indicating that data is being [automatically rebalanced](demo-replication-and-rebalancing.html) to utilize the additional capacity of the new nodes.

## Step 7. Stop the cluster

1. When you're done with your test cluster, use the [`cockroach quit`](cockroach-quit.html) command to gracefully shut down each node.

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26257
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26258
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26259
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    For the last 2 nodes, the shutdown process will take longer (about a minute each) and will eventually force the nodes to stop. This is because, with only 2 of 5 nodes left, a majority of replicas are not available, and so the cluster is no longer operational.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26260
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure --host=localhost:26261
    ~~~

2. To restart the cluster at a later time, run the same `cockroach start` commands as earlier from the directory containing the nodes' data stores.  

    If you do not plan to restart the cluster, you may want to remove the nodes' data stores:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ rm -rf node1 node2 node3 node4 node5
    ~~~
