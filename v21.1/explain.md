title: EXPLAIN
summary: The EXPLAIN statement provides information you can use to optimize SQL queries.
toc: true
---

The `EXPLAIN` [statement](sql-statements.html) returns CockroachDB's statement plan for an [explainable statement](sql-grammar.html#preparable_stmt). You can then use this information to optimize the query.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To actually execute a statement and return a physical statement plan with execution statistics, use [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain-analyze.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Query optimization

Using `EXPLAIN`'s output, you can optimize your queries by taking the following points into consideration:

- Queries with fewer levels execute more quickly. Restructuring queries to require fewer levels of processing will generally improve performance.

- Avoid scanning an entire table, which is the slowest way to access data. You can avoid this by [creating indexes](indexes.html) that contain at least one of the columns that the query is filtering in its `WHERE` clause.

     You can disable statement plans that perform full table scans with the `disallow_full_table_scans` [session variable](set-vars.html). When `disallow_full_table_scans=on`, attempting to execute a query with a plan that includes a full table scan will return an error.

     The statement planner uses the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html) to create statement plans. Even after adding secondary indexes, the optimizer may decide that a full table scan will be faster.

     For example, if you add a secondary index to a table with a large number of rows and see that a statement plan isn't using the secondary index, it is likely that performing a full table scan using the primary key is faster than doing a secondary index scan plus an [index join](indexes.html).

- By default, the [vectorized execution](vectorized-execution.html) engine is enabled for all [supported operations](vectorized-execution.html#disk-spilling-operations). If you are querying a table with a small number of rows, it might be more efficient to use row-oriented execution. The `vectorize_row_count_threshold` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) specifies the minimum number of rows required to use the vectorized engine to execute a statement plan.

You can find out if your queries are performing entire table scans by using `EXPLAIN` to see which:

- Indexes the query uses; shown as the value of `table` property.

- Key values in the index are being scanned; shown as the value of the `spans` property.

 You can also see the estimated number of rows that a scan will perform in the `estimated row count` property.

For more information about indexing and table scans, see [Find the Indexes and Key Ranges a Query Uses](#find-the-indexes-and-key-ranges-a-query-uses).

## Synopsis

<section>{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/generated/diagrams/explain.html %}</section>

## Required privileges

The user requires the appropriate [privileges](authorization.html#assign-privileges) for the statement being explained.

## Parameters

 Parameter          | Description
--------------------+------------
 `VERBOSE`          | Show as much information as possible about the statement plan.
 `TYPES`            | Include the intermediate [data types](data-types.html) CockroachDB chooses to evaluate intermediate SQL expressions.
 `OPT`              | Display the statement plan tree generated by the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html).<br/><br/>To include cost details used by the optimizer in planning the query, use `OPT, VERBOSE`. To include cost and type details, use `OPT, TYPES`. To include all details used by the optimizer, including statistics, use `OPT, ENV`.
 `VEC`              | Show detailed information about the [vectorized execution](vectorized-execution.html) plan for a query.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
`EXPLAIN` also includes other modes besides statement plans that are useful only to CockroachDB developers, which are not documented here.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Success responses

Successful `EXPLAIN` statements return tables with the following details in the `info` column:

 Detail | Description
-----------|-------------
Global properties | Properties that apply to the entire query plan. Global properties include `distribution` and `vectorized`.
Statement plan tree | A tree representation of the hierarchy of the statement plan.
Node details | The properties, columns, and ordering details for the current statement plan node in the tree.
Number of rows | The number of rows affected by the query.
Time | The time details for the query. The total time is the planning and execution time of the query. The execution time is the time it took for the final statement plan to complete. The network time is the amount of time it took to distribute the query across the relevant nodes in the cluster. Some queries do not need to be distributed, so the network time is 0ms.

## Examples

The following examples use the [`movr` example dataset](cockroach-demo.html#datasets).

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/demo_movr.md %}

### Default statement plans

By default, `EXPLAIN` includes the least detail about the statement plan but can be useful to find out which indexes and index key ranges are used by a query. For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 90 ORDER BY revenue ASC;
~~~

~~~
                                             info
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: full
  vectorized: true

  • sort
  │ estimated row count: 12,317
  │ order: +revenue
  │
  └── • filter
      │ estimated row count: 12,317
      │ filter: revenue > 90
      │
      └── • scan
            estimated row count: 125,000 (100% of the table; stats collected 19 minutes ago)
            table: rides@primary
            spans: FULL SCAN
(15 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

The output shows the tree structure of the statement plan, in this case a `sort`, a `filter`, and then a `scan`.

The output also describes a set of properties, some global to the query, and some specific to an operation listed in the true structure (in this case, `sort`, `filter`, or `scan`):

- `distribution`:`full`
  <br>The planner chose a distributed execution plan, where execution of the query is performed by multiple nodes in parallel, then the final results are returned by the gateway node. An execution plan with `full` distribution doesn't process on all nodes in the cluster. It is executed simultaneously on multiple nodes.
  <br>An execution plan with `local` distribution, on the other hand, is performed only on the gateway node. Even if the execution plan is `local`, row data may be fetched from remote nodes, but the processing of the data is performed by the local node.
- `vectorized`:`true`
  <br>The plan will be executed with the [vectorized execution engine](vectorized-execution.html).
- `order`:`+revenue`
  <br>The sort will be ordered ascending on the `revenue` column.
- `filter`: `revenue > 90`
  <br>The scan filters on the `revenue` column.
-  `estimated row count`:`125,000 (100% of the table; stats collected 19 minutes ago)`
  <br>The estimated number of rows scanned by the query, in this case, `125,000` rows of data; the percentage of the table the query spans, in this case 100%; and when the statistics for the table were last collected, in this case 19 minutes ago.
- `table`:`rides@primary`
  <br>The table is scanned on the `primary` index.
- `spans`:`FULL SCAN`
  <br>The table is scanned on all key ranges of the `primary` index (i.e., a full table scan). For more information on indexes and key ranges, see the [example](#find-the-indexes-and-key-ranges-a-query-uses) below.

If you run `EXPLAIN` on a [join](joins.html) query, the output will display which type of join will be executed. For example, the following `EXPLAIN` output shows that the query will perform a [hash join](joins.html#hash-joins):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM rides AS r
JOIN users AS u ON r.rider_id = u.id;
~~~

~~~
                                           info
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: full
  vectorized: true

  • hash join
  │ estimated row count: 124,482
  │ equality: (rider_id) = (id)
  │
  ├── • scan
  │     estimated row count: 125,000 (100% of the table; stats collected 24 minutes ago)
  │     table: rides@primary
  │     spans: FULL SCAN
  │
  └── • scan
        estimated row count: 12,500 (100% of the table; stats collected 35 minutes ago)
        table: users@primary
        spans: FULL SCAN
(16 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms
~~~

And the following output shows that the query will perform a cross join:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM rides AS r
JOIN users AS u ON r.city = 'new york';
~~~

~~~
                                          info
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: full
  vectorized: true

  • cross join
  │ estimated row count: 176,093,135
  │
  ├── • scan
  │     estimated row count: 14,087 (11% of the table; stats collected 25 minutes ago)
  │     table: rides@primary
  │     spans: [/'new york' - /'new york']
  │
  └── • scan
        estimated row count: 12,500 (100% of the table; stats collected 36 minutes ago)
        table: users@primary
        spans: FULL SCAN
(15 rows)

Time: 3ms total (execution 1ms / network 2ms)
~~~

`EXPLAIN` output for [`INSERT`](insert.html) queries is similar to the output for standard `SELECT` queries. For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN INSERT INTO users(id, city, name) VALUES ('c28f5c28-f5c2-4000-8000-000000000026', 'new york', 'Petee');
~~~

~~~
                         info
-------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: local
  vectorized: true

  • insert
  │ into: users(id, city, name, address, credit_card)
  │ auto commit
  │
  └── • values
        size: 4 columns, 1 row
(9 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

The output for this `INSERT` lists the primary operation (in this case, `insert`), and the table and columns affected by the operation in the `into` field (in this case, the `id`, `city`, `name`, `address`, and `credit_card` columns of the `users` table). The output also includes the size of the `INSERT` in the `size` field (in this case, 4 columns in a single row).

`EXPLAIN` output can include more information, for more complex types of `INSERT` queries. For example, suppose that you create a `UNIQUE` index on the `users` table:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON users(city, id, name);
~~~

And then you want the `EXPLAIN` output for an [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` statement](insert.html#on-conflict-clause) that inserts some data that might conflict with the `UNIQUE` constraint imposed on the `name`, `city`, and `id` columns:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN INSERT INTO users(id, city, name) VALUES ('c28f5c28-f5c2-4000-8000-000000000026', 'new york', 'Petee') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
~~~

~~~
                                                               info
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: local
  vectorized: true

  • insert
  │ into: users(id, city, name, address, credit_card)
  │ auto commit
  │ arbiter indexes: primary, users_city_id_name_key
  │
  └── • lookup join (anti)
      │ estimated row count: 0
      │ table: users@users_city_id_name_key
      │ equality: (column2, column1, column3) = (city,id,name)
      │ equality cols are key
      │
      └── • cross join (anti)
          │ estimated row count: 0
          │
          ├── • values
          │     size: 4 columns, 1 row
          │
          └── • scan
                estimated row count: 1 (<0.01% of the table; stats collected 38 minutes ago)
                table: users@users_city_id_name_key
                spans: [/'new york'/'c28f5c28-f5c2-4000-8000-000000000026' - /'new york'/'c28f5c28-f5c2-4000-8000-000000000026']
(24 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

Because the `INSERT` includes an `ON CONFLICT` clause, the query requires more than a simple `insert` operation. CockroachDB must check the provided values against the values in the database, to ensure that the `UNIQUE` constraint on `name`, `city`, and `id` is not violated. Note that the output also lists the indexes available to detect conflicts (the `arbiter indexes`), including the `users_city_id_name_key` index.

### `VERBOSE` option

The `VERBOSE` option:

- Includes SQL expressions that are involved in each processing stage, providing more granular detail about which portion of your query is represented at each level.
- Includes detail about which columns are being used by each level, as well as properties of the result set on that level.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (VERBOSE) SELECT * FROM rides AS r
JOIN users AS u ON r.rider_id = u.id
WHERE r.city = 'new york'
ORDER BY r.revenue ASC;
~~~

~~~

      │     estimated row count: 14,087 (11% of the table; stats collected 29 minutes ago)
      │     table: rides@primary
      │     spans: /"new york"-/"new york"/PrefixEnd
      │
      └── • scan
            columns: (id, city, name, address, credit_card)
            estimated row count: 12,500 (100% of the table; stats collected 42 seconds ago)
            table: users@primary
            spans: FULL SCAN
(25 rows)

Time: 2ms total (execution 2ms / network 0ms)
~~~

### `TYPES` option

The `TYPES` mode includes the types of the values used in the statement plan. It also includes the SQL expressions that were involved in each processing stage, and includes the columns used by each level.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (TYPES) SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 90 ORDER BY revenue ASC;
~~~

~~~
                   info
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: full
  vectorized: true

  • sort
  │ columns: (id uuid, city varchar, vehicle_city varchar, rider_id uuid, vehicle_id uuid, start_address varchar, end_address varchar, start_time timestamp, end_time timestamp, revenue decimal)
  │ ordering: +revenue
  │ estimated row count: 12,317
  │ order: +revenue
  │
  └── • filter
      │ columns: (id uuid, city varchar, vehicle_city varchar, rider_id uuid, vehicle_id uuid, start_address varchar, end_address varchar, start_time timestamp, end_time timestamp, revenue decimal)
      │ estimated row count: 12,317
      │ filter: ((revenue)[decimal] > (90)[decimal])[bool]
      │
      └── • scan
            columns: (id uuid, city varchar, vehicle_city varchar, rider_id uuid, vehicle_id uuid, start_address varchar, end_address varchar, start_time timestamp, end_time timestamp, revenue decimal)
            estimated row count: 125,000 (100% of the table; stats collected 29 minutes ago)
            table: rides@primary
            spans: FULL SCAN
(19 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

### `OPT` option

The `OPT` option displays the statement plan tree generated by the [cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html). For example:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (OPT) SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 90 ORDER BY revenue ASC;
~~~

~~~
             info
-------------------------------
  sort
   └── select
        ├── scan rides
        └── filters
             └── revenue > 90
(5 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

<a name="opt-verbose-option"></a>

To include cost details used by the optimizer in planning the query, use `OPT, VERBOSE`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (OPT, VERBOSE) SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 90 ORDER BY revenue ASC;
~~~

~~~
                                 info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### `VEC` option

The `VEC` option shows details about the [vectorized execution plan](vectorized-execution.html#how-vectorized-execution-works) for the query.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (VEC) SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 90 ORDER BY revenue ASC;
~~~

~~~
                      info
------------------------------------------------
  │
  └ Node 1
    └ *colexec.sortOp
      └ *colexecsel.selGTDecimalDecimalConstOp
        └ *colfetcher.ColBatchScan
(5 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

The output shows the different internal functions that will be used to process each batch of column-oriented data.

### `DISTSQL` option

The `DISTSQL` option generates a URL for a physical statement plan that provides high level information about how a query will be executed. For details about reading the physical statement plan, see [DistSQL Plan Viewer](explain-analyze.html#distsql-plan-viewer). For more information about distributed SQL queries, see the [DistSQL section of our SQL Layer Architecture docs](architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/physical-plan-url.md %}
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For example, the following `EXPLAIN(DISTSQL)` statement generates a physical plan for a simple query against the [TPC-H database](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/) loaded to a 3-node CockroachDB cluster:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (DISTSQL) SELECT l_shipmode, AVG(l_extendedprice) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_shipmode;
~~~

~~~
 automatic |                      url
-----------+----------------------------------------------
   true    | https://cockroachdb.github.io/distsqlplan...
~~~

 To include the data types of the input columns in the physical plan, use `EXPLAIN(DISTSQL, TYPES)`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN (DISTSQL, TYPES) SELECT l_shipmode, AVG(l_extendedprice) FROM lineitem GROUP BY l_shipmode;
~~~

### Find the indexes and key ranges a query uses

You can use `EXPLAIN` to understand which indexes and key ranges queries use, which can help you ensure a query isn't performing a full table scan.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE kv (k INT PRIMARY KEY, v INT);
~~~

Because column `v` is not indexed, queries filtering on it alone scan the entire table:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM kv WHERE v BETWEEN 4 AND 5;
~~~

~~~
               info
-----------------------------------
  distribution: full
  vectorized: true

  • filter
  │ filter: (v >= 4) AND (v <= 5)
  │
  └── • scan
        missing stats
        table: kv@primary
        spans: FULL SCAN
(10 rows)

Time: 50ms total (execution 50ms / network 0ms)
~~~

 You can disable statement plans that perform full table scans with the `disallow_full_table_scans` [session variable](set-vars.html).

When `disallow_full_table_scans=on`, attempting to execute a query with a plan that includes a full table scan will return an error:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SET disallow_full_table_scans=on;
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM kv WHERE v BETWEEN 4 AND 5;
~~~

~~~
ERROR: query `SELECT * FROM kv WHERE v BETWEEN 4 AND 5` contains a full table/index scan which is explicitly disallowed
SQLSTATE: P0003
HINT: try overriding the `disallow_full_table_scans` cluster/session setting
~~~

If there were an index on `v`, CockroachDB would be able to avoid scanning the entire table:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE INDEX v ON kv (v);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM kv WHERE v BETWEEN 4 AND 5;
~~~

~~~
                                      info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  distribution: local
  vectorized: true

  • scan
    estimated row count: 1 (100% of the table; stats collected 11 seconds ago)
    table: kv@v
    spans: [/4 - /5]
(7 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

Now, only part of the index `v` is getting scanned, specifically the key range starting at (and including) 4 and stopping before 6. Also note that this statement plan is not distributed across nodes on the cluster.

### Find out if a statement is using `SELECT FOR UPDATE` locking

 CockroachDB has support for ordering transactions by controlling concurrent access to one or more rows of a table using locks. This "`SELECT FOR UPDATE` locking" can result in improved performance for contended operations. It applies to the following statements:

- [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](select-for-update.html)
- [`UPDATE`](update.html)

To see whether a SQL query using one of these statements is using this feature, check the output of `EXPLAIN` for a `locking strength` field as shown below. If the `locking strength` field does not appear, then the statement is not using this feature.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS kv (k INT PRIMARY KEY, v INT);
UPSERT INTO kv (k, v) VALUES (1, 5), (2, 10), (3, 15);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN UPDATE kv SET v = 100 WHERE k = 1;
~~~

~~~
                   info
------------------------------------------
  distribution: local
  vectorized: true

  • update
  │ table: kv
  │ set: v
  │ auto commit
  │
  └── • render
      │
      └── • scan
            missing stats
            table: kv@primary
            spans: [/1 - /1]
            locking strength: for update
(15 rows)

Time: 1ms total (execution 1ms / network 0ms)
~~~

By default, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` locking is enabled for the initial row scan of `UPDATE` and `UPSERT` statements.  To disable it, toggle the [`enable_implicit_select_for_update` session setting](show-vars.html#enable-implicit-select-for-update).
