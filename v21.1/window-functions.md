title: Window Functions
summary: A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.
toc: true
---

CockroachDB supports the application of a function over a subset of the rows returned by a [selection query][selection-query]. Such a function is known as a _window function_, and it allows you to compute values by operating on more than one row at a time. The subset of rows a window function operates on is known as a _window frame_.

For a complete list of supported window functions, see [Functions and Operators](functions-and-operators.html#window-functions).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
All [aggregate functions][aggregate-functions] can also be used as [window functions][window-functions]. For more information, see the [Examples](#examples) below.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Window definitions

Window frames are defined in [`OVER` clauses](sql-grammar.html#over_clause) or [`WINDOW` clauses](sql-grammar.html#window_clause).

## How window functions work

At a high level, window functions work by:

1. Creating a "virtual table" using a [selection query][selection-query].
2. Splitting that table into window frames with [window definitions](#window-definitions). You can define window frames in an [`OVER` clause](sql-grammar.html#over_clause), directly after the window function, or in a [`WINDOW` clause](sql-grammar.html#window_clause), as a part of the selection query.
3. Applying the window function to each of the window frames.

For example, consider a query where the window frames are defined for each window function call:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT DISTINCT(city),
             SUM(revenue) OVER () AS total_revenue,
             SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY city) AS city_revenue
            FROM rides
        ORDER BY city_revenue DESC;
~~~

Its operation can be described as follows (numbered steps listed here correspond to the numbers in the diagram below):

1. The outer `SELECT DISTINCT(city) ... FROM rides` creates a "virtual table" on which the window functions will operate.
2. The window function `SUM(revenue) OVER ()` operates on a window frame containing all rows of the query output.
3. The window function `SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY city)` operates on several window frames in turn; each frame contains the `revenue` columns for a different city [partition](partitioning.html) (Amsterdam, Boston, L.A., etc.).

### Caveats

The most important part of working with window functions is understanding what data will be in the frame that the window function will be operating on. By default, the window frame includes all of the rows of the partition. If you order the partition, the default frame includes all rows from the first row in the partition to the current row. In other words, adding an `ORDER BY` clause when you create the window frame (e.g., `PARTITION BY x ORDER by y`) has the following effects:

- It makes the rows inside the window frame ordered.
- It changes what rows the function is called on - no longer all of the rows in the window frame, but a subset between the "first" row and the current row.

Another way of saying this is that you can run a window function on either:

- All rows in the window frame created by the  `PARTITION BY` clause, e.g., `SELECT f(x) OVER () FROM z`.
- A subset of the rows in the window frame if the frame is created with `SELECT f(x) OVER (PARTITION BY x ORDER BY y) FROM z`.

Because of this, you should be aware of the behavior of any [aggregate function][aggregate-functions] you use as a [window function][window-functions]. If you are not seeing results you expect from a window function, this behavior may explain why. You may need to specify the frame boundaries explicitly in [the window definition](#window-definitions).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If you are running separate window functions over the same window frame, you can define the window frame once in a `WINDOW` clause, and then refer to the window by its name when you call the window function. For an example, see [Customers taking the most rides and generating the most revenue](#customers-taking-the-most-rides-and-generating-the-most-revenue).

### Customers taking the most rides

To see which customers have taken the most rides, run:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT distinct(name) as "name",
            COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY name) AS "number of rides"
     FROM users JOIN rides ON users.id = rides.rider_id)
  ORDER BY "number of rides" DESC LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
        name       | number of rides
+------------------+-----------------+
  Michael Brown    |              19
  Richard Bullock  |              17
  Judy White       |              15
  Patricia Herrera |              15
  Tony Ortiz       |              15

  Amy Cobb         |              13
(10 rows)
~~~

### Customers generating the most revenue

To see which customers have generated the most revenue, run:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT DISTINCT name,
    SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY name) AS "total rider revenue"
    FROM users JOIN rides ON users.id = rides.rider_id
    ORDER BY "total rider revenue" DESC
    LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
        name       | total rider revenue
+------------------+---------------------+
  Richard Bullock  |              952.00
  Patricia Herrera |              948.00

  Nicole Mcmahon   |              696.00
(10 rows)
~~~

### Add row numbers to query output

To add row numbers to the output, kick the previous query down into a subquery and run the `row_number()` window function.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT row_number() OVER (), *
  FROM (
		  SELECT DISTINCT
		         name,
		         sum(revenue) OVER (
					PARTITION BY name
		         ) AS "total rider revenue"
		    FROM users JOIN rides ON users.id = rides.rider_id
		ORDER BY "total rider revenue" DESC
		   LIMIT 10
       );
~~~

~~~
  row_number |       name       | total rider revenue
+------------+------------------+---------------------+
           1 | Richard Bullock  |              952.00
           2 | Patricia Herrera |              948.00
           3 | Maria Weber      |              903.00
           4 | Michael Brown    |              858.00
           5 | Judy White       |              818.00
           6 | Tyler Dalton     |              786.00
           7 | Samantha Coffey  |              758.00
           8 | Cindy Medina     |              740.00
           9 | Tony Ortiz       |              724.00
          10 | Nicole Mcmahon   |              696.00
(10 rows)
~~~

### Customers taking the most rides and generating the most revenue

To see which customers have taken the most rides while generating the most revenue, run:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT name,
      COUNT(*)     OVER w AS "number of rides",
      (SUM(revenue) OVER w)::DECIMAL(100,2) AS "total rider revenue"
      FROM users JOIN rides ON users.ID = rides.rider_id
      WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY name)
    )
  ORDER BY "number of rides" DESC,
           "total rider revenue" DESC
  LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
        name       | number of rides | total rider revenue
+------------------+-----------------+---------------------+
  Michael Brown    |              19 |              858.00
  Richard Bullock  |              17 |              952.00
  Patricia Herrera |              15 |              948.00
  Maria Weber      |              15 |              903.00
  Judy White       |              15 |              818.00
  Tony Ortiz       |              15 |              724.00
  Cindy Medina     |              14 |              740.00
  Tyler Dalton     |              13 |              786.00
  Samantha Coffey  |              13 |              758.00
  Nicole Mcmahon   |              13 |              696.00
(10 rows)
~~~

Note that in the query above, a `WINDOW` clause defines the window frame, and the `OVER` clauses reuse the window frame.

### Customers with the highest average revenue per ride

To see which customers have the highest average revenue per ride, run:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}

    COUNT(*)     OVER w AS "number of rides",
    AVG(revenue) OVER w AS "average revenue per ride"
    FROM users JOIN rides ON users.ID = rides.rider_id
    WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY name)
    ORDER BY "average revenue per ride" DESC, "number of rides" ASC
    LIMIT 10;

  )
  WHERE "number of rides" >= 10
  ORDER BY "average revenue per ride" DESC
  LIMIT 10;
