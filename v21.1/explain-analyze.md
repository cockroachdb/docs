title: EXPLAIN ANALYZE
summary: The EXPLAIN ANALYZE statement executes a query and generates a physical statement plan with execution statistics.
toc: true
---

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` [statement](sql-statements.html) **executes a SQL query** and generates a statement plan with execution statistics. The `(DEBUG)` option generates a URL to download a bundle with more details about the statement plan for advanced debugging. Statement plans provide information around SQL execution, which can be used to troubleshoot slow queries by figuring out where time is being spent, how long a processor (i.e., a component that takes streams of input rows and processes them according to a specification) is not doing work, etc. For more information about distributed SQL queries, see the [DistSQL section of our SQL Layer Architecture docs](architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql).

## Aliases

In CockroachDB, the following are aliases for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:

- `EXPLAIN ANALYSE`

## Synopsis

<div>{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/generated/diagrams/explain_analyze.html %}</div>

## Parameters

Parameter          | Description
-------------------|-----------
`PLAN`             | **New in v21.1:** <br /> _(Default)_ Executes the statement and returns CockroachDB's statement plan with planning and execution time for an [explainable statement](sql-grammar.html#preparable_stmt). For more information, see [Default option](#default-option).
`DISTSQL`          | Return the statement plan and performance statistics as well as a generated link to a graphical distributed SQL physical statement plan tree. For more information, see [`DISTSQL` option](#distsql-option).
`DEBUG`            |  Generate a ZIP file containing files with detailed information about the query and the database objects referenced in the query. For more information, see [`DEBUG` option](#debug-option).
`preparable_stmt`  | The [statement](sql-grammar.html#preparable_stmt) you want to execute and analyze. All preparable statements are explainable.

## Required privileges

The user requires the appropriate [privileges](authorization.html#assign-privileges) for the statement being explained.

## Success responses

Successful `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statements return tables with the following details in the `info` column:

 Detail | Description
--------|------------
[Global properties](#global-properties) | The properties and statistics that apply to the entire statement plan.
[Statement plan tree](#statement-plan-tree-properties) | A tree representation of the hierarchy of the statement plan.
Node details | The properties, columns, and ordering details for the current statement plan node in the tree.
Time | The time details for the statement. The total time is the planning and execution time of the statement. The execution time is the time it took for the final statement plan to complete. The network time is the amount of time it took to distribute the statement across the relevant nodes in the cluster. Some statements do not need to be distributed, so the network time is 0ms.

If you use the `DISTSQL` option, the statement will also return a URL generated for a physical statement plan that provides high level information about how a statement will be executed. For details about reading the physical statement plan, see [DistSQL Plan Viewer](#distsql-plan-viewer).<br><br>{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/physical-plan-url.md %} {{site.data.alerts.end}}

If you use the [`DEBUG` option](#debug-option), the statement will return a single `text` column with a URL and instructions to download the `DEBUG` bundle, which includes the physical statement plan.

### Global properties

Global property | Description
----------------|------------
planning time | The total time the planner took to create a statement plan.
execution time | The time it took for the final statement plan to complete.
distribution | Shows whether the statement was distributed or local. If `distribution` is `full`, execution of the statement is performed by multiple nodes in parallel, then the results are returned by the gateway node. If `local`, the execution plan is performed only on the gateway node. Even if the execution plan is `local`, row data may be fetched from remote nodes, but the processing of the data is performed by the local node.
vectorized | Indicates whether the [vectorized execution engine](vectorized-execution.html) was used in this statement.
rows read from KV | The number of rows read from the [Storage layer](architecture/storage-layer.html).
cumulative time spent in KV | The total amount of time spent in the [Storage layer](architecture/storage-layer.html).
cumulative time spent due to contention | The total amount of time this statement was in contention with another transaction during execution.
maximum memory usage | The maximum amount of memory used by this statement anytime during its execution.
network usage | The amount of data transferred over the network while the statement was executed. If this value is 0 B, the statement was executed on a single node and didn't use the network.

### Statement plan tree properties

The statement plan tree shows

Statement plan tree properties | Description
-------------------------------|------------
processor | Each processor in the statement plan hierarchy has a node with details about that phase of the statement. For example, a statement with a `GROUP BY` clause has a `group` processor with details about the cluster nodes, rows, and operations related to the `GROUP BY` operation.
nodes | The names of the CockroachDB cluster nodes affected by this phase of the statement.
regions | The [regions](show-regions.html) where the affected nodes were located.
actual row count | The actual number of rows affected by this processor during execution.
estimated row count | The estimated number of rows affected by this processor according to the statement planner.
KV rows read | During scans, the number of rows in the [Storage layer](architecture/storage-layer.html) read by this phase of the statement.
KV bytes read | During scans, the amount of data read from the [Storage layer](architecture/storage-layer.html) during this phase of the statement.
table | The table and index used in a scan operation in a statement, in the form `{table name}@{index name}`.
spans | The interval of the key space read by the processor. If `spans` is `FULL SCAN` the table is scanned on all key ranges of the index. If `spans` is `[/1 - /1]` only the key with value `1` is read by the processor.

## Default option

{% include_cached new-in.html version="v21.1" %} By default, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` uses the `PLAN` option. `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (PLAN)` produce the same output.

## `DISTSQL` option

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` generates a physical statement plan diagram in the [DistSQL Plan Viewer](#distsql-plan-viewer). The DistSQL Plan Viewer displays the physical statement plan, as well as execution statistics. The statistics listed depend on the query type and the [execution engine used](vectorized-execution.html). There will be multiple diagrams if the query contains subqueries or post-queries.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
{% include_cached new-in.html version="v21.1" %} `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` can only be used as the top-level statement in a query.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## `DEBUG` option

 `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)` executes a query and generates a link to a ZIP file that contains the [physical statement plan](#distsql-plan-viewer), execution statistics, statement tracing, and other information about the query.

        File        | Description

### `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` without an option, or equivalently with the `PLAN` option, to execute a query and display the physical statement plan with execution statistics.

For example, the following `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement executes a simple query against the [MovR database](movr.html) and then displays the physical statement plan with execution statistics:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT city, AVG(revenue) FROM rides GROUP BY city;
