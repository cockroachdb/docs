summary: How to configure CockroachDB logs with the --log flag and YAML payload.
toc: true
---

This page describes how to configure CockroachDB logs with the [`--log` flag](cockroach-start.html#logging) and a [YAML payload](#yaml-payload). Most logging behaviors are configurable, including:

- The [logging sinks](#configure-logging-sinks) that output logs to different locations, including over the network.
- The [logging channels](logging-overview.html#logging-channels) that are mapped to each sink.
- The [format](logformats.html) used by the log messages.
- The [redaction](#redact-logs) of log messages.

For examples of how these settings can be used in practice, see [Logging Use Cases](logging-use-cases.html) and [Parse Logging Output](parse-logging-output.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The logging flags previously used with `cockroach` commands are now deprecated. Instead, use the YAML definitions as described below. The [default logging configuration](#default-logging-configuration) uses YAML settings that are backward-compatible with v20.2 and earlier.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Flag

To configure the logging behavior of a `cockroach` command, pass `--log={yaml}` with the command, where `{yaml}` is the [YAML payload](#yaml-payload).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
All [`cockroach` commands](cockroach-commands.html) support logging and can be configured with `--log`. However, note that most messages related to cluster operation are generated by [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) or [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html). Other commands generate messages related to their own execution, which are mainly useful when troubleshooting the behaviors of those commands.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## YAML payload

All log settings for a `cockroach` command are specified with a YAML payload, which you can pass with the `--log` flag in two ways:

- Block format, where each parameter is written on a separate line. For example, after creating a file `logs.yaml`:

	~~~ shell
	$ cockroach start-single-node --certs-dir=certs --log="$(cat logs.yaml)"
	~~~

- Inline format, where all parameters are specified on one line. For example, to generate an `ops` log file that collects the `OPS` and `HEALTH` channels (overriding the file groups defined for those channels in the [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration)):

	~~~ shell
	$ cockroach start-single-node --certs-dir=certs --log="sinks: {file-groups: {ops: {channels: [OPS, HEALTH]}}}"
	~~~

	Note that the inline spaces must be preserved.

For clarity, this article uses the block format to describe the YAML payload, which has the overall structure:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...       # defaults inherited by file sinks
fluent-defaults: ...     # defaults inherited by network sinks
sinks:
   file-groups: ...      # file sink definitions
   fluent-servers: ...   # network sink definitions
   stderr: ...           # stderr sink definitions
stray-error-capture: ... # parameters for the stray error capture system
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Providing a logging configuration is optional. Any fields included in the YAML payload will override the [default logging configuration](#default-logging-configuration).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
You can view your current settings by running `cockroach debug check-log-config`, which returns the YAML definitions and a URL to a visualization of the current logging configuration.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Configure logging sinks

Logging *sinks* route events from specified [logging channels](logging-overview.html#logging-channels) to destinations outside CockroachDB. These destinations currently include [log files](#output-to-files), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)-compatible [servers](#output-to-network), and the [standard error stream (`stderr`)](#output-to-stderr).

All supported output destinations are configured under `sinks`:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  file-groups:
    {file group name}:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
  fluent-servers:
    {server name}:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
  stderr:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
~~~

<a name="common-sink-parameters">

All supported sink types use the following common parameters.

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filter`        | Minimum severity level at which logs enter the channel. Accepts one of the valid [severity levels](logging.html#logging-levels) or `NONE`, which excludes all messages from the sink output. For details, see [Set logging levels](#set-logging-levels).                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `format`        | Log message format to use. Accepts one of the valid [log formats](logformats.html). For details, see [file logging format](#file-logging-format) and [network logging format](#network-logging-format).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `redact`        | When `true`, enables automatic redaction of personally identifiable information (PII) from log messages. This ensures that sensitive data is not transmitted when collecting logs centrally or [over a network](#output-to-network). For details, see [Redact logs](#redact-logs).                                                                                                                                           |
| `redactable`    | When `true`, preserves redaction markers around fields that are considered sensitive in the log messages. The markers are recognized by [`cockroach debug zip`](cockroach-debug-zip.html) and [`cockroach debug merge-logs`](cockroach-debug-merge-logs.html) but may not be compatible with external log collectors. For details on how the markers appear in each format, see [Log formats](logformats.html).              |
| `exit-on-error` | When `true`, stops the Cockroach node if an error is encountered while writing to the sink. We recommend enabling this option on file sinks in order to avoid losing any log entries. When set to `false`, this can be used to mark certain sinks (such as `stderr`) as non-critical.                                                                                                                                        |
| `auditable`     | If `true`, enables `exit-on-error` on the sink. Also disables `buffered-writes` if the sink is under `file-groups`. This guarantees [non-repudiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) for any logs in the sink, but can incur a performance overhead and higher disk IOPS consumption. This setting is typically enabled for [security-related logs](logging-use-cases.html#security-and-audit-monitoring). |





If not specified for a given sink, these parameter values are inherited from [`file-defaults`](#set-file-defaults) (for file sinks) and [`fluent-defaults`](#set-network-defaults) (for network sinks).

### Output to files

CockroachDB can write messages to one or more log files.

The channels that output to a log file are specified in its file sink configuration in `file-groups`. For example:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  file-groups:
    default:
      channels: [DEV]
    health:
      channels: [HEALTH]
      dir: health-logs
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
A file group name is arbitrary and is used to name the log files. The `default` file group is an exception. For details, see [Log file naming](#log-file-naming).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

File groups accept the following parameters along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters). 

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`        | List of channels that output to this sink. Use a YAML array or string of [channel names](logging-overview.html#logging-channels), `ALL` to include all channels, or `ALL EXCEPT {channels}` to include all channels except the specified channel names.<br><br>For more details on acceptable syntax, see [Logging sinks](logsinks.html#channel-format).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `dir`             | Output directory for log files generated by this sink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `max-file-size`   | Approximate maximum size of individual files generated by this sink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `max-group-size`  | Approximate maximum combined size of all files to be preserved for this sink. An asynchronous garbage collection removes files that cause the file set to grow beyond this specified size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `buffered-writes` | When `true`, enables buffering of writes. Set to `false` to flush every log entry (i.e., propagate data from the `cockroach` process to the OS) and synchronize writes (i.e., ask the OS to confirm the log data was written to disk). Disabling this setting provides [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) guarantees, but can incur a performance overhead and higher disk IOPS consumption. This setting is typically disabled for [security-related logs](logging-use-cases.html#security-and-audit-monitoring). |

If not specified for a given file group, the parameter values are inherited from [`file-defaults`](#configure-logging-defaults) (except `channels`, which uses the [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration)).

#### Log file naming

Log files are named in the following format:

~~~
{process}-{file group}.{host}.{user}.{start timestamp in UTC}.{process ID}.log
~~~

For example, a file group `health` will generate a log file that looks like this:

~~~
cockroach-health.work-laptop.worker.2021-03-15T15_24_10Z.024338.log
~~~

For each file group, a symlink points to the latest generated log file. It's easiest to refer to the symlink. For example:

~~~
cockroach-health.log
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The files generated for a group named `default` are named after the pattern `cockroach.{metadata}.log`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Output to network

CockroachDB can send logs over the network to a [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)-compatible log collector (e.g., [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)). The channels that output to a server are specified along with its network address and port in `fluent-servers`. For example:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  fluent-servers:
    health:
      channels: [HEALTH]
      address: 127.0.0.1:5170
    ...
~~~

Fluentd servers accept the following parameters along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters).

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`      | List of channels that output to this sink. Use a YAML array or string of [channel names](logging-overview.html#logging-channels), `ALL` to include all channels, or `ALL EXCEPT {channels}` to include all channels except the specified channel names.<br><br>For more details on acceptable syntax, see [Logging sinks](logsinks.html#channel-format). |
| `address` | Network address and port of the log collector.                                                                     |
| `net`     | Network protocol to use. Can be `tcp`, `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp`, `udp4`, `udp6`, or `unix`.<br><br>**Default:** `tcp` |

For an example of collecting logs over a network, see [Parse Logging Output](parse-logging-output.html). Further details about the network implementation are in [Logging sinks](logsinks.html#output-to-fluentd-compatible-log-collectors).

### Output to `stderr`

CockroachDB can output messages to the [standard error stream (`stderr`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)), which prints them to the machine's terminal but does not store them. The channels that output to the stream are specified in the `stderr` field. For example:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  stderr:
    channels: [DEV]
~~~

The `stderr` configuration accepts the following parameters along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters).

| Parameter  | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`      | List of channels that output to this sink. Use a YAML array or string of [channel names](logging-overview.html#logging-channels), `ALL` to include all channels, or `ALL EXCEPT {channels}` to include all channels except the specified channel names.<br><br>For more details on acceptable syntax, see [Logging sinks](logsinks.html#channel-format). |
| `no-color` | When `true`, removes terminal color [escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) from the output. |

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
By default, `cockroach start` and `cockroach start-single-node` do not print any messages to `stderr`. However, if the `cockroach` process does not have access to on-disk storage, all messages are printed to `stderr`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Configure logging defaults

When setting up a logging configuration, it's simplest to define shared parameters in `file-defaults` and `fluent-defaults` and override specific values as needed in [`file-groups`](#output-to-files), [`fluent-servers`](#output-to-network), and [`stderr`](#output-to-stderr). For a complete example, see the [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration).

This section describes some recommended defaults.

### Set file defaults

Defaults for log files are set in `file-defaults`, which accepts all [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters) and the [file group parameters](#output-to-files) `dir`, `max-file-size`, `max-group-size`, and `buffered-writes`.

#### Logging directory

By default, CockroachDB adds log files to a `logs` subdirectory in the first on-disk [`store` directory](cockroach-start.html#store) (default: `cockroach-data`):

~~~
/cockroach-data/logs
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Each Cockroach node generates log files in the directory specified by its logging configuration. These logs detail the internal activity of that node without visibility into the behavior of other nodes. When troubleshooting, it's best to refer to the output directory for the cluster log files, which collect the messages from all active nodes.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

In cloud deployments, the main data store will be subject to an IOPS budget. Adding logs to the store directory will excessively consume IOPS. For this reason, cloud deployments should output log files to a separate directory with fewer IOPS restrictions. You can override the default logging directory like this:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  dir: /custom/dir/path/
~~~

#### DEV channel

The `DEV` channel is used for debug and uncategorized messages. It can therefore be noisy and contain sensitive (PII) information. 

We recommend configuring `DEV` separately from the other logging channels. When sending logs [over the network](#output-to-network), `DEV` logs should also be excluded from network collection. 

In this example, the `dev` file group is reserved for `DEV` logs. These are output to a `cockroach-dev.log` file in a custom disk `dir`:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  file-groups:
    dev:
      channels: [DEV]
    dir: /custom/dir/path/
	...
  fluent-servers:
    ...
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To ensure that you are protecting sensitive information, also [redact your logs](#redact-logs).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### File logging format

The default message format for log files is [`crdb-v2`](logformats.html#format-crdb-v2). Each `crdb-v2` log message starts with a flat prefix that contains event metadata (e.g., severity, date, timestamp, channel), followed by the event payload. For details on the metadata, see [Log formats](logformats.html#format-crdb-v2).

If you plan to read logs programmatically, you can switch to a [JSON](logformats.html#format-json) or [compact JSON](logformats.html#format-json-compact) format:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  format: json
~~~

JSON uses a structured format that can be easily parsed by an external service. For an example, see [Parse Logging Output](parse-logging-output.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`format` refers to the envelope of the log message, which contains the event metadata. This is separate from the event payload, which corresponds to its [event type](eventlog.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Set network defaults

Defaults for network sinks are set in `fluent-defaults`, which accepts all [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters).

Note that the [server parameters](#output-to-network) `address` and `net` are *not* specified in `fluent-defaults`:

- `address` must be specified for each sink under `fluent-servers`.
- `net` is not required and defaults to `tcp`.

#### Network logging format

The default message format for network output is [`json-fluent-compact`](logformats.html#format-json-fluent-compact). Each log message is structured as a JSON payload that can be read programmatically. The `json-fluent-compact` and [`json-fluent`](logformats.html#format-json-fluent) formats include a `tag` field that is required by the [Fluentd protocol](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file). For details, see [Log formats](logformats.html#format-json-fluent-compact).

~~~ yaml
fluent-defaults:
  format: json-fluent
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`format` refers to the envelope of the log message. This is separate from the event payload, which is structured according to [event type](eventlog.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For an example of sending logs to an external log collector, see [Parse Logging Output](parse-logging-output.html).

### Set logging levels

Log messages are associated with a [severity level](logging.html#logging-levels) when they are generated. Each logging sink is configured to output messages that meet a minimum severity level, specified with `filter`. Messages with severity levels below the `filter` threshold do not enter logging channels and are discarded.

The [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration) uses the following severity levels for [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html):

- File and network sinks emit messages with `INFO` severity or higher. Since `INFO` is the lowest severity level, this includes all log messages.
- `stderr` is configured with `filter: NONE` and does not emit log messages.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
All other `cockroach` commands use `filter: WARNING` and log to `stderr` by default, with these exceptions:

- [`cockroach workload`](cockroach-sql.html#logging) uses `filter: INFO`.
- [`cockroach demo`](cockroach-demo.html#logging) uses `filter: NONE` (discards all log messages).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

You can override the default severity levels on a per-sink basis. For example, use `filter: NONE` to disable logging for certain channels:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  file-groups:
    dev:
      channels: [DEV]
      filter: NONE
~~~

### Redact logs

CockroachDB can redact personally identifiable information (PII) from log messages. The logging system includes two parameters that handle this differently:

- `redact` is disabled by default. When enabled, `redact` automatically redacts sensitive data from logging output. We do *not* recommend enabling this on the `DEV` channel because it impairs our ability to troubleshoot problems.
- `redactable` is enabled by default. This places redaction markers around sensitive fields in log messages. These markers are recognized by [`cockroach debug zip`](cockroach-debug-zip.html) and [`cockroach debug merge-logs`](cockroach-debug-merge-logs.html), which aggregate CockroachDB log files and can be instructed to redact sensitive data from their output. 

When collecting logs centrally (e.g., in data mining scenarios where non-privileged users have access to logs) or over a network (e.g., to an external log collector), it's safest to enable `redact`:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  redact: true
fluent-defaults:
  redact: true
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
In addition, the `DEV` channel should be output to a separate logging directory, since it is likely to contain sensitive data. See [`DEV` channel](#dev-channel).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

External log collectors can misinterpret the `cockroach debug` redaction markers, since they are specific to CockroachDB. To prevent this issue when using network sinks, disable `redactable`:

~~~ yaml
fluent-defaults:
  redactable: false
~~~

## Stray error capture

Certain events, such as uncaught software exceptions (panics), bypass the CockroachDB logging system. However, they can be useful in troubleshooting. For example, if CockroachDB crashes, it normally logs a stack trace to what caused the problem. 

To ensure that these stray errors can be tracked, CockroachDB does not send them to `stderr` by default. Instead, stray errors are output to a `cockroach-stderr.log` file in the default [logging directory](#logging-directory).

You can change these settings in `capture-stray-errors`:

~~~ yaml
capture-stray-errors:
  enable: true
  dir: /custom/dir/path/
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
When `capture-stray-errors` is disabled, [`redactable`](#redact-logs) cannot be enabled on the `stderr` sink. This is because `stderr` will contain both stray errors and logged events and cannot apply redaction markers in a reliable way. Note that [`redact`](#redact-logs) can still be enabled on `stderr` in this case.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Default logging configuration

The YAML payload below represents the default logging behavior of [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html). To retain backward compatibility with v20.2 and earlier, these settings match the [log filenames used in previous versions](logging-overview.html#changes-to-logging-system).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
These `file-groups` defaults will be removed in v21.2.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  max-file-size: 10MiB
  max-group-size: 100MiB
  buffered-writes: true
  filter: INFO
  format: crdb-v2
  redact: false
  redactable: true
  exit-on-error: true
  auditable: false
fluent-defaults:
  filter: INFO
  format: json-fluent-compact
  redact: false
  redactable: true
  exit-on-error: false
  auditable: false
sinks:
  file-groups:
    default:
      channels: [DEV, OPS, HEALTH, SQL_SCHEMA, USER_ADMIN, PRIVILEGES]
    pebble:
      channels: [STORAGE]
    sql-audit:
      channels: [SENSITIVE_ACCESS]
    sql-auth:
      channels: [SESSIONS]
    sql-exec:
      channels: [SQL_EXEC]
    sql-slow:
      channels: [SQL_PERF]
    sql-slow-internal-only:
      channels: [SQL_INTERNAL_PERF]
  stderr:
    channels: all
    filter: NONE
    format: crdb-v2-tty
    redact: false
    redactable: true
    exit-on-error: true
capture-stray-errors:
  enable: true
  max-group-size: 100MiB
~~~

Note that a default `dir` is not specified for `file-defaults` and `capture-stray-errors`:

- The default `dir` for `file-defaults` is inferred from the first on-disk [`store` directory](cockroach-start.html#store). See [Logging directory](#logging-directory).
- The default `dir` for `capture-stray-errors` is inherited form `file-defaults`.
