title: Functions and Operators
summary: CockroachDB supports many built-in functions, aggregate functions, and operators.
toc: true
---

CockroachDB supports the following SQL functions and operators for use in [scalar expressions](scalar-expressions.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}In the <a href="cockroach-sql.html#help">built-in SQL shell</a>, use <code>\hf [function]</code> to get inline help about a specific function.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Special syntax forms

The following syntax forms are recognized for compatibility with the
SQL standard and PostgreSQL, but are equivalent to regular built-in
functions:

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/function-special-forms.md %}

## Conditional and function-like operators

The following table lists the operators that look like built-in
functions but have special evaluation rules:

 Operator | Description
----------|-------------
 `ANNOTATE_TYPE(...)` | [Explicitly Typed Expression](scalar-expressions.html#explicitly-typed-expressions)
 `ARRAY(...)` | [Conversion of Subquery Results to An Array](scalar-expressions.html#conversion-of-subquery-results-to-an-array)
 `ARRAY[...]` | [Conversion of Scalar Expressions to An Array](scalar-expressions.html#array-constructors)
 `CAST(...)` | [Type Cast](scalar-expressions.html#explicit-type-coercions)
 `COALESCE(...)` | [First non-NULL expression with Short Circuit](scalar-expressions.html#coalesce-and-ifnull-expressions)
 `EXISTS(...)` | [Existence Test on the Result of Subqueries](scalar-expressions.html#existence-test-on-the-result-of-subqueries)
 `IF(...)` | [Conditional Evaluation](scalar-expressions.html#if-expressions)
 `IFNULL(...)` | Alias for `COALESCE` restricted to two operands
 `NULLIF(...)` | [Return `NULL` conditionally](scalar-expressions.html#nullif-expressions)
 `ROW(...)` | [Tuple Constructor](scalar-expressions.html#tuple-constructor)

## Aggregate functions

For examples showing how to use aggregate functions, see [the `SELECT` clause documentation](select-clause.html#aggregate-functions).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Non-commutative aggregate functions are sensitive to the order in which the rows are processed in the surrounding [`SELECT` clause](select-clause.html#aggregate-functions). To specify the order in which input rows are processed, you can add an [`ORDER BY`](order-by.html) clause within the function argument list. For examples, see the [`SELECT` clause](select-clause.html#order-aggregate-function-input-rows-by-column) documentation.

## Operators

The following table lists all CockroachDB operators from highest to lowest precedence, i.e., the order in which they will be evaluated within a statement. Operators with the same precedence are left associative. This means that those operators are grouped together starting from the left and moving right.

| Order of Precedence | Operator | Name | Operator Arity |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---- | -------------- |
| 1 | `.` | Member field access operator | binary |
| 2 | `::` | [Type cast](scalar-expressions.html#explicit-type-coercions) | binary |
| 3 | `-` | Unary minus | unary (prefix) |
|  | `~` | Bitwise not | unary (prefix) |
| 4 | `^` | Exponentiation | binary |
| 5 | `*` | Multiplication | binary |
|  | `/` | Division | binary |
|  | `//` | Floor division | binary |
|  | `%` | Modulo | binary |
| 6 | `+` | Addition | binary |
|  | `-` | Subtraction | binary |
| 7 | `<<` | Bitwise left-shift | binary |
|  | `>>` | Bitwise right-shift | binary |
| 8 | `&` | Bitwise AND | binary |
| 9 | `#` | Bitwise XOR | binary |
| 10 | <code>&#124;</code> | Bitwise OR | binary |
| 11 | <code>&#124;&#124;</code> | Concatenation | binary |
|    | `< ANY`, ` SOME`, ` ALL` | [Multi-valued] "less than" comparison | binary |
|    | `> ANY`, ` SOME`, ` ALL` | [Multi-valued] "greater than" comparison | binary |
|    | `= ANY`, ` SOME`, ` ALL` | [Multi-valued] "equal" comparison | binary |
|    | `<= ANY`, ` SOME`, ` ALL` | [Multi-valued] "less than or equal" comparison | binary |
|    | `>= ANY`, ` SOME`, ` ALL` | [Multi-valued] "greater than or equal" comparison | binary |
|    | `<> ANY` / `!= ANY`, `<> SOME` / `!= SOME`, `<> ALL` / `!= ALL` | [Multi-valued] "not equal" comparison | binary |
|    | `[NOT] LIKE ANY`, `[NOT] LIKE SOME`, `[NOT] LIKE ALL` | [Multi-valued] `LIKE` comparison | binary |
|    | `[NOT] ILIKE ANY`, `[NOT] ILIKE SOME`, `[NOT] ILIKE ALL` | [Multi-valued] `ILIKE` comparison | binary |
| 12 | `[NOT] BETWEEN` | Value is [not] within the range specified | binary |
|  | `[NOT] BETWEEN SYMMETRIC` | Like `[NOT] BETWEEN`, but in non-sorted order. For example, whereas `a BETWEEN b AND c` means `b <= a <= c`, `a BETWEEN SYMMETRIC b AND c` means `(b <= a <= c) OR (c <= a <= b)`. | binary |
|  | `[NOT] IN` | Value is [not] in the set of values specified | binary |
|  | `[NOT] LIKE` | Matches [or not] LIKE expression, case sensitive  | binary |
|  | `[NOT] ILIKE` | Matches [or not] LIKE expression, case insensitive | binary |
|  | `[NOT] SIMILAR` | Matches [or not] SIMILAR TO regular expression | binary |
|  | `~` | Matches regular expression, case sensitive | binary |
|  | `!~` | Does not match regular expression, case sensitive | binary |
|  | `~*` | Matches regular expression, case insensitive | binary |
|  | `!~*` | Does not match regular expression, case insensitive | binary |
| 13 | `=` | Equal | binary |
|  | `<` | Less than | binary |
|  | `>` | Greater than | binary |
|  | `<=` | Less than or equal to | binary |
|  | `>=` | Greater than or equal to | binary |
|  | `!=`, `<>` | Not equal | binary |
| 14 | `IS [DISTINCT FROM]` | Equal, considering `NULL` as value | binary |
|  | `IS NOT [DISTINCT FROM]` | `a IS NOT b` equivalent to `NOT (a IS b)` | binary |
|  | `ISNULL`, `IS UNKNOWN` , `NOTNULL`, `IS NOT UNKNOWN` | Equivalent to `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` | unary (postfix) |
|  | `IS NAN`, `IS NOT NAN` | [Comparison with the floating-point NaN value](scalar-expressions.html#comparison-with-nan) | unary (postfix) |
|  | `IS OF(...)` | Type predicate | unary (postfix)
| 15 | `NOT` | [Logical NOT](scalar-expressions.html#logical-operators) | unary |
| 16 | `AND` | [Logical AND](scalar-expressions.html#logical-operators) | binary |
| 17 | `OR` | [Logical OR](scalar-expressions.html#logical-operators) | binary |

### Supported operations

<!--
## `CAST()`

there are three syntaxes for dates: `'2016-01-01'::date`, `CAST('2016-01-01' AS DATE)`, and `DATE '2016-01-01'`. the docs should probably prefer the latter form

the `CAST()` function should get its own documentation somewhere; Iâ€™m not sure if it needs to be mentioned again in the date section. The `::` form should probably only be mentioned as an alternative to `CAST()`
