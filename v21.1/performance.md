CockroachDB delivers predictable throughput and latency at all scales on commodity hardware. This page provides an overview of the performance profiles you can expect, based on Cockroach Labs' extensive testing using industry-standard benchmarks like TPC-C and Sysbench.

For instructions to reproduce the TPC-C results listed here, see [Performance Benchmarking with TPC-C](performance-benchmarking-with-tpcc-large.html). If you fail to achieve similar results, there is likely a problem in either the hardware, workload, or test design. Instructions to reproduce Sysbench and KV results are coming soon.

## Scale

TPC-C provides the most realistic and objective measure for OLTP performance at various scale factors, and CockroachDB can process **1.68M tpmC with 140,000 warehouses, resulting in an efficiency score of 95%.** As shown in the chart below, this is a 40% improvement over the results from CockroachDB 19.2.

For a refresher on what exactly TPC-C is and how it is measured, see [Benchmarks used](#benchmarks-used) below.

CockroachDB achieves this performance in [`SERIALIZABLE` isolation](demo-serializable.html), the strongest isolation level in the SQL standard.

| Metric                                          | CockroachDB 19.2 | CockroachDB 21.1 |
|-------------------------------------------------+------------------+------------------|
| Max warehouses with max efficiency (warehouses) |          100,000 |          140,000 |
| Max throughput (tpmC)                           |        1,245,462 |        1,684,437 |
| Efficiency (%)                                  |            98.81 |            95.45 |
| Max number of rows (billion)                    |             49.8 |             69.7 |
| Max unreplicated data (TB)                      |                8 |             11.2 |
| p95 latency for New Order transactions (ms)     |           486.50 |           2684.4 |
| Number of nodes                                 |               81 |               81 |

### Linear scaling

CockroachDB has **no theoretical scaling limit** and, in practice, can achieve near-linear performance at 256 nodes. Because the TPC-C results above reflect leaps in scale, to test linear scaling, Cockroach Labs ran a simple benchmark named KV 95 (95% point reads, 5% point writes, all uniformly distributed) on AWS `c5d.4xlarge` machines:

<img src="{{ 'images/v21.1/linearscale.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CRDB Linear Scale" style="max-width:100%" />

This chart shows that adding nodes increases throughput linearly while holding p50 and p99 latency constant. The concurrency for each scale was chosen to optimize throughput while maintaining an acceptable latency and can be observed in the table below.

| Number of Nodes | Workers | Concurrency |
|-----------------+---------+-------------|
|              16 |       2 |         512 |
|              32 |       4 |         512 |
|              64 |       4 |        1024 |
|             128 |       8 |        1024 |
|             256 |       8 |        2048 |

## Throughput

As mentioned above, Cockroach Labs believes TPC-C provides the most realistic and objective measure for OLTP throughput. In the real world, applications generate transactional workloads that consist of a combination of reads and writes, possibly with concurrency and likely without all data being loaded into memory. If you see benchmark results quoted in QPS, take them with a grain of salt, because anything as simple as a “query” is unlikely to be representative of the workload you need to run in practice.

With that in mind, however, you can use [Sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) for straight-forward throughput benchmarking. For example, on a 3-node cluster of AWS `c5d.9xlarge` machines across AWS’s `us-east-1` region (availability zones `a`, `b`, and `c`), CockroachDB can achieve 118,000 inserts per second on the `oltp_insert` workload and 336,000 reads per second on the `oltp_point_select` workload. We used a concurrency of 480 on the `oltp_insert` workload and a concurrency of 216 on the `oltp_point_select` workload to generate these numbers.

## Latency

CockroachDB returns single-row **reads in 1 ms** and processes single-row **writes in 2 ms** within a single availability zone. As you expand out to multiple availability zones or multiple regions, latency can increase due to distance and the limitation of the speed of light.

For benchmarking latency, again, Cockroach Labs believes TPC-C provides the most realistic and objective measure, since it encompasses the latency distribution, including tail performance. However, you can use [Sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) for straight-forward latency benchmarking.

For example, when running Sysbench on a 3-node cluster of AWS `c5d.9xlarge` machines across AWS’s `us-east-1` region (availability zones `a`, `b`, and `c`), CockroachDB can achieve an average of 4.3ms on the `oltp_insert` workload and 0.7ms on the `oltp_point_select` workload.

<img src="{{ 'images/v21.1/sysbench-latency.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Sysbench Latency" style="max-width:100%" />

CockroachDB provides a number of important tuning practices for both single-region and multi-region deployments, including [secondary indexes](indexes.html) and various [data topologies](topology-patterns.html) to achieve low latency.

## Benchmarks used

### TPC-C

Cockroach Labs measures performance through many diverse tests, including the [industry-standard OLTP benchmark TPC-C](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/), which simulates an e-commerce or retail company. Created in 1992, TPC-C has withstood the test of time and remains the most mature industry benchmark for OLTP workloads, and **the only objective comparison for evaluating OLTP performance**. In its own words, TPC-C:

>“…involves a mix of five concurrent transactions of different types and complexity either executed on-line or queued for deferred execution. The database is comprised of nine types of tables with a wide range of record and population sizes. While the benchmark portrays the activity of a wholesale supplier, TPC-C is not limited to the activity of any particular business segment, but, rather represents any industry that must manage, sell, or distribute a product or service.”

As a result, TPC-C includes create, read, update, and delete (e.g., CRUD) queries, basic joins, and other SQL statements used to administer mission-critical transactional workloads. It includes detailed specifications for concurrency and workload contention.

#### How TPC-C works

TPC-C measures the throughput and latency for processing sales through a customer warehouse using a “business throughput” metric called **tpmC** that measures the number of order transactions performed per minute throughout the system. This metric is considerably more realistic than TPS (transactions per second) or QPS (queries per second) alone because it summarizes multiple transactions per order and accounts for failed transactions. TPC-C also has several latency requirements that apply to median, p90, and max latencies.

TPC-C specifies restrictions on the maximum throughput achievable per warehouse. This is done to ensure that as a system becomes progressively more capable of throughput, it must also deal with progressively more data. This is how things work in the real world, and it makes little sense to say that your database can process a bazillion transactions per second if it’s processing the same data over and over again.

Because TPC-C is constrained to a maximum amount of throughput per warehouse, we often discuss TPC-C performance as the **maximum number of warehouses for which a database can maintain the maximum throughput per minute.** For a full description of the benchmark, please consult the [official documentation](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-c_v5.11.0.pdf).

### Sysbench

[Sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) is a popular tool that allows for basic throughput and latency testing. Cockroach Labs prefers the more complex TPC-C, as discussed above, but Sysbench’s `oltp_insert` and `oltp_point_select` workloads are reasonable alternatives for understanding basic throughput and latency across different databases.

## Performance limitations

CockroachDB has no theoretical limitations to scaling, throughput, latency, or concurrency other than the speed of light. Practically, we will be improving bottlenecks and addressing challenges over the next several releases.
