### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- Numeric literals containing a decimal point are now treated as type [`DECIMAL`](decimal.html) instead of type [`FLOAT`](float.html), unless type inference determines that `FLOAT` should be used. In some cases, an explicit `CAST(x AS FLOAT)` may be needed. [#6752](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6752)
- The custom error codes `CR000` (indicating a transaction needs to be [retried](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/transactions.html#transaction-retries)) and `CR001` (indicating a transaction is in an invalid state) have been replaced with the PostgreSQL standard error codes `40001` (serialization failure) and `25000` (invalid transaction state), respectively. [#6797](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6797)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed problems when tables are renamed or dropped and recreated in rapid succession. [#6595](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6595)
- [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.html) now works correctly with quoted names. [#6851](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6851)
- Gracefully shutting down a node now completes faster. [#6777](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6777)
- [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`](insert.html) no longer crashes the server when no conflicting index is given. [#6795](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6795)
- [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`](insert.html) now requires only the `INSERT` permission instead of both `INSERT` and `UPDATE`. [#6827](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6827)
- Numeric literals in scientific notation are now case-insensitive. [#6864](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6864)
- `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` is now recognized as a synonym for [`TIMESTAMP`](timestamp.html). [#6888](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6888)
- Attempting to access a database that does not exist now returns PostgreSQL error code `3D000` ("invalid catalog name") instead of a generic error. [#6680](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6680)

### Internal Changes

- Most of the `/_status/` HTTP endpoints now use GRPC internally. [#6702](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6702) [#6788](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6788)
- The `cockroach exterminate` command (which did not work) has been removed. [#6780](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6780)
- Garbage collection now retains the first value outside the configured interval, since it was the current value at the start of the interval. [#6778](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6778)


### Doc Updates

- Docs on the [`INSERT`](insert.html) statement are now available. [#308](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/308) 
- Docs on the [`UPSERT`](upsert.html) statement are now available. [#308](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/308)
