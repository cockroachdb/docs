{% include sql/diagrams/show_all.html %}

## Response

The following run-time variables are returned by `SHOW ALL`:

Variable | Description
------|------------
`DATABASE` | The default database for the current session, as set by [`SET DATABASE`](set-database.html) or the client's connection string. This variable can be viewed with [`SHOW DATABASE`](show-database.html) as well.
`DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` | The default transaction isolation level for the current session, as set by `SET DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` or the client's connection string.
`MAX_INDEX_KEYS` | Not usable; exposed only for ORM compatibility.
`SEARCH_PATH` | A list of databases or namespaces that will be searched to resolve unqualified table or function names, as set by `SET SEARCH_PATH`. This variable can be viewed with `SHOW SEARCH_PATH` as well. For more details, see [Name Resolution](sql-name-resolution.html).
`SERVER_VERSION` | The version of PostgreSQL that CockroachDB emulates.
`SESSION_USER` | The user connected for the current session.
`SYNTAX` | The default SQL syntax for the current session, as set by `SET SYNTAX`. This variable can be viewed with `SHOW SYNTAX` as well.
`TIME ZONE` | The default time zone for the current session, as set by [`SET TIME ZONE`](set-time-zone.html). This variable can be viewed with [`SHOW TIME ZONE`](show-time-zone.html) as well.
`TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` | The isolation level of the current transaction, as set by [`SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`](set-transaction.html). When run in the context of a transaction, [`SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`](show-transaction.html) returns this variable as well.<br><br>This will differ from `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` only when `SHOW ALL` is run in the context of a transaction and `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` has been used to set a non-default isolation level for the specific transaction.
`TRANSACTION PRIORITY` | The priority of the current transaction, as set by [`SET TRANSACTION PRIORITY`](set-transaction.html). When run in the context of a transaction, [`SHOW TRANSACTION PRIORITY`](show-transaction.html) returns this variable as well.
