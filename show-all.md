## Response

The following run-time variables are returned by `SHOW ALL`:

Variable | Description
------|------------
`DATABASE` | The default database for the current session, as set by [`SET DATABASE`](set-database.html) or the client's connection string. This variable can be viewed with [`SHOW DATABASE`](show-database.html) as well. 
`DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` | The default transaction isolation level for the current session, as set by `SET DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` or the client's connection string. 
`MAX_INDEX_KEYS` | Not usable; exposed only for ORM compatibility.
`SEARCH_PATH` | A list of databases or name spaces that will be searched to resolve unqualified table or function names. This variable can be changed with `SET SEARCH_PATH`.
`SERVER_VERSION` | The latest version of PostgreSQL that CockroachDB is compatible with.
`SYNTAX` | The default SQL syntax for the current session, as set by `SET SYNTAX`. This variable can be viewed with `SHOW SYNTAX` as well.
`TIME ZONE` | The default time zone for the current session, as set by [`SET TIME ZONE`](set-time-zone.html). This variable can be viewed with [`SHOW TIME ZONE`](show-time-zone.html) as well.
`TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` | The isolation level of the current transaction, as set by [`SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`](set-transaction.html). When run in the context of a transaction, [`SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`](show-transaction.html) returns this variable as well.<br><br>This will differ from `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` only when `SHOW ALL` is run in the context of a transaction and `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` has been used to set a non-default isolation level for the specific transaction.
`TRANSACTION PRIORITY` | The priority of the current transaction, as set by [`SET TRANSACTION PRIORITY`](set-transaction.html). When run in the context of a transaction, [`SHOW TRANSACTION PRIORITY`](show-transaction.html) returns this variable as well.
