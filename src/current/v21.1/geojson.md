GeoJSON is a textual data format for representing spatial information.  It is based on [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://www.json.org).

GeoJSON can be used to represent the following spatial objects, which also have [Well Known Text (WKT)](well-known-text.html) and [Well Known Binary (WKB)](well-known-binary.html) representations:

- Point
- LineString
- Polygon
- MultiPoint
- MultiLineString
- MultiPolygon
- GeometryCollection

GeoJSON introduces the following additional concepts, which are not part of WKT or WKB:

- A "Feature" object that can contain a geometric shape and some additional properties that describe that shape.  This is useful, for example, when drawing maps on the internet in color, such as on [geojson.io](http://geojson.io).  For an example showing how to add color to a GeoJSON feature, [see below](#geojson-features-example).
- Features can additionally be grouped together into a "FeatureCollection".

GeoJSON should only be used for spatial data that uses the [WGS84](spatial-glossary.html) geographic spatial reference system.  For more information, see [SRID 4326](srid-4326.html).

## Example

In the example below, we will convert a shape represented in [Well Known Text](well-known-text.html) to GeoJSON using the `ST_AsGeoJSON` [function](functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions).

Here is the WKT:

~~~
SRID=4326;POLYGON((-87.906471 43.038902, -95.992775 36.153980, -75.704722 36.076944, -87.906471 43.038902), (-87.623177 41.881832, -90.199402 38.627003, -82.446732 38.413651, -87.623177 41.881832))
~~~

Convert it to GeoJSON using the `ST_AsGeoJSON` function:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT ST_AsGeoJSON('SRID=4326;POLYGON((-87.906471 43.038902, -95.992775 36.153980, -75.704722 36.076944, -87.906471 43.038902), (-87.623177 41.881832, -90.199402 38.627003, -82.446732 38.413651, -87.623177 41.881832))');
~~~

This is the JSON output of the above, but formatted:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ json
{
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
        [
            [
                -87.906471,
                43.038902
            ],
            [
                -95.992775,
                36.15398
            ],
            [
                -75.704722,
                36.076944
            ],
            [
                -87.906471,
                43.038902
            ]
        ],
        [
            [
                -87.623177,
                41.881832
            ],
            [
                -90.199402,
                38.627003
            ],
            [
                -82.446732,
                38.413651
            ],
            [
                -87.623177,
                41.881832
            ]
        ]
    ]
}
~~~

The JSON below is modified from the output above: it is grouped into a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` in which each `Feature` has additional styling information (in the `properties` field) that can be used in visualization tools such as [geojson.io](http://geojson.io):
