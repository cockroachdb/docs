title: SRID 4326 - longitude and latitude
summary: The Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID) 4326 represents spatial data using latitude and longitude coordinates on the Earth's surface.
toc: true
---

Every geometric shape has a spatial reference system associated with it, and each such reference system has a Spatial Reference System ID ([SRID](spatial-glossary.html#srid)).  The SRID is used to tell which spatial reference system will be used to interpret each spatial object.

A common SRID in use is 4326, which represents spatial data using longitude and latitude coordinates on the Earth's surface as defined in the [WGS84](spatial-glossary.html#wgs84) standard, which is also used for the [Global Positioning System (GPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System).

Here is an example shape that uses SRID 4326, a line stretching from Milwaukee, WI to Tulsa, OK:

~~~
SRID=4326;LINESTRING( -87.906471 43.038902, -95.992775 36.153980)
~~~

Most users should only have to care about SRIDs in the following situations:

- When creating shapes.  By default, shapes which do not have an SRID associated with them will use an SRID of 0, which means "this shape has no SRID".
- When comparing shapes. If you try to compare two shapes with different SRIDs using a spatial predicate, CockroachDB will signal an error.

## Adding SRIDs to shapes

### Add an SRID with WKT

To add an SRID to a shape you are defining with [Well Known Text](well-known-text.html), prepend the text with `SRID=N;` as shown below:

~~~
SRID=4326;POLYGON((-79.976111 40.374444, -74.621157 40.323294, -76.609383 39.299236, -79.976111 40.374444))
~~~

### Add an SRID with SQL

To add an SRID to a shape in SQL, use the `ST_SetSRID` [function](functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
select ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(1,2), 4326);
~~~

~~~
                      st_setsrid
------------------------------------------------------
  0101000020E6100000000000000000F03F0000000000000040
(1 row)
~~~

### Change a shape's SRID

To convert a shape to use a different SRID while maintaining the same reference location, use the `ST_Transform` function.  In the example below, we transform the reference system for a line from Albany, NY to Saranac Lake, NY from 4326 to use the [StatePlane New York East reference (SRID 3101)](https://epsg.io/102715).  This can be useful (or at least interesting) in some situations, since the StatePlane systems give distances in feet.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
select ST_Transform(ST_GeomFromText('SRID=4326;LINESTRING(-73.756233 42.652580, -74.130833 44.326111)'),3101);
~~~

~~~
                                         st_transform
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  01020000201D0C000002000000487C82CDD54D4D41EC8A5DA9AD726B4181403E98D7B34C417A15F9897C116B41

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
When setting a shape's SRID, you can only use SRIDs that are defined in the [`spatial_ref_sys`](spatial-glossary.html#spatial_ref_sys) table.  For more information, see [Getting SRID information](#getting-srid-information).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Getting SRID information

You can get more detailed information about the SRIDs supported in CockroachDB from the [SQL client](cockroach-sql.html) by querying the [`spatial_ref_sys`](spatial-glossary.html#spatial_ref_sys) table.

To see how many SRIDs are supported, run the following query:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT count(*) FROM spatial_ref_sys;
~~~

~~~
  count
---------
   6139
(1 row)
~~~

To get more information about a specific SRID (in this case 4326), run the following query:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM spatial_ref_sys WHERE srid = 4326;
~~~

~~~
  srid | auth_name | auth_srid |                                                                                                                              srtext                                                                                                                              |              proj4text
-------+-----------+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------

## Comparing shapes with different SRIDs

If you try to compare two shapes with different SRIDs using a spatial predicate, CockroachDB will signal an error:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
select ST_Contains(ST_MakePoint(1,2), ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(1,2), 4326));
~~~

~~~
ERROR: st_contains(): operation on mixed SRIDs forbidden: (Point, 0) != (Point, 4326)
~~~

## Known limitations

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Defining a custom SRID by inserting rows into [`spatial_ref_sys`](spatial-glossary.html#spatial_ref_sys) is not currently supported.  For more information, please see the tracking issue [cockroachdb/cockroach#55903](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/55903).
