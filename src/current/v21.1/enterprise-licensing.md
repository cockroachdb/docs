CockroachDB distributes a single binary that contains both core and Enterprise features. You can use core features without any license key. However, to use the Enterprise features, you need either a trial or an Enterprise license key.

This page lists Enterprise features. For information on how to obtain and set trial and Enterprise license keys for CockroachDB, see the [Licensing FAQs](licensing-faqs.html#obtain-a-license).
