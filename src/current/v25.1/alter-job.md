{% include_cached new-in.html version="v25.1" %} The `ALTER JOB` statement transfers ownership of a [job]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-jobs.md %}) between [users]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-user.md %}) or [roles]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-role.md %}).

## Required privileges

To alter job ownership, the user must be one of the following: 

- The current job owner.
- A member of the role that is the current owner. 
- An `admin`.

Unless the user is an `admin`, they can only transfer ownership of a job to themselves or to a role of which they are a member.

To add a user to a role, refer to the [`GRANT`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/grant.md %}) statement.
