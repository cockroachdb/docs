Core and {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds offer different levels of configurability. {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds allow for active changefeed jobs to be [paused](#pause), [resumed](#resume), and [canceled](#cancel).

This page describes:

- [Guidelines](#before-you-create-a-changefeed) to consider before creating a changefeed.
- [Reference examples](#configure-a-changefeed) for creating and managing a changefeed.

## Before you create a changefeed

1. Enable rangefeeds on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }}. Refer to [Enable rangefeeds](#enable-rangefeeds) for instructions.
1. Decide on whether you will run an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} or basic changefeed. Refer to the [Overview]({{ page.version.version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md) page for a comparative capability table.
1. Consider whether your {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} [changefeed use case](#create) would be better served by [change data capture queries]({{ page.version.version }}/cdc-queries.md) that can filter data on a single table. CDC queries can improve the efficiency of changefeeds because the job will not need to encode as much change data.
1. Read the following: 
    - The [Changefeed Best Practices]({{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-best-practices.md) reference for details on planning changefeeds, monitoring basics, and schema changes. 
    - The [Considerations](#considerations) section that provides information on changefeed interactions that could affect how you configure or run your changefeed.

### Enable rangefeeds

Changefeeds connect to a long-lived request called a _rangefeed_, which pushes changes as they happen. This reduces the latency of row changes, as well as reduces transaction restarts on tables being watched by a changefeed for some workloads.

**Rangefeeds must be enabled for a changefeed to work.** To [enable the cluster setting]({{ page.version.version }}/set-cluster-setting.md):

~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.rangefeed.enabled = true;
~~~

Any created changefeeds will error until this setting is enabled. If you are working on a CockroachDB Serverless cluster, the `kv.rangefeed.enabled` cluster setting is enabled by default.

Enabling rangefeeds has a small performance cost (about a 5â€“10% increase in write latencies), whether or not the rangefeed is being used in a changefeed. When `kv.rangefeed.enabled` is set to `true`, a small portion of the latency cost is caused by additional write event information that is sent to the [Raft log]({{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md#raft-logs) and for [replication]({{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md). The remainder of the latency cost is incurred once a changefeed is running; the write event information is reconstructed and sent to an active rangefeed, which will push the event to the changefeed.

For further detail on performance-related configuration, refer to the [Advanced Changefeed Confguration]({{ page.version.version }}/advanced-changefeed-configuration.md) page.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
[`MuxRangefeed`]({{ page.version.version }}/advanced-changefeed-configuration.md#mux-rangefeeds) is a subsystem that improves the performance of rangefeeds with scale, which is enabled by default in v24.1 and later versions.

### Considerations

- If you require [`resolved`]({{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md#resolved) message frequency under `30s`, then you **must** set the [`min_checkpoint_frequency`]({{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md#min-checkpoint-frequency) option to at least the desired `resolved` frequency.
- Many DDL queries (including [`TRUNCATE`]({{ page.version.version }}/truncate.md), [`DROP TABLE`]({{ page.version.version }}/drop-table.md), and queries that add a column family) will cause errors on a changefeed watching the affected tables. You will need to [start a new changefeed]({{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md#start-a-new-changefeed-where-another-ended). If a table is truncated that a changefeed with `on_error='pause'` is watching, you will also need to start a new changefeed. Refer to the change data capture [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for more detail.
- Partial or intermittent sink unavailability may impact changefeed stability. If a sink is unavailable, messages can't send, which means that a changefeed's high-water mark timestamp is at risk of falling behind the cluster's [garbage collection window]({{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md#replication-zone-variables). Throughput and latency can be affected once the sink is available again. However, [ordering guarantees]({{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-messages.md#ordering-and-delivery-guarantees) will still hold for as long as a changefeed [remains active]({{ page.version.version }}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md#monitor-a-changefeed).
- When an [`IMPORT INTO`]({{ page.version.version }}/import-into.md) statement is run, any current changefeed jobs targeting that table will fail.
- After you [restore from a full-cluster backup]({{ page.version.version }}/restore.md#full-cluster), changefeed jobs will **not** resume on the new cluster. It is necessary to manually create the changefeeds following the full-cluster restore.

The following Enterprise and Core sections outline how to create and configure each type of changefeed:

## Configure a changefeed

An {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed streams row-level changes in a [configurable format]({{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-messages.md) to one of the following sinks:


You can [create](#create), [pause](#pause), [resume](#resume), and [cancel](#cancel) an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed. For a step-by-step example connecting to a specific sink, see the [Changefeed Examples]({{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-examples.md) page.

### Create

To create an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

~~~ sql
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE table_name, table_name2 INTO '{scheme}://{host}:{port}?{query_parameters}';
~~~


When you create a changefeed **without** specifying a sink, CockroachDB sends the changefeed events to the SQL client. Consider the following regarding the [display format]({{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md#sql-flag-format) in your SQL client:

- If you do not define a display format, the CockroachDB SQL client will automatically use `ndjson` format.
- If you specify a display format, the client will use that format (e.g., `--format=csv`).
- If you set the client display format to `ndjson` and set the changefeed [`format`]({{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md#format) to `csv`, you'll receive JSON format with CSV nested inside.
- If you set the client display format to `csv` and set the changefeed [`format`]({{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md#format) to `json`, you'll receive a comma-separated list of JSON values.

For more information, see [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`]({{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md).

### Show

To pause an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

~~~ sql
PAUSE JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, refer to [`PAUSE JOB`]({{ page.version.version }}/pause-job.md).

### Resume

~~~ sql
RESUME JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, refer to [`RESUME JOB`]({{ page.version.version }}/resume-job.md).

## Create a changefeed

A basic changefeed streams row-level changes to the client indefinitely until the underlying connection is closed or the changefeed is canceled.

To create a basic changefeed:

~~~ sql
EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR table_name;
~~~

For more information, see [`EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR`]({{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-for.md).
