This page shows you how to manually deploy an insecure multi-node CockroachDB cluster on Microsoft Azure, using Azure's managed load balancing service to distribute client traffic.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}If you plan to use CockroachDB in production, we strongly recommend using a secure cluster instead. Select <strong>Secure</strong> above for instructions.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Before you begin

### Requirements

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-requirements.md %}

### Recommendations

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-recommendations.md %}

## Step 1. Configure your network

CockroachDB requires TCP communication on two ports:

- **26257** (`tcp:26257`) for inter-node communication (i.e., working as a cluster), for applications to connect to the load balancer, and for routing from the load balancer to nodes
- **8080** (`tcp:8080`) for exposing your Admin UI

To enable this in Azure, you must create a Resource Group, Virtual Network, and Network Security Group.

1. [Create a Resource Group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/create-empty-resource-groups/).

2. [Create a Virtual Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal) that uses your **Resource Group**.

3. [Create a Network Security Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-pportal) that uses your **Resource Group**, and then add the following **inbound** rules to it:
    - **Admin UI support**:

         Field | Recommended Value
        -------|-------------------
         Name | **cockroachadmin**
         Source | **IP Addresses**
         Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges | Your local network’s IP ranges
         Source port ranges | *
         Destination | **Any**
         Destination port range | **8080**
         Protocol | **TCP**
         Action | **Allow**
         Priority | Any value > 1000
    - **Application support**:

        {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}If your application is also hosted on the same Azure     Virtual Network, you will not need to create a firewall rule for your application to communicate     with your load balancer.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

         Field | Recommended Value
        -------|-------------------
         Name | **cockroachapp**
         Source | **IP Addresses**
         Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges | Your local network’s IP ranges
         Source port ranges | *
         Destination | **Any**
         Destination port range | **26257**
         Protocol | **TCP**
         Action | **Allow**
         Priority | Any value > 1000


## Step 2. Create VMs

[Create Linux VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/quick-create-portal) for each node you plan to have in your cluster. If you plan to run a sample workload against the cluster, create a separate VM for that workload.

- Run at least 3 nodes to [ensure survivability](recommended-production-settings.html#topology).

- Use compute-optimized [F-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/fsv2-series) VMs with [Premium Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage) or local SSD storage with a Linux filesystem such as `ext4` (not the Windows `ntfs` filesystem). For example, Cockroach Labs has used `Standard_F16s_v2` VMs (16 vCPUs and 32 GiB of RAM per VM) for internal testing.

    - If you choose local SSD storage, on reboot, the VM can come back with the `ntfs` filesystem. Be sure your automation monitors for this and reformats the disk to the Linux filesystem you chose initially.

- **Do not** use ["burstable" B-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/b-series-burstable) VMs, which limit the load on a single core. Also, Cockroach Labs has experienced data corruption issues on A-series VMs and irregular disk performance on D-series VMs, so we recommend avoiding those as well.

- When creating the VMs, make sure to select the **Resource Group**, **Virtual Network**, and **Network Security Group** you created.

For more details, see [Hardware Recommendations](recommended-production-settings.html#hardware) and [Cluster Topology](recommended-production-settings.html#topology).

## Step 3. Synchronize clocks

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/synchronize-clocks.md %}

## Step 4. Set up load balancing

Each CockroachDB node is an equally suitable SQL gateway to your cluster, but to ensure client performance and reliability, it's important to use load balancing:

- **Performance:** Load balancers spread client traffic across nodes. This prevents any one node from being overwhelmed by requests and improves overall cluster performance (queries per second).

- **Reliability:** Load balancers decouple client health from the health of a single CockroachDB node. In cases where a node fails, the load balancer redirects client traffic to available nodes.

Microsoft Azure offers fully-managed load balancing to distribute traffic between instances.

1. [Add Azure load balancing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview). Be sure to:
	- Set forwarding rules to route TCP traffic from the load balancer's port **26257** to port **26257** on the nodes.
	- Configure health checks to use HTTP port **8080** and path `/health?ready=1`. This [health endpoint](monitoring-and-alerting.html#health-ready-1) ensures that load balancers do not direct traffic to nodes that are live but not ready to receive requests.

2. Note the provisioned **IP Address** for the load balancer. You'll use this later to test load balancing and to connect your application to the cluster.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}If you would prefer to use HAProxy instead of Azure's managed load balancing, see the <a href="deploy-cockroachdb-on-premises-insecure.html">On-Premises</a> tutorial for guidance.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 5. Start nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-start-nodes.md %}

## Step 6. Initialize the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-initialize-cluster.md %}

## Step 7. Test the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-test-cluster.md %}

## Step 8. Run a sample workload

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-test-load-balancing.md %}

## Step 9. Monitor the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/monitor-cluster.md %}

## Step 10. Scale the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-scale-cluster.md %}

## Step 11. Use the cluster

Now that your deployment is working, you can:

1. [Implement your data model](sql-statements.html).
2. [Create users](create-user.html) and [grant them privileges](grant.html).
3. [Connect your application](install-client-drivers.html). Be sure to connect your application to the Azure load balancer, not to a CockroachDB node.
