# CrdbTenant-specific metrics. The metrics in this list will be combined with
# the ones in shared_metrics.yaml.
#
# Each metric is mapped to an aggregation function that indicates how the metric
# should be aggregated when needed
#
# Note: The aggregation functions here are declared as noop because they are
# only applied for UA-enabled clusters. For regular tenant clusters, these
# values are not used but are included for consistency with the overall data
# structure.
