# metrics.yml is a manually curated file of metrics that are included in the Canned Metrics for Serverless deployment.
# The metrics are in the order of appearance in the configuration file:
# https://github.com/cockroachlabs/managed-service/pull/16129/files
# console/assets/js/pages/clusterDetail/metrics/graphConfigs.tsx
# The data for the metrics was also sourced from
# https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/blob/main/src/current/_includes/v23.2/essential-metrics.md
# 
# The corresponding metrics-list.csv file was generated using the v23.2.0 binary with the following command:
# cockroach gen metric-list --format=csv > metrics-list.csv
# Once generated, the metrics-list.csv was manually modified to change the case of the headers to lowercase to work with liquid comparison code.
