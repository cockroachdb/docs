Note that a ""batch"" in this context is really a sub-batch of the batch received

- entry application (incl. replicated side effects, notably log truncation)

These include work measured in 'raft.process.commandcommit.latency' and
'raft.process.applycommitted.latency'. However, matching percentiles of these
metrics may be *higher* than handleready, since not every handleready cycle
leads to an update of the others. For example, under tpcc-100 on a single node,
the handleready count is approximately twice the logcommit count (and logcommit
count tracks closely with applycommitted count).

High percentile outliers can be caused by individual large Raft commands or
storage layer blips. Lower percentile (e.g. 50th) increases are often driven by
CPU exhaustion or storage layer slowdowns.

These are the bytes returned from the (raft.Storage).Entries method that were not

Since pebble might serve these entries from the block cache, only a fraction of this
throughput might manifest in disk metrics.

Entries tracked in this metric incur an unmarshalling-related CPU and memory
overhead that would not be incurred would the entries be served from the raft
entry cache.

The bytes returned here do not correspond 1:1 to bytes read from pebble. This
metric measures the in-memory size of the raftpb.Entry, whereas we read its
encoded representation from pebble. As there is no compression involved, these
will generally be comparable.

A common reason for elevated measurements on this metric is that a store is
falling behind on raft log application. The raft entry cache generally tracks
entries that were recently appended, so if log application falls behind the
cache will already have moved on to newer entries.
