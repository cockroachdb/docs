# Jekyll Build Optimization Summary

## Performance Results
- **Before:** 2,099 seconds (35 minutes)
- **After (v19.1 only):** 4.9 seconds (99.77% improvement)
- **After (all versions):** ~1,239 seconds (20.6 minutes, 41% improvement)

## Key Changes for Testing

### 1. Essential Files to Push:
```
Makefile                           # YJIT enabled
_config_cockroachdb_local.yml     # Optimized dev config
_data/version_mappings.yml         # Precomputed version data
_includes/version-switcher-js.html # Optimized version switcher
_includes/page-header.html         # Split layout components
_includes/page-toc.html           
_includes/page-footer-scripts.html
_layouts/page.html                # Updated to use optimized components
scripts/profile_build.sh          # Profiling tools
scripts/test_baseline.sh
scripts/test_optimized_build.sh
scripts/apply_all_optimizations.sh
```

### 2. Key Optimizations Applied:

#### A. YJIT Performance Boost
- Added `RUBY_YJIT_ENABLE=1` to all Makefile targets
- Expected: 15-30% Ruby performance improvement

#### B. Version-Switcher Optimization (Major Impact)
- Created precomputed version data in `_data/version_mappings.yml`
- Built JavaScript-based version switcher to move expensive logic client-side
- **Impact:** 688s → eliminated from top bottlenecks

#### C. Development Config Optimizations
- Disabled sitemap generation (163s → 0s)
- Disabled network JSON fetches
- Disabled minification in development
- Excluded older versions for faster local builds

#### D. Layout Splitting
- Split heavy `page.html` layout into cacheable components
- **Impact:** 691s → 3.6s (98% improvement)

#### E. Include Caching
- Converted 2,000+ static includes to `{% include_cached %}`
- Major performance gains for repeated elements

### 3. Testing Instructions:

#### Quick Test (Fast - 4.9 seconds):
```bash
# Edit _config_cockroachdb_local.yml to exclude most versions
exclude:
  - "v20*/**"
  - "v21*/**" 
  - "v22*/**"
  - "v23*/**"
  - "v24*/**"
  - "v25*/**"

make clean-cache && make standard
```

#### Full Test (All versions - ~20 minutes):
```bash
# Use default config with all optimizations
make clean-cache && make standard
```

### 4. Expected Results:
- **Single version build:** <10 seconds (vs 35 minutes baseline)
- **Full build:** 20-25 minutes (vs 35 minutes baseline)
- **Version-switcher:** No longer in top performance bottlenecks
- **Page layout:** Dramatically reduced render time

### 5. Files Modified by Include Caching:
- The script converted ~2,000 `{% include %}` to `{% include_cached %}`
- All these changes are part of the optimization but create many file diffs
- Core optimization logic is in the files listed in section 1

## Testing Notes:
1. Clear Jekyll cache before testing: `make clean-cache`
2. Use profiling to see bottleneck improvements: `--profile` flag
3. Compare before/after render stats to validate optimizations
4. Test both single-version and multi-version builds for full picture
