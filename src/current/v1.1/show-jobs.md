toc: true

<span class="version-tag">New in v1.1:</span> The `SHOW JOBS` [statement](sql-statements.html) lists all of the types of long-running tasks your cluster has performed, including:

- Schema changes through `ALTER TABLE`
- Enterprise [`BACKUP`](backup.html), [`RESTORE`](restore.html), and [`IMPORT`](import.html)

These details can help you understand the status of crucial tasks that can impact the performance of your cluster, as well as help you control them.


## Required Privileges

By default, only the `root` user can execute `SHOW JOBS`.

## Synopsis

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/diagrams/show_jobs.html %}

## Response

The following fields are returned for each job:

Field | Description
------|------------
`id` | A unique ID to identify each job. This value is used if you want to control jobs (i.e., [pause](pause-job.html), [resume](resume-job.html), or [cancel](cancel-job.html) it).
`type` | The type of job. Possible values: `SCHEMA CHANGE`, [`BACKUP`](backup.html), [`RESTORE`](restore.html), or [`IMPORT`](import.html).
`description` | The command that started the job.
`username` | The user who started the job.
`status` | The job's current state. Possible values: `pending`, `running`, `paused`, `failed`, `succeeded`, or `canceled`.
`created` | The `TIMESTAMP` when the job was created.
`started` | The `TIMESTAMP` when the job began running first.
`finished` | The `TIMESTAMP` when the job was `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`.
`modified` | The `TIMESTAMP` when the job had anything modified.
`fraction_completed` | The fraction (between `0.00` and `1.00`) of the job that's been completed.
`error` | If the job `failed`, the error generated by the failure.

### Filter Jobs

You can filter jobs by using `SHOW JOBS` as the data source for a [`SELECT`](select.html) statement, and then filtering the values with the `WHERE` clause.

~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM [SHOW JOBS] WHERE type = 'RESTORE' AND status IN ('running', 'failed') ORDER BY created DESC;
~~~
~~~
+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
|       id       |  type   |               description                 |...
+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
