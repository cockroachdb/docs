Despite CockroachDB's various [built-in safeguards against failure](high-availability.html), it is critical to actively monitor the overall health and performance of a cluster running in production and to create alerting rules that promptly send notifications when there are events that require investigation or intervention.

This page explains available monitoring tools and critical events and metrics to alert on.


## Monitoring Tools

### Admin UI

The [built-in Admin UI](admin-ui-overview.html) gives you essential metrics about a cluster's health, such as the number of live, dead, and suspect nodes, the number of unavailable ranges, and the queries per second and service latency across the cluster. It is accessible from every node at `http://<host>:<http-port>`, or `http://<host>:8080` by default.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}Because the Admin UI is built into CockroachDB, if a cluster becomes unavailable, most of the Admin UI becomes unavailable as well. Therefore, it's essential to plan additional methods of monitoring cluster health as described below.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Prometheus Endpoint

Every node of a CockroachDB cluster exports granular timeseries metrics at `http://<host>:<http-port>/_status/vars`. The metrics are formatted for easy integration with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), an open source tool for storing, aggregating, and querying timeseries data, but the format is **easy-to-parse** and can be massaged to work with other third-party monitoring systems (e.g., [Sysdig](https://sysdig.atlassian.net/wiki/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=64946336#content/view/64946336) and [Stackdriver](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-stackdriver/tree/master/prometheus-to-sd)).

For a tutorial on using Prometheus, see [Monitor CockroachDB with Prometheus](monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.html).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}In addition to using the exported timeseries data to monitor a cluster via an external system, you can write alerting rules against them to make sure you are promptly notified of critical events or issues that may require intervention or investigation. See <a href="#events-to-alert-on">Events to Alert On</a> for more details.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Health Endpoints

CockroachDB provides two HTTP endpoints for checking the health of individual nodes.

#### /health

If a node is down, the `http://<host>:<http-port>/health` endpoint returns a `Connnection refused` error:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/health
~~~

~~~
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
~~~

Otherwise, it returns an HTTP `200 OK` status response code with details about the node:

~~~
{
  "nodeId": 1,
  "address": {
    "networkField": "tcp",
    "addressField": "JESSEs-MBP:26257"
  },
  "buildInfo": {
    "goVersion": "go1.9",
    "tag": "v2.0-alpha.20180212-629-gf1271b232-dirty",
    "time": "2018/02/21 04:09:53",
    "revision": "f1271b2322a4a1060461707bdccd77b6d5a1843e",
    "cgoCompiler": "4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)",
    "platform": "darwin amd64",
    "distribution": "CCL",
    "type": "development",
    "dependencies": null
  }
}
~~~

#### /&#95;admin/v1/health

If a node is unable to communicate with a majority of the other nodes in the cluster, likely because the cluster is unavailable due to too many nodes being down, the `http://<node-host>:<http-port>/_admin/v1/health` endpoint returns an HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` status response code with an error:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/_admin/v1/health
~~~

~~~
{
  "error": "node is not healthy",
  "code": 14
}
~~~

Otherwise, it returns an HTTP `200 OK` status response code with an empty body:

~~~
{

}
~~~

### Raw Status Endpoints

Several endpoints return raw status metrics in JSON at `http://<host>:<http-port>/#/debug`. Feel free to investigate and use these endpoints, but note that they are subject to change.

### Node Status Command

The [`cockroach node status`](view-node-details.html) command gives you metrics about the health and status of each node.

- With the `--ranges` flag, you get granular range and replica details, including unavailability and under-replication.
- With the `--stats` flag, you get granular disk usage details.
- With the `--decommission` flag, you get details about the [node decommissioning](remove-nodes.html) process.
- With the `--all` flag, you get all of the above.

## Events to Alert On

Active monitoring helps you spot problems early, but it is also essential to create alerting rules that promptly send notifications when there are events that require investigation or intervention. This section identifies the most important events to create alerting rules for, with the [Prometheus Endpoint](#prometheus-endpoint) metrics to use for detecting the events.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}If you use Prometheus for monitoring, you can also use our pre-defined <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/monitoring/rules/alerts.rules.yml">alerting rules</a> with Alertmanager. See <a href="monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.html">Monitor CockroachDB with Prometheus</a> for guidance.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Node is down

- **Rule:** Send an alert when a node has been down for 5 minutes or more.

- **How to detect:** If a node is down, its `_status/vars` endpoint will return a `Connection refused` error. Otherwise, the `liveness_livenodes` metric will be the total number of live nodes in the cluster.

### Node is restarting too frequently

- **Rule:** Send an alert if a node has restarted more than 5 times in 10 minutes.

- **How to detect:** Calculate this using the number of times the `sys_uptime` metric in the node's `_status/vars` output was reset back to zero. The `sys_uptime` metric gives you the length of time, in seconds, that the `cockroach` process has been running.

### Node is running low on disk space

- **Rule:** Send an alert when a node has less than 15% of free space remaining.

- **How to detect:** Divide the `capacity` metric by the `capacity_available` metric in the node's `_status/vars` output.

### Node is not executing SQL

- **Rule:** Send an alert when a node is not executing SQL despite having connections.

- **How to detect:** The `sql_conns` metric in the node's `_status/vars` output will be greater than `0` while the `sql_query_count` metric will be `0`. You can also break this down by statement type using `sql_select_count`, `sql_insert_count`, `sql_update_count`, and `sql_delete_count`.

### CA certificate expires soon

- **Rule:** Send an alert when the CA certificate on a node will expire in less than a year.

- **How to detect:** Calculate this using the `security_certificate_expiration_ca` metric in the node's `_status/vars` output.

### Node certificate expires soon

- **Rule:** Send an alert when a node's certificate will expire in less than a year.

- **How to detect:** Calculate this using the `security_certificate_expiration_node` metric in the node's `_status/vars` output.
