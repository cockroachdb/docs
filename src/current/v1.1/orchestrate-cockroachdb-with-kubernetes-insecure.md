This page shows you how to orchestrate the deployment and management of an insecure 3-node CockroachDB cluster with [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), using the [StatefulSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) feature.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}If you plan to use CockroachDB in production, we strongly recommend using a secure cluster instead. Select <strong>Secure</strong> above for instructions.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Before You Begin

Before getting started, it's helpful to review some Kubernetes-specific terminology and current limitations.

### Kubernetes Terminology

Feature | Description
--------|------------
instance | A physical or virtual machine. In this tutorial, you'll create GCE or AWS instances and join them into a single Kubernetes cluster from your local workstation.
[pod](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/) | A pod is a group of one of more Docker containers. In this tutorial, each pod will run on a separate instance and include one Docker container running a single CockroachDB node. You'll start with 3 pods and grow to 4.
[StatefulSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) | A StatefulSet is a group of pods treated as stateful units, where each pod has distinguishable network identity and always binds back to the same persistent storage on restart. StatefulSets are considered stable as of Kubernetes version 1.9 after reaching beta in version 1.5.
[persistent volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) | A persistent volume is a piece of networked storage (Persistent Disk on GCE, Elastic Block Store on AWS) mounted into a pod. The lifetime of a persistent volume is decoupled from the lifetime of the pod that's using it, ensuring that each CockroachDB node binds back to the same storage on restart.<br><br>This tutorial assumes that dynamic volume provisioning is available. When that is not the case, [persistent volume claims](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) need to be created manually.

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/start-kubernetes.md %}

## Step 3. Start CockroachDB nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/start-cluster.md %}

## Step 4. Initialize the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/initialize-cluster-insecure.md %}

## Step 5. Test the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/test-cluster-insecure.md %}

## Step 6. Monitor the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/monitor-cluster.md %}

## Step 7. Simulate node failure

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-simulate-failure.md %}

## Step 8. Scale the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-scale-cluster.md %}

3. Verify that a fourth pod was added successfully:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl get pods
    ~~~

    ~~~
    NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cockroachdb-0   1/1       Running   0          2h
    cockroachdb-1   1/1       Running   0          2h
    cockroachdb-2   1/1       Running   0          9m
    cockroachdb-3   1/1       Running   0          46s
    ~~~

## Step 9. Upgrade the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-upgrade-cluster.md %}

4. If this was an upgrade between minor or major versions (e.g., between v1.0.x and v1.1.y or between v1.1.y and v2.0.z), then you'll want to [finalize the upgrade](upgrade-cockroach-version.html#finalize-the-upgrade) if you're happy with the new version. Assuming you upgraded to the v1.1 minor version, you'd run:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-0 -- ./cockroach sql --insecure -e "SET CLUSTER SETTING version = '1.1';"
    ~~~

    ~~~
    SET CLUSTER SETTING
    ~~~

## Step 10. Stop the cluster

To shut down the CockroachDB cluster:

1. Delete all of the resources you created, including the logs and remote persistent volumes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl delete pods,statefulsets,services,persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes,poddisruptionbudget,jobs \
    -l app=cockroachdb
    ~~~

    ~~~
    pod "cockroachdb-0" deleted
    pod "cockroachdb-1" deleted
    pod "cockroachdb-2" deleted
    pod "cockroachdb-3" deleted
    statefulset "cockroachdb" deleted
    service "cockroachdb" deleted
    service "cockroachdb-public" deleted
    persistentvolumeclaim "datadir-cockroachdb-0" deleted
    persistentvolumeclaim "datadir-cockroachdb-1" deleted
    persistentvolumeclaim "datadir-cockroachdb-2" deleted
    persistentvolumeclaim "datadir-cockroachdb-3" deleted
    poddisruptionbudget "cockroachdb-budget" deleted
    ~~~

2. Stop Kubernetes:
