This tutorial shows you how to manually deploy an insecure multi-node CockroachDB cluster on multiple machines, using [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) load balancers to distribute client traffic.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}If you plan to use CockroachDB in production, we strongly recommend using a secure cluster instead. Select <strong>Secure</strong> above for instructions.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Recommendations

## Step 1. Synchronize clocks

## Step 2. Start nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-start-nodes.md %}

## Step 3. Initialize the cluster

## Step 4. Test the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/insecure-test-cluster.md %}

## Step 5. Set up HAProxy load balancers

Each CockroachDB node is an equally suitable SQL gateway to your cluster, but to ensure client performance and reliability, it's important to use load balancing:

- **Performance:** Load balancers spread client traffic across nodes. This prevents any one node from being overwhelmed by requests and improves overall cluster performance (queries per second).

- **Reliability:** Load balancers decouple client health from the health of a single CockroachDB node. In cases where a node fails, the load balancer redirects client traffic to available nodes.
  {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}With a single load balancer, client connections are resilient to node failure, but the load balancer itself is a point of failure. It's therefore best to make load balancing resilient as well by using multiple load balancing instances, with a mechanism like floating IPs or DNS to select load balancers for clients.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

[HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) is one of the most popular open-source TCP load balancers, and CockroachDB includes a built-in command for generating a configuration file that is preset to work with your running cluster, so we feature that tool here.

1. SSH to the machine where you want to run HAProxy.

2. Install HAProxy:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ shell
	$ apt-get install haproxy
	~~~

3. Download the [CockroachDB archive](https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz) for Linux, and extract the binary:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz \
    | tar -xz
    ~~~

4. Copy the binary into the `PATH`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cp -i cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/
    ~~~

	If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with `sudo`.

5. Run the [`cockroach gen haproxy`](generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) command, specifying the address of any CockroachDB node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
	  ~~~ shell
	  $ cockroach gen haproxy --insecure \
	  --host=<address of any node> \
	  --port=26257 \
	  ~~~

	  By default, the generated configuration file is called `haproxy.cfg` and looks as follows, with the `server` addresses pre-populated correctly:

	  ~~~
    global
      maxconn 4096

    defaults
        mode                tcp
        # Timeout values should be configured for your specific use.
        # See: https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html#4-timeout%20connect
        timeout connect     10s
        timeout client      1m
        timeout server      1m
        # TCP keep-alive on client side. Server already enables them.
        option              clitcpka

    listen psql
        bind :26257
        mode tcp
        balance roundrobin
        server cockroach1 <node1 address>:26257 check
        server cockroach2 <node2 address>:26258 check
        server cockroach3 <node3 address>:26259 check
    ~~~

	  The file is preset with the minimal [configurations](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.7/configuration.html) needed to work with your running cluster:

  	Field | Description
  	------|------------
  	`timout connect`<br>`timeout client`<br>`timeout server` | Timeout values that should be suitable for most deployments.
  	`bind` | The port that HAProxy listens on. This is the port clients will connect to and thus needs to be allowed by your network configuration.<br><br>This tutorial assumes HAProxy is running on a separate machine from CockroachDB nodes. If you run HAProxy on the same machine as a node (not recommended), you'll need to change this port, as `26257` is also used for inter-node communication.
  	`balance` | The balancing algorithm. This is set to `roundrobin` to ensure that connections get rotated amongst nodes (connection 1 on node 1, connection 2 on node 2, etc.). Check the [HAProxy Configuration Manual](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.7/configuration.html#4-balance) for details about this and other balancing algorithms.
  	`server` | For each node in the cluster, this field specifies the interface that the node listens on, i.e., the address passed in the `--host` flag on node startup. `check` specifies that HAProxy will confirm that a connection can be established before sending data to a node.

  	{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}For full details on these and other configuration settings, see the <a href="http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.7/configuration.html">HAProxy Configuration Manual</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

6. Start HAProxy, with the `-f` flag pointing to the `haproxy.cfg` file:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ shell
	$ haproxy -f haproxy.cfg
	~~~

7. Repeat these steps for each additional instance of HAProxy you want to run.

## Step 6. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Step 7. Scale the cluster

## Step 8. Use the cluster
