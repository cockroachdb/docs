[Splits](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ include.version }}/architecture/distribution-layer#range-splits) no longer hold [latches](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/architecture/distribution-layer.#latch-manager) for time proportional to the range size while computing [MVCC](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ include.version }}/architecture/storage-layer#mvcc) statistics. Instead, MVCC statistics are pre-computed before the critical section of the split. As a side effect, the resulting statistics are no longer 100% accurate because they may correctly distribute writes concurrent with the split. To mitigate against this potential inaccuracy, and to prevent the statistics from drifting after successive splits, the existing stored statistics are re-computed and corrected if needed during the non-critical section of the split.
