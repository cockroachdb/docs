For example, if you have a backup schedule running backups for the database `users` the full backup and incremental backup should have the same storage URI for the full and incremental schedule. (`CREATE SCHEDULE FOR BACKUP` will automatically create two schedules for the full and incremental backup to the same storage URI.) If there is another backup schedule, for the database `accounts`, the full and incremental backups for `accounts` should have the same storage URI. However, the storage URI for the `accounts` backup collection should be different to the storage URI for the `users` backup collection.
