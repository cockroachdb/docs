<h3 id="v20-1-3-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- HTTP endpoints beginning with `/debug/` now require a valid [`admin`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/authorization) login session. [#50487][#50487]

<h3 id="v20-1-3-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- [Full cluster restore](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/restore#full-cluster) is now more resilient to transient transaction retry errors during restore. [#50004][#50004]
- The default flush interval for [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/change-data-capture) that do not specify a `RESOLVED` option is now 5s instead of 200ms to more gracefully handle higher-latency sinks. [#50251][#50251]

<h3 id="v20-1-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Previously, using `infinity` evaluated to a negative, i.e., "-292277022365-05-08T08:17:07Z". This has been fixed to be the maximum supported timestamp in PostgreSQL that is not infinity. Likewise, `-infinity` is the smallest supported value. Note this does currently does not behave exactly like `infinity` in PostgreSQL (this is a work in progress and may be resolved later). [#50365][#50365]

<h3 id="v20-1-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, `extract(epoch from timestamptz)` from a session time zone not in UTC would return a value which was incorrectly offset by the session time zone. This is now fixed. [#50075][#50075]
- Previously, the parallel importer could get stuck due to a race between emitted import batches and checking for context cancellation (either due to an unforeseen error, or due to explicit context cancallation). This is now fixed. [#50089][#50089]
- Previously, using separate groups for producer and consumer could lead to a situation where consumer would exit (due to an error, or explicit context cancellation) without the producer realizing, leading to a deadlock. Producer and consumer are now correctly linked during data import. [#50089][#50089]
- Casting to width-limited strings now works correctly for strings containing Unicode characters. [#50159][#50159]
- Fixed some cases in which casting a string to a width-limited string array was not truncating the string. [#50168][#50168]
- Fixed a bug in which restarting CockroachDB with the Pebble storage engine after a crash during write-ahead logging could, in some rare cases, return an "unexpected EOF" error. [#50282][#50282]
- Previously, the [Admin UI Statements page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/admin-ui-statements-page) was incorrectly displaying information about whether or not a statement was distributed (it was always `Yes`). This is now fixed. [#50347][#50347]
- Fixed a RocksDB bug that could result in inconsistencies in rare circumstances. [#50397][#50397]
- Fixed a bug that broke the data distribution [Advanced Debug page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/admin-ui-debug-pages) in the Admin UI on clusters that had upgraded from 19.2 to 20.1. [#49987][#49987]
- Previously, when a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/change-data-capture) would fail to set up its flows due to a node draining, the changefeed would be marked as failed. These errors are now retryable. [#50088][#50088]

<h3 id="v20-1-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- CockroachDB now optimizes reading of files when doing backups and storage-level compactions of files. This should deliver a performance improvement for some read-heavy operations on an IOPS-constrained device. [#50105][#50105]
- Limited [`SELECT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/select-clause) statements now do a better job avoiding unnecessary contention with [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/update) and [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/select-for-update) statements. [#50119][#50119]
- Improved the [optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/cost-based-optimizer)'s estimation of the selectivity of some filters involving a disjunction (`OR`) of predicates over multiple columns. This results in more accurate cardinality estimation and enables the optimizer to choose better query plans in some cases. [#50470][#50470]

<h3 id="v20-1-3-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Release Docker images are now built on Debian 9.12. [#50482][#50482]

<h3 id="v20-1-3-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- Updated guidance on [node decommissioning](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/remove-nodes). [#7304][#7304]
- Added node density guidance to the [Production Checklist](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/recommended-production-settings#node-density-testing-configuration). [#7514][#7514]
- Renamed "whitelist/blacklist" terminology to "allowlist/blocklist". [#7535][#7535]
- Updated the Releases navigation in the sidebar to expose the latest Production and Testing releases. [#7550][#7550]
- Fixed scrollbar visibility on Chrome. [#7487][#7487]
