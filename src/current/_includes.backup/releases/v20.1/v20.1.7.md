<h3 id="v20-1-7-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Fixed a case where connections to Google Cloud storage would ignore the [`--external-io-disable-implicit-credentials`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/cockroach-start#external-io-disable-implicit-credentials) flag to `cockroach start`. [#55091][#55091]

<h3 id="v20-1-7-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Reduced the memory overhead of rangefeeds (i.e., long-lived requests) which reduces the memory overhead for running [`CHANGEFEED`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds)s over large tables. [#54632][#54632]

<h3 id="v20-1-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where columns used in an [index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/indexes) which contained the columns of a [foreign key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/foreign-key) as a prefix could lead to all of the index columns being set to _NULL_ or the default value on cascade. [#54543][#54543]
- Fixed a bug causing servers to crash with the message "committed txn with writeTooOld". Versions below 20.1.4 are susceptible to this bug. Versions 20.1.4+ will not crash, but instead print messages to the log files. [#54282][#54282]
- Fixed a rare bug which can lead to index backfills failing in the face of [transaction restarts](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/transactions#transaction-retries). [#54859][#54859]
- Fixed a race condition propagating post-query metadata in the [vectorized execution engine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/vectorized-execution). [#55168][#55168]
- Fixed a bug causing nodes running version 20.1 to not be able to serve [follower reads](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/follower-reads) in mixed-version clusters running versions 19.2 and 20.1. [#55089][#55089]
- The first timing column in the trace.txt file collected as part of a [statement diagnostics bundle](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/explain-analyze#debug-option) has been fixed.
