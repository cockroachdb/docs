<h3 id="v20-1-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [incremental cluster backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/backup-and-restore) may have missed data written to tables while they were `OFFLINE`. In practice this can happen if a [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/restore) or [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/import) was running across incremental backups. [#63494][#63494]
- Fixed a bug where [cluster restore](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/backup-and-restore) would sometimes (very rarely) fail after retrying. [#63773][#63773]
- Fixed a bug where some of the writes of the jobs while they were running may have been missed by the backup. [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/import) and [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/restore) jobs are now restored as reverting so that they cleanup after themselves.  [#63773][#63773]
- Fixed a rare issue that caused [replica divergence](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/architecture/replication-layer). When it occurred, it was reported by the replica consistency checker, typically within 24 hours of occurrence, which would terminate the nodes. [#63475][#63475]
