<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-4-{{ site.data.products.enterprise | downcase | replace: " ", "-" }}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could have led to duplicate instances of a single [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/change-data-capture-overview) job running for prolonged periods of time. [#70921][#70921]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/cluster-settings#settings) `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.qps_threshold`, and `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.sample_rate` have been removed. A new setting, `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.max_event_frequency` has been introduced, with a default value of 10 events per second. [#70960][#70960]
- [EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/explain-analyze) now returns an error for non-system tenants, since we cannot yet support it correctly. [#70949][#70949]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Version details have been added to all [JSON formatted log entries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/log-formats#format-json). Refer to the [reference](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/eventlog) for details about the field. [#70450][#70450]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Removed the link to Statement Details on the [Session table](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-sessions-page) [#70805][#70805]
- A new column, **Interval Start Time (UTC)**, has been added to both the [Statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-statements-page) and [Transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-transactions-page) tables. The column represents the start time in UTC of the statistics aggregation interval for a statement. By default, the aggregation interval is 1 hour. **Interval Start Time** has been added to the [Statement details page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-statements-page#statement-details-page).  A new query parameter has been added to Statement details page. If the search param `aggregated_ts` is set, it will display the statement details for statements aggregated at that interval. If unset, it will display the statement details for the statement aggregated over the date range. [#70895][#70895]
- The [**Terminate Session** and **Terminate Statement** buttons](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-sessions-page#session-details) have been temporarily disabled on the Sessions page. [#71014][#71014]
- Updated color, fonts, and spaces on the [Statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-statements-page), [Statements Details](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-statements-page#statement-details-page), [Transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-transactions-page), [Transactions Details](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-transactions-page#transaction-details-page), and [Sessions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-sessions-page) pages [#71020][#71020]
- Fixed a bug where the [Clock Offset graph](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-runtime-dashboard) rendered incorrectly on nodes with multiple stores. [#70468][#70468]
- Fixed a bug where replicas awaiting to be garbage collected were causing the [Range Report](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-debug-pages) page to not load at all due to a JS error. The page will now load and display an empty **Replica Type** while in this state. [#70211][#70211]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The selected app name in the [Statements page of the DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/ui-statements-page) is now derived from the route parameters. [#71024][#71024]
- Fixed a bug that addresses an issue in Pebble where a key can be dropped from an LSM snapshot if the key was deleted by a range tombstone after the snapshot was acquired. [#70969][#70969]
- The Statement details page in the Cloud console now filters statements by the provided `aggregated_ts` query parameter. [#71081][#71081]
