Release Date: March 12, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v25-1-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `optimizer_check_input_min_row_count` session setting to control the minimum row count estimate for buffer scans of foreign key and uniqueness checks. It defaults to `0`.
 [#141374][#141374]

<h3 id="v25-1-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The **Paused Follower** graph has been removed from the **Replication Dashboard** in DB Console because followers are no longer paused by default in CockroachDB v25.1 and later.
 [#141502][#141502]

<h3 id="v25-1-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented starting multi-table logical data replication (LDR) streams on tables that contained user-defined types.
 [#141643][#141643]
- Fixed a bug where dropping a table with a trigger using the legacy schema changer could leave an orphaned reference in the descriptor. This issue occurred when two tables depended on each other via a trigger, and the table containing the trigger was dropped.
 [#141181][#141181]
- Fixed a bug that could cause the upgrade to v25.1 to crash if a job was missing from the virtual table, such as when a malformed job had no payload information.
 [#142312][#142312]
- A step in the v25.1 upgrade finalization process that required backfilling jobs now uses locks to ensure it makes progress even when there is contention on the jobs table, which prevents the possibility of becoming stuck under heavy load.
 [#141460][#141460]
- Fixed a bug that could cause concurrent DML statements to prevent primary key changes from succeeding.
 [#141383][#141383]
- Fixed a bug that could cause gateway nodes to panic when performing an `UPSERT` on a table with a `BOOL` primary key column and a partial index where the primary key column is used as the predicate expression.
 [#141822][#141822]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to fail if a database was offline (e.g., due to a `RESTORE` on that database).
 [#141505][#141505]
- Fixed a bug that prevented transaction retry errors encountered during implicit transactions from being automatically retried internally if the `autocommit_before_ddl` session variable was enabled and the statement was a schema change.
 [#141393][#141393]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `nil pointer dereference` errors when executing statements with user-defined functions (UDFs) or certain built-in functions, such as `obj_description`.
 [#141653][#141653]
- Improved S3 credential caching for STS credentials to avoid exceeding the Amazon metadata service rate limit and encountering errors related to AssumeRole API calls when accessing large numbers of files in larger clusters.
