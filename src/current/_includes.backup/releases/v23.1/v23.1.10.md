- Removed buggy [TTL]({% link v23.1/row-level-ttl.md %}) descriptor repair. In v23.1.9, upgrading from v22.2 to v23.1.9 incorrectly removed TTL storage parameters from tables (visible by running `SHOW CREATE TABLE <ttl-table>;`) while attempting to repair the table descriptors. This resulted in the node that attempted to run the TTL job crashing due to a panic caused by the missing TTL storage parameters. Clusters currently on v22.2 should upgrade to v23.1.10 and higher, **not** to v23.1.9. [#110569][#110569]
