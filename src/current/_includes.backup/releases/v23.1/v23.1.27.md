<h3 id="v23-1-27-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare bug where a [lease transfer]({% link v23.1/architecture/replication-layer.md %}#epoch-based-leases-table-data) could lead to a `side-transport update saw closed timestamp regression` panic. The bug could occur when a node was [overloaded]({% link v23.1/ui-overload-dashboard.md %}) and failing to heartbeat its [node liveness]({% link v23.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.md %}#node-liveness-issues) record.
