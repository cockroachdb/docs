<h3 id="v22-1-15-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- SQL queries running on remote nodes now show up in CPU profiles with `distsql.*` labels. Currently, these include `appname`, `gateway`, `txn`, and `stmt`. [#97055][#97055]

<h3 id="v22-1-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where a node with a [disk stall](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#disk-stalls) would continue to accept new connections and preserve existing connections until the disk was no longer stalled. [#96369][#96369]
- Fixed a bug where a [disk stall](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#disk-stalls) could go undetected under the rare circumstance that several goroutines simultaneously sync the data directory. [#96666][#96666]
- Fixed a race condition where some operations waiting on locks could cause the lockholder [transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/transactions) to be aborted if they occurred before the transaction could write its record. [#95215][#95215]
- Fixed a bug where the [**Statement Details** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-statements-page#statement-details-page) was unable to render. [#97057][#97057]
