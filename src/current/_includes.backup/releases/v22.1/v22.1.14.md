## v22.1.14

Release Date: February 6, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-14-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/copy-from) now logs an error during the insert phase on the [`SQL_EXEC`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/logging#sql_exec) logging channel. [#95175][#95175]
- If `copy_from_retries_enabled` is set, [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/copy-from) is now able to retry under certain safe circumstances. For example, when `copy_from_atomic_enabled` is false, there is no transaction running `COPY` and the error returned is retriable. [#95505][#95505]
- `kv.bulkio.write_metadata_sst.enabled` now defaults to false. This change does not affect [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/backup) or [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/restore). [#96017][#96017]

<h3 id="v22-1-14-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Removed the [**Reset SQL stats**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-statements-page) and [**Reset index stats**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-databases-page#index-details) buttons from the DB Console for non-admin users. [#95325][#95325]
- [Graphs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-overview-dashboard) can now be clicked on to toggle legend "stickiness" and make the points stop following the mouse. This makes it easier to read dense graphs with many series plotted together. [#94786][#94786]

<h3 id="v22-1-14-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where, in a cluster with nodes running both [v22.2]({% link releases/v22.2.md %}) and v22.1, [range replica](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-replication-dashboard#review-of-cockroachdb-terminology) changes could sometimes fail on v22.1 leaseholders with the error `change replicas of r47 failed: descriptor changed: [expected] != [actual]`, without any apparent differences between the listed descriptors. Continuing to upgrade all nodes to v22.2 or rolling all nodes back to v22.1 would resolve this issue. [#94841][#94841]
- It is now possible to run [`cockroach version`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroach-version) and [`cockroach start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroach-start) (and possibly other sub-commands) when the user running the command does not have permission to access the current working directory. [#94926][#94926]
- Fixed a bug where [`CLOSE ALL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/sql-grammar#close_cursor_stmt) would not respect the `ALL` flag and would instead attempt to close a cursor with no name. [#95440][#95440]
- Fixed a crash that could happen when formatting a tuple with an unknown type. [#95422][#95422]
- Fixed a bug where a [database restore](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/restore) would not [grant](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/grant) `CREATE` and `USAGE` on the public schema to the public [role](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/security-reference/authorization#users-and-roles). [#95537][#95537]
- Fixed a bug where [`pg_get_indexdef`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/functions-and-operators) didn't show the expression used to define an [expression-based index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/partial-indexes), as well as a bug where the function was incorrectly including columns stored by the index. [#95585][#95585]
- Fixed a bug where a DNS lookup was performed during gossip remote forwarding while holding the gossip mutex. This could cause processing stalls if the DNS server was slow to respond. [#95441][#95441]
- Fixed a bug where [`RESTORE SYSTEM USERS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/restore#restoring-users-from-system-users-backup) would fail to restore [role options](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/security-reference/authorization#role-options). [#95295][#95295]
- Reduce contention between queries to register, deregister, and cancel [sessions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/show-sessions). [#95654][#95654]
- Fixed a bug where a [backup](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/backup) of keys with many revisions would fail with `pebble: keys must be added in order`. [#95446][#95446]
- Fixed the `array_to_string` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/functions-and-operators) so that nested arrays are traversed without printing [`ARRAY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/array) at each nesting level. [#95844][#95844]
- Fixed a bug that caused [ranges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/architecture/overview#architecture-range) to remain without a leaseholder in cases of asymmetric [network partitions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#network-partition). [#95237][#95237]
- Fixed a bug where [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/copy-from) into a column with [collated strings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/collate) would result in an error similar to `internal error: unknown type collatedstring`. [#96039][#96039]
- Fixed a bug where spurious [transaction restarts](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/common-errors#restart-transaction) could occur when validating a [`FOREIGN KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/foreign-key) in the same transaction where the referenced table is modified. If the transaction was running at [`PRIORITY HIGH`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/transactions#transaction-priorities), deadlocks could occur. [#96124][#96124]
