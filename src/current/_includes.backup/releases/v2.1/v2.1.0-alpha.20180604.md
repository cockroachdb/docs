Release Date: {{ include.release_date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

This release includes general usability enhancements and bug fixes as well as:

- [**Easier data migrations from MySQL**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/migration-overview): The `IMPORT` feature now supports a subset of MySQL export formats. We will continue to make migrations easier in the alphas leading up to 2.1.

Please give this feature and the ones below a try. If you see something that can be improved, we’d love to hear from you on [GitHub](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues) or the [Forum](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/).

<h3 id="v2-1-0-alpha-20180604-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- New clusters and existing clusters [upgraded](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/upgrade-cockroach-version) to this version of CockroachDB will include two new empty databases, `defaultdb` and `postgres`. The `defaultdb` database is automatically used for clients that connect without a current database set (e.g., without a database component in the connection URL). The `postgres` database is provided for compatibility with PostgreSQL client frameworks that require it to exist when the database server has been freshly installed. Both new databases behave like any other regular database and, if deemed unnecessary, can be [manually deleted](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/drop-database). [#24735][#24735] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The new `compactor.threshold_bytes` and `max_record_age` [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cluster-settings) can be used to configure the compactor. [#25397][#25397] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- After [upgrading a cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/upgrade-cockroach-version) from v2.0 to v2.1, it is no longer necessary to manually finalize the upgrade. [#24987][#24987]

<h3 id="v2-1-0-alpha-20180604-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- [Collated strings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/collate) can now be used in `WHERE` clauses on indexed columns. [#25169][#25169]
- The new `CANCEL QUERIES` and `CANCEL SESSIONS` variants of the [`CANCEL QUERY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-query) and [`CANCEL SESSION`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-session) statements cancel multiple queries or sessions at once. Likewise, the new `CANCEL/PAUSE/RESUME JOBS` variants of the [`CANCEL JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-job), [`PAUSE JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/pause-job), and [`RESUME JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/resume-job) statements operate on multiple jobs at once. [#25157][#25157] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `Level` and `Type` columns of [`EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/explain) results are now hidden; if they are needed, they can be `SELECT`ed explicitly. [#25172][#25172] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- All users now automatically belong to the new `public` role. This role makes it possible to grant privileges on an object for all users at once, e.g., `GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO public;`. [#25099][#25099]
- The binary Postgres wire format is now supported for [`INTERVAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/interval) values. [#25242][#25242] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Prevented [`DROP TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/drop-table) from using too much CPU. [#24983][#24983]
- Improved [`SET TRACING`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/set-vars#set-tracing) so that a client can more easily trace around a statement that produce errors. [#25262][#25262]
- Added the `generate_subscripts()` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/functions-and-operators). [#25295][#25295] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Improved the documentation of the `now()`, `current_time()`, `current_date()`, `current_timestamp()`,
`clock_timestamp()`, `statement_timestamp()`, and `cluster_logical_timestamp()` [built-in functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/functions-and-operators). [#25327][#25327] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Running [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/truncate) without `CASCADE` on a table that has interleaved table children now returns an error instead of proceeding to delete both tables. [#25265][#25265] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Tuples can now be labeled using the new grammar `((1,2,3) AS a,b,c)`. [#25283][#25283] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Labeled tuples can now be accessed using their labels, but doing so requires an extra level of parentheses, e.g., `SELECT (((1,'2',true) AS a, b, c)).a`. [#25810][#25810]
- [`SHOW TRACE FOR <stmt>`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/) now runs `<stmt>` through the [DistSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/architecture/sql-layer#distsql) execution engine, if supported. `SHOW KV TRACE FOR <stmt>` still runs `<stmt>` through local SQL. [#24709][#24709] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Introduced two experimental scalar operators, `IFERROR()` and `ISERROR()`. They may be documented for public use in the future. [#25304][#25304]
- The `server.time_until_store_dead` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cluster-settings) can no longer be set to less than `1m15s`. Setting it to lower values was previously allowed but not safe, since it can cause bad rebalancing behavior. [#25598][#25598] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`CANCEL JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-job) can now be executed on long-running schema change jobs, causing them to terminate early and roll back. [#25571][#25571] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `array_to_string()` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/functions-and-operators). [#25681][#25681] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import) now supports MySQL's tabbed `OUTFILE` format. [#25615][#25615] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import) now supports `mysqldump` SQL as a data format. [#25783][#25783] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The experimental lookup join feature now supports secondary indexes. [#25628][#25628] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Stored, computed columns can now be converted to regular columns by running `ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c DROP STORED`. [#25819][#25819] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The experimental lookup join feature now supports left outer joins. [#25644][#25644] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/truncate) commands are now logged in the event log. [#25868][#25868]
- Improved [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import) error messages. [#26032][#26032]

<h3 id="v2-1-0-alpha-20180604-command-line-changes">Command-Line Changes</h3>

- Changing or removing a [replication zone](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones) config now causes events to be written to the system event log. [#25250][#25250]
- Messages that refer to an invoked command (e.g., "Failed running start") are no longer confused by the presence of flags before the first argument (e.g., `cockroach --no-color start`). [#25246][#25246]
- Typos in [replication zone constraints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones#replication-constraints) are now validated. When they are set, required attributes and localities must match at least one node in the cluster. [#25421][#25421] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v2-1-0-alpha-20180604-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- Running unit tests for the Admin UI now depends on the installation of Google Chrome. [#25140][#25140]
- Added RocksDB compactions/flushes to Storage graphs. [#25428][#25428]
- Added a Stores report page, including encryption status. [#26040][#26040]
- Removed time selectors and tier labels during [Node Map](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/enable-node-map) setup. [#25280][#25280]

<h3 id="v2-1-0-alpha-20180604-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client) command once again does not prompt for a password when a certificate is provided. [#25252][#25252]
- Corrected the behavior of `GREATEST` and `LEAST` built-ins when they have a leading `NULL` argument. [#25882][#25882]
- CockroachDB now properly reports an error when using the internal-only functions `final_variance()` and `final_stddev()` instead of causing a crash. [#25158][#25158]
- The `constraint_schema` column in `information_schema.constraint_column_usage` now displays the constraint's schema instead of its catalog. [#25190][#25190] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `BEGIN; RELEASE SAVEPOINT;` now returns and error instead of causing a crash. [#25247][#25247]
- Fix a bug where the sessions endpoint on the Admin UI would return an error when there was an active transaction. [#25249][#25249]
- Corrected the CockroachDB-specific, currently undocumented conversion from [`INTERVAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/interval) to/from numeric types. [#25257][#25257]
- Fixed problems with [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import) sometimes failing after node decommissioning. [#25162][#25162]
- Prevented queries that use placeholders for tuple types from causing a crash. [#25269][#25269]
- Fixed a rare `segfault` that occurred when reading from an invalid memory location returned from C++. [#25347][#25347]
- Fixed a bug with `IS DISTINCT FROM` not returning `NULL` values that pass the condition in some cases. [#25336][#25336]
- Restarting a CockroachDB server on Windows no longer fails due to file system locks in the store directory. [#25267][#25267]
- Prevented the consistency checker from deadlocking. This would previously manifest itself as a steady number of replicas queued for consistency checking on one or more nodes and would resolve by restarting the affected nodes. [#25456][#25456]
- Fixed a crash in some cases when using a `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`. [#25574][#25574]
- Fixed a nil pointer dereference when importing data containing date values. [#25661][#25661]
- Numeric literal values no longer silently lose information after a certain precision. [#25597][#25597]
- Prevented spurious `BudgetExceededErrors` for some queries that read a lot of [`JSON`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/jsonb) data from disk. [#25679][#25679]
- Fixed query errors in some cases involving a `NULL` constant that is cast to a specific type. [#25735][#25735]
- Fixed a crash when trying to plan certain `UNION ALL` queries. [#25747][#25747]
- Fixed a crash caused by inserting data into a table with [computed columns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/computed-columns) that reference other columns not present in the `INSERT` statement. [#25682][#25682]
- `EXPLAIN (DISTSQL)` now properly reports that plans containing subqueries cannot be run through the [DistSQL execution engine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/architecture/sql-layer#distsql). [#25618][#25618]
- CockroachDB no longer crashes if the control statements `CANCEL`/`PAUSE`/`RESUME` are given values using special PostgreSQL types (e.g., `NAME`). [#25844][#25844]
- Fixed a panic when using unordered aggregations. [#26042][#26042]
- Fixed an error caused by [`INET`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/inet) constants in some rare cases. [#26086][#26086]
- Fixed an error caused by empty arrays in some cases. [#26090][#26090]
- Previously, expired compactions could stay in the queue forever. Now, they are removed when they expire. [#26039][#26039]
- Fixed problems using tables with [foreign key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/foreign-key) or [interleaved](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/interleave-in-parent) references to other tables when the tables were created in the same transaction. [#25786][#25786]

<h3 id="v2-1-0-alpha-20180604-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

[#3192][#3192]
- Added best practices on [understanding and avoiding transaction contention](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/performance-best-practices-overview#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) and a related [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/operational-faqs#why-would-increasing-the-number-of-nodes-not-result-in-more-operations-per-second). [#3156][#3156]
- Improved the documentation of [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/as-of-system-time). [#3155][#3155]
- Expanded the [manual deployment](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/manual-deployment) guides to cover running a sample workload against a cluster. [#3149][#3149]
