<h3 id="v2-1-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a panic on [`UPDATE ... RETURNING *`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/update) during a schema change. [#32591][#32591]
- Fixed a panic on [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/upsert) in the middle of a schema change adding a non-nullable column. [#32730][#32730]
- Fixed a bug that prevents adding [computed columns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/computed-columns) with the [`NOT NULL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/not-null) constraint. [#32730][#32730]
- Fixed a deadlock when using [`ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/validate-constraint) in a transaction with a schema change. [#32850][#32850]
- Prevented a performance degradation related to overly aggressive Raft log truncations that could occur during [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/restore) or [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import) operations.
- Prevented a stall in the processing of Raft snapshots when many snapshots are requested at the same time. [#32414][#32414]
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-changefeed) now escape Kafka topic names, when necessary. [#32235][#32235] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-changefeed) now spend dramatically less time flushing Kafka writes. [#32235][#32235]
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-changefeed) with the `experimental_avro` option now work with column `WIDTH`s and `PRECISION`s. [#32484][#32484] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed a bug where Raft proposals could get stuck if forwarded to a leader who could not itself append a new entry to its log. [#32600][#32600]
- Fixed a bug where calling [`CREATE STATISTICS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-statistics) on a large table could cause the server to crash due to running out of memory. [#32635][#32635]
- Fixed a bug that could cause data loss bug when a disk becomes temporarily full. [#32633][#32633]
- CockroachDB now reports an unimplemented error when a `WHERE` clause is used after [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/insert). [#32558][#32558] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now properly handles [foreign key cascading actions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/foreign-key#foreign-key-actions) `SET DEFAULT` and `SET NULL` in [`SHOW CREATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/show-create) and [`cockroach dump`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/sql-dump). [#32630][#32630]
- Fixed a crash that could occur during or after a data import on Windows. [#32666][#32666]
- Lookup joins now properly preserve ordering for outer joins. Previously, under specific conditions, `LEFT JOIN` queries could produce results that did not respect the `ORDER BY` clause. [#32678][#32678]
- CockroachDB once again enables `admin` users, including `root`, to list all user sessions besides their own. [#32709][#32709]

- Dates no longer have a time component in their text encoding over the wire. [#32661][#32661]
- Corrected binary decimal encoding for `NaN`. [#32661][#32661]
- Prevented a panic when encountering an internal error related to invalid entries in the output of [`SHOW SESSIONS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/show-sessions). [#32742][#32742]
- Prevented a panic when running certain subqueries that get planned in a distributed fashion. [#32670][#32670]
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-changefeed) emitting into Kafka more quickly notice new partitions. [#32757][#32757]
- CockroachDB now properly records statistics for sessions where the value of `application_name` is given by the client during initialization instead of `SET`. [#32755][#32755]
- CockroachDB now properly evaluates [`CHECK`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/check) constraints after a row conflict in [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/insert) when the `CHECK` constraint depends on a column not assigned by `DO UPDATE SET`. [#32780][#32780]
- The [`cockroach workload run`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cockroach-workload) subcommand no longer applies to data-only generators. [#32827][#32827] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed a bug where metadata about contended keys was inadvertently ignored, in rare cases allowing for a failure in transaction cycle detection and transaction deadlocks. [#32853][#32853]

<h3 id="v2-1-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Changed the default value for the `kv.transaction.write_pipelining_max_batch_size` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cluster-settings) to `128`. This speeds up bulk write operations. [#32621][#32621] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v2-1-2-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- Documented the [`cockroach workload`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cockroach-workload) command, which provides built-in load generators for simulating different types of client workloads, and updated various tutorials to use these workloads. [#4087](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4087)
- Expanded the [`cockroach demo`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cockroach-demo) documentation to explain the use of built-in datasets. [#4087](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4087)
- Added a secure version of the [Performance Tuning](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/performance-tuning) tutorial. [#4123](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4123)
- Clarified that primary key columns cannot be [stored with a secondary index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-index). [#4098](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4098)  
- Clarified when to use [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/delete) vs. [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/truncate). [#4094](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4094)
- Added important considerations when setting up [clock synchronization](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/recommended-production-settings#clock-synchronization).
- Clarified the documentation on [automatic transaction retries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/transactions#automatic-retries). [#4044](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4044)
