<h3 id="v2-1-0-enterprise-features">Enterprise Features</h3>

These new features require an [enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/enterprise-licensing). Register for a 30-day trial license [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/).

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[Change Data Capture](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/change-data-capture) (Beta)|  Change data capture (CDC) provides efficient, distributed, row-level change feeds into Apache Kafka for downstream processing such as reporting, caching, or full-text indexing. Use the [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-changefeed) statement to create a new changefeed, which provides row-level change subscriptions.
[Encryption at Rest](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/encryption) (Experimental) | Encryption at Rest provides transparent encryption of a node's data on the local disk.
[`EXPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/export) (Beta)| The `EXPORT` statement exports tabular data or the results of arbitrary SELECT statements to CSV files. Using the CockroachDB [distributed execution engine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/architecture/sql-layer#distsql), `EXPORT` parallelizes CSV creation across all nodes in the cluster, making it possible to quickly get large sets of data out of CockroachDB in a format that can be ingested by downstream systems.

<h3 id="v2-1-0-core-features">Core Features</h3>

These new features are freely available in the core version and do not require an enterprise license.

<h3 id="v2-1-0-sql">SQL</h3>

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER TYPE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/alter-type) | The `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER TYPE` statement changes a column's [data type](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/data-types). Only type changes that neither require data checks nor data conversion are supported at this time.
[`ALTER COLUMN ... DROP STORED`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/alter-column#convert-a-computed-column-into-a-regular-column) | The `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... DROP STORED` statement converts a stored, [computed column](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/computed-columns) into a regular column.
[`CANCEL JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-job) | The `CANCEL JOB` statement can now be executed on long-running schema change jobs, causing them to terminate early and roll back. Also, the `CANCEL JOBS` variant of the statement lets you cancel multiple jobs at once.
[`CANCEL QUERIES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-query) | The `CANCEL QUERIES` variant of the `CANCEL QUERY` statement lets you cancel multiple queries at once.
[`CANCEL SESSIONS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cancel-session) | The `CANCEL SESSIONS` variant of the `CANCEL SESSION` statement lets you stop multiple long-running sessions. `CANCEL SESSION` will attempt to cancel the currently active query and end the session.
[Cost-Based Optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cost-based-optimizer) | The cost-based optimizer seeks the lowest cost for a query, usually related to time. In versions 2.1 and later, CockroachDB's cost-based optimizer is enabled by default.
[`CREATE STATISTICS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-statistics) (Experimental) | The `CREATE STATISTICS` statement generates table statistics for the [cost-based optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cost-based-optimizer) to use.
[`EXPLAIN (DISTSQL)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/explain#distsql-option) | The `DISTSQL` option generates a physical query plan for a query. Query plans provide information around SQL execution, which can be used to troubleshoot slow queries.
[`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/explain-analyze) | The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement executes a SQL query and returns a physical query plan with execution statistics.
[Fast Deletes for Interleaved Tables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/interleave-in-parent#benefits) | Under certain conditions, deleting rows from interleave tables that use [`ON DELETE CASCADE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/add-constraint#add-the-foreign-key-constraint-with-cascade) will use an optimized code path and run much faster.
[Lookup Joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/joins#lookup-joins) (Experimental) | A lookup join is beneficial to use when there is a large imbalance in size between the two tables, as it only reads the smaller table and then looks up matches in the larger table. A lookup join requires that the right-hand (i.e., larger) table is indexed on the equality column.
[`public` Role](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/authorization#create-and-manage-roles) | All users now belong to the `public` role, to which you can [grant](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/grant) and [revoke](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/revoke) privileges.
[`SET` (session variable)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/set-vars)<br>[`SHOW` (session variable)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/show-vars) | Added the following options: <ul><li>`statement_timeout`: The amount of time a statement can run before being stopped.</li><li>`optimizer`: The mode in which a query execution plan is generated. If set to `on`, the cost-based optimizer is enabled by default and the heuristic planner will only be used if the query is not supported by the cost-based optimizer; if set to `off`, all queries are run through the legacy heuristic planner.</li></ul>
[`SHOW STATISTICS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/show-statistics) (Experimental) | The `SHOW STATISTICS` statement lists [table statistics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-statistics) used by the [cost-based optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cost-based-optimizer).
[`SNAPSHOT` isolation level](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/transactions#isolation-levels) | **Removed.** Transactions that request to use `SNAPSHOT` are now mapped to [`SERIALIZABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/demo-serializable).
[Subquery Support](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/subqueries#correlated-subqueries) | CockroachDB's [cost-based optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cost-based-optimizer) supports several common types of correlated subqueries. A subquery is said to be "correlated" when it uses table or column names defined in the surrounding query.

<h3 id="v2-1-0-cli">CLI</h3>

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[`cockroach demo`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/cockroach-demo) | The `cockroach demo` command starts a temporary, in-memory, single-node CockroachDB cluster and opens an [interactive SQL shell](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client) to it.
[`cockroach start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/start-a-node) | The new `--advertise-addr` flag recognizes both a hostname/address and port and replaces the `--advertise-host` and `--advertise-port` flags, which are now deprecated.<br><br>The new `--listen-addr` flag recognizes both a hostname/address and port and replaces the `--host` and `--port` flags, which are now deprecated for `cockroach start` but remain valid for other client commands.<br><br>The new `--http-addr` flag recognizes both a hostname/address and port and replaces the `--http-host` flag, which is now deprecated.
[`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client) | The `cockroach sql` command and other client commands that display SQL results now use the new table result formatter by default, replacing the previous formatter called `pretty`. This provides more compact and more reusable results.
`cockroach zone` | **Deprecated.** The `cockroach zone` command has been deprecated. To manage [replication zones](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones), use the [`CONFIGURE ZONE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-zone) statement to [add](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones#create-a-replication-zone-for-a-system-range), [modify](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones#edit-the-default-replication-zone), [reset](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones#reset-a-replication-zone), and [remove](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones#remove-a-replication-zone) replication zones.

<h3 id="v2-1-0-operations">Operations</h3>

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[Controlling Leaseholder Location](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones#constrain-leaseholders-to-specific-datacenters) | Using replication zones, you can now specify preferences for where a range's leaseholders should be placed to increase performance in some scenarios.
[DBeaver Support](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/third-party-database-tools) | DBeaver, a cross-platform database GUI, has been thoroughly vetted and tested with CockroachDB v2.1.
[Load-based Rebalancing](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/architecture/replication-layer#membership-changes-rebalance-repair) | In addition to the rebalancing that occurs when nodes join or leave a cluster, leases and replicas are rebalanced automatically based on the relative load across the nodes within a cluster. Note that depending on the needs of your deployment, you can exercise additional control over the location of leases and replicas by [configuring replication zones](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/configure-replication-zones).
[Migration from Postgres and MySQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/migration-overview) | The `IMPORT` command now supports importing dump files from Postgres and MySQL.
[Monitoring Kubernetes Deployments](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes) | Kubernetes tutorials now feature steps on how to integrate with[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), an open source tool for storing, aggregating, and querying timeseries data, and set up [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/).
[Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Deployments](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes-multi-cluster) | You can now orchestrate a secure CockroachDB deployment across three Kubernetes clusters, each in a different geographic region, using the StatefulSet feature to manage the containers within each cluster and linking them together via DNS.
[Pipelining of Transactional Writes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/architecture/transaction-layer#transaction-pipelining) | Transactional writes are pipelined when being replicated and when being written to disk, dramatically reducing the latency of transactions that perform multiple writes.
[Preferring Local Networks](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/start-a-node)| The new `--locality-advertise-addr` flag on [`cockroach start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/start-a-node#networking) can be used to tell nodes in specific localities to prefer local or private interfaces. This flag is useful when running a cluster across multiple networks, where nodes in a given network have access to a private or local interface while nodes outside the network do not.
[Rolling Upgrade Auto-finalization](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/upgrade-cockroach-version) | By default, as soon as all nodes are running CockroachDB v2.1, the upgrade process will be **auto-finalized**. This will enable certain performance improvements and bug fixes introduced in the new version.
[Viewing Node Status for an Unavailable Cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/view-node-details) | The `cockroach node status` command can now be run even when majority of nodes are down. Running the command now shows an additional field: `is_available.`

<h3 id="v2-1-0-admin-ui">Admin UI</h3>

Feature | Description
