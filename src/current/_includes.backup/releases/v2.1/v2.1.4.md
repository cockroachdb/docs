<h3 id="v2-1-4-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- It is now possible to use AWS S3 temporary credentials for [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/backup)/[`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/restore) and [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import)/[`EXPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/export) using the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` parameter in the URL.

<h3 id="v2-1-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added support for the `pg_catalog` introspection table `pg_am` for both PostgreSQL versions 9.5 and 9.6, which changed the table significantly. [#33276][#33276]
- Previously, CockroachDB did not consider the value of the right operand for `<<` and `>>` operators, resulting in potentially very large results and excessive RAM consumption. This has been fixed to restrict the range of these values to that supported for the left operand. [#33247][#33247]
- Attempts to use some PostgreSQL built-in functions that are not yet supported in CockroachDB now cause a clearer error message, and also become reported in [diagnostics reporting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/diagnostics-reporting), if diagnostics reporting is enabled, so as to gauge demand.

<h3 id="v2-1-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where schema changes could get stuck for 5 minutes when executed immediately after a server restart. [#33062][#33062]
- Fixed a bug with returning dropped unique columns in [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/delete) statements with `RETURNING`. [#33541][#33541]
- [`CHANGEFEED`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/create-changefeed)s and incremental [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/backup)s no longer indefinitely hang under an infrequent condition. [#33141][#33141]
- The output of [`cockroach node status --ranges`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/view-node-details) previously listed the count of under-replicated ranges in the `ranges_unavailable` column and the number of unavailable ranges in the `ranges_underreplicated` column. This fixes that mix-up. [#32951][#32951]
- Fixed a possible goroutine leak when canceling queries. [#33137][#33137]
- Cancel requests (via the pgwire protocol) now close quickly with an EOF instead of hanging but still do not cancel the request. [#33246][#33246]
- Fixed pgwire binary decoding of decimal `NaN` and `NULL` values in arrays. [#33306][#33306]
- The [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/upsert) and [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/insert) statements now properly check that the user has the `SELECT` privilege on the target table. [#33359][#33359]
- CockroachDB does not crash upon running [`SHOW SESSIONS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/show-sessions), [`SHOW QUERIES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/show-queries), and inspections of some `crdb_internal` tables when certain SQL sessions are issuing internal SQL queries. [#33261][#33261]
- CockroachDB no longer reports under-replicated ranges corresponding to replicas that are waiting to be deleted. [#33407][#33407]
- Fixed a panic that could result from not supplying a nullable column in an [`INSERT ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/insert) statement. [#33309][#33309]
- Resolved a cluster degradation scenario that could occur during [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/import)/[`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/restore) operations, which manifested through a high number of pending Raft snapshots.  [#33587][#33587]
- Fixed a panic caused by some queries involving lookup joins where an input ordering must be preserved. [#33522][#33522]
- Prevented a panic with certain queries that use the statement source (square bracket) syntax. [#33723][#33723]
- [Window functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/window-functions) with non-empty `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are now handled correctly when invoked via an external driver. [#33671][#33671]

<h3 id="v2-1-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved the execution plans of some queries using `LIKE`. [#33072][#33072]

<h3 id="v2-1-4-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- The new [Life of a Distributed Transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction) details the path that a query takes through CockroachDB's architecture, starting with a SQL client and progressing all the way to RocksDB (and then back out again). [#4281](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4281)
- Updated the [Production Checklist](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/recommended-production-settings) with more current hardware recommendations and additional guidance on storage, file systems, and clock synch. [#4153](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4153)
- Expanded the [SQLAlchemy tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.1/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-sqlalchemy) to provide code for transaction retries and best practices for using SQLAlchemy with CockroachDB. [#4142](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4142)
