<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20171218-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Added support for read-only [transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/transactions) via PostgreSQL-compatible syntax. [#20547](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20547)
    - `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION READ ONLY/READ WRITE`
    - `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY/READ WRITE`
    - `SET default_transaction_read_only`
    - `SET transaction_read_only`
- For compatibility with PostgreSQL, the return type of the `date_trunc(STRING,TIME)` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/functions-and-operators) was changed from `TIME` to `INTERVAL`, and the return type of the `date_trunc(STRING,DATE)` function was changed from `DATE` to `TIMESTAMPTZ`. [#20467](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20467)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20171218-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug preventing CockroachDB from starting when the filesystem generates a `lost+found` directory in the Cockroach data directory. [#20565](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20565)
- Fixed the over-counting of memory usage by aggregations. [#20585](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20585)
- Fix a panic when using the `date_trunc(STRING,TIMESTAMP)` or `date_trunc(STRING,DATE)` function during queries that run with the distributed execution engine. [#20467](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20467)
- Fixed a bug where the `date_trunc(STRING,TIMESTAMP)` function would return a `TIMESTAMPTZ` value. [#20467](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20467)
- Fixed a race condition that would result in some queries hanging after cancellation. [#20088](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20088)
- Fixed a bug allowing [privileges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/privileges) to be granted to non-existent users. [#20438](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20438)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20171218-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Queries that use inequalities using tuples (e.g., `(a,b,c) < (x,y,z)`) are now slightly better optimized. [#20484](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20484)
- `IS DISTINCT FROM` and `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` clauses are now smarter about using available indexes. [#20346](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20346)
