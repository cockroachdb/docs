- [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/import) no longer silently converts `rn` characters in CSV files into `n`. [#28225][#28225]

- Limited the size of "batch groups" when committing a batch to RocksDB to avoid rare scenarios in which multi-gigabyte batch groups are created, which can cause a server to run out of memory when replaying the RocksDB log at startup. [#28009][#28009]
- Prevented unbounded growth of the Raft log caused by a loss of quorum. [#27868][#27868]

[#3352][#3352]
- Expanded the [Kubernetes tutorials](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes) to include setting up monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Alertmanager. [#3370][#3370]
