<h3 id="v1-1-6-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- Disabling [diagnostics reporting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/diagnostics-reporting) also disables new version notification checks. [#23008][#23008]

<h3 id="v1-1-6-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Prevented disruptions in performance when gracefully shutting down a node. [#23302][#23302]
- Fixed a zero QPS scenario when gracefully shutting down a node. [#23306][#23306]
- Fixed a panic caused by empty `COCKROACH_UPDATE_CHECK_URL` or `COCKROACH_USAGE_REPORT_URL` environment variables. [#23008][#23008]
- The conversion from [`INTERVAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/interval) to [`FLOAT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/float) now properly returns the number of seconds in the interval. [#22893][#22893]
- Fixed a bug that caused queries of virtual tables with an explicit database name prefix (e.g., `select * from mydb.crdb_internal.tables`) to not get scrubbed properly in [diagnostics reporting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/diagnostics-reporting). [#22815][#22815]
- A `COMMIT` reporting an error generated by a previous parallel statement (i.e., `RETURNING NOTHING`) no longer leaves the connection in an aborted transaction state. Instead, the transaction is considered completed and a `ROLLBACK` is not necessary. [#22814][#22814]
- Fixed an issue with stale buffer data when using the binary format for [`ARRAY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/array) values. [#22262][#22262]
- Fixed a bug that caused SQL connection errors during node startup. [#22663][#22663]
- Fixed a bug that included [decommissioned nodes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/remove-nodes) in cluster stats aggregates. [#22864][#22864]
