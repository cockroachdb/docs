<h3 id="v22-2-8-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- [Backup schedules](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/manage-a-backup-schedule) created or altered to have the option `on_previous_running` will now have the full backup schedule created with the user specified option, but will override the incremental backup schedule to always default to `on_previous_running = wait`. This prevents duplicate incremental jobs from racing against each other, and ensures correctness of the backup chains created by the incremental schedule. [#98860][#98860]
- [AVRO](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/changefeed-messages#avro) schema registry URIs now allow you to change the default timeout for contacting the schema registry by setting the query parameter `timeout=T`. [#99505][#99505]

<h3 id="v22-2-8-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed the helper message on the [UPDATE](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/update) statement to correctly position the optional `FROM` clause. [#99299][#99299]
- Added a new `prepared_statements_cache_size` [session setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/set-vars) which, when set to a non-zero number of bytes, causes the least recently-used prepared statements to be automatically deallocated when prepared statement memory usage goes above the cache size. This setting can be used to avoid prepared statement leaks from long-lived connections which never `DEALLOCATE` prepared statements. [#99259][#99259]
- Added two new [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) that enable users to change the number of histogram samples and buckets collected when building histograms as part of table statistics collection: `sql.stats.histogram_samples.count` and `sql.stats.histogram_buckets.count`. [#100544][#100544]

<h3 id="v22-2-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `kv.trace.slow_request_stacks.threshold` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) can be used to attach available stack history from tracer snapshots to slow requests traces. [#99738][#99738]

<h3 id="v22-2-8-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- New data on the [Statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-statements-page) and [Transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-transactions-page) pages is now automatically fetched every five minutes. [#99271][#99271]
- On DB Console [Stats](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-statements-page) pages, you can now issue a new request for stats while a previous request is pending. The new request replaces the previous request. [#99271][#99271]

<h3 id="v22-2-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where prepared statements using placeholders in recursive [common table expressions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/common-table-expressions) did not always re-optimize after placeholders were resolved. [#100327][#100327]
- Fixed a bug where glob patterns that did not match tables in [`GRANT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/grant) or [`REVOKE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/revoke) statements would return an internal error with a confusing message instead of the `"no objects matched"` error. [#99437][#99437]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.2.0, where the node could crash with the error `"attempting to append refresh spans after the tracked timestamp has moved forward"` in some rare cases. To work around this issue until you can upgrade, run `SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.distsql.use_streamer.enabled = false;`. [#99445][#99445]
- Fixed a bug where the node could crash when a statement used `cluster_logical_timestamp()` as a [`DEFAULT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/default-value) expression. [#99662][#99662]
- The [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES ... ON FUNCTIONS ...`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/alter-default-privileges) statement is no longer allowed unless all nodes are running on v22.2 and the upgrade is finalized.  This command could cause a node still running v22.1 to crash in a mixed-version cluster. [#99845][#99845]
- Fixed a bug where the [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/truncate) GC job can be stuck in running status if the table descriptor has been GCed. This happened because `TRUNCATE TABLE` creates new empty indexes, then replaces and drops the original indexes. The dropped indexes data are deleted and GCed within the `TRUNCATE TABLE` GC job, which are needed to see the table descriptor make progress. However, if the table data has been GCed, the job couldn't make progress. This patch makes the GC job able to handle the missing descriptor edge case and let the `TRUNCATE TABLE` GC job succeed. [#100137][#100137]
- Fixed a bug introduced before v21.2 that would cause the gateway node to crash if there are self-referencing [views](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/views). [#100163][#100163]
- Fixed a bug where queries reading from virtual tables such as those in the `crdb_internal` and `pg_catalog` system catalogs could hang indefinitely if the query would result in an error. [#99968][#99968]
- In rare cases involving schema changes on an overloaded cluster, users could sometimes, transiently, see errors of the form `"deadline below read timestamp is nonsensical; txn has would have no chance to commit"`. These errors carried an internal pgcode and could not be retried. This form of error is now classified as a retryable error and will be retried automatically either by the client or internally. [#100255][#100255]
- Fixed a bug where the `sql.mem.distsql.current` metric would count the memory usage of remote DistSQL flows twice. [#100254][#100254]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a cached query with a [user-defined type](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-type) reference from being invalidated, even after a schema change that should prevent the type from being resolved. [#100223][#100223]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a cached query from being invalidated when a [user-defined function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/user-defined-functions) referenced by that query was altered or dropped. [#100223][#100223]
- Fixed a bug where [user-defined functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/user-defined-functions) were introduced that could cause a function call to resolve to the wrong function after changes to the schema search path. [#100223][#100223]
- Fixed a rare bug introduced before v22.1 that could cause a projected expression to replace column references with incorrect values. [#97593][#97593]
- Fixed a bug in the new [declarative schema changer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/online-schema-changes.html#declarative-schema-changer) that could cause primary index corruption when an `ALTER TABLE..ADD COLUMN` statement executed concurrently with an `UPDATE` or `INSERT` statement if the schema change failed and was rolled back. [#100187][#100187]

<h3 id="v22-2-8-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Removed prettify usages that could cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors on the [Statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-statements-page) and [Transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-transactions-page) pages. [#99453][#99453]
- Audit logging now looks up the names of tables, views, and sequences in a node's lease cache to reduce network latency. [#99661][#99661]
- The execution of multiple [`FOREIGN KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/foreign-key) and [`UNIQUE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/unique) constraint checks can be parallelized in some cases to help them complete more quickly. faster, especially so in multi-region environments where the checks require cross-region reads. This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, set the private (undocumented) `sql.distsql.parallelize_checks.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) to `true`. [#100520][#100520]
