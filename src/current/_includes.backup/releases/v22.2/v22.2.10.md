Release Date: May 30, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-10-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Responses from the [Cluster API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-api) now escape special characters in database names, such as spaces. [#102896][#102896]
- The new [session variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/set-vars) `optimizer_use_improved_computed_column_filters_derivation` allows the optimizer to derive filters on computed columns in more cases. This session variable defaults to `false`. [#103424][#103424]
- Keys are now redacted in the following internal tables, and can be viewed only by users with the `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` role: <ul><li><code>crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events</code></li><li><code>crdb_internal.node_contention_events</code></li><li><code>crdb_internal.cluster_locks</code></li></ul>The `crdb_internal.node_contention_events` table can now be viewed only by users with the `admin`, `VIEWACTIVITY` or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` role. [#103644][#103644]

<h3 id="v22-2-10-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Timeseries metric counts now show the cumulative count for histograms rather than the windowed count. A `-sum` timeseries is now exported for each histogram, to keep track of the cumulative sum of all samples in the histogram. [#103447][#103447]
- The following metrics are now exported to help troubleshoot issues when the `admission.elastic_cpu.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) is enabled:

    - `admission.elastic_cpu.nanos_exhausted_duration`
    - `admission.elastic_cpu.over_limit_duration`
    - `admission.elastic_cpu.pre_work_nanos`
    - `admission.elastic_cpu.available_nanos`

<h3 id="v22-2-10-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [Cluster Overview](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-cluster-overview-page) page now shows an alert immediately when the cluster setting `cluster.preserve_downgrade_option` is set, instead of only after 48 hours. [#102912][#102912]
- If a DB Console page crashes in a web browser, a forcible refresh is no longer required to view other DB Console pages. [#103327][#103327]
- The [Databases](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-databases-page) and [Table Details](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-databases-page#table-details) pages now allow you to filter and search results. [#103593][#103593]

<h3 id="v22-2-10-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in v21.1 that allowed values to be inserted into an `ARRAY`-type column that did not conform to the inner type of the array. For example, it was possible to insert `ARRAY['foo']` into a column of type `CHAR(1)[]`. This could cause incorrect results when querying the table. Such an insert now results in an error. [#102810][#102810]
- Fixed a bug where backup or restore of a synthetic schema such as `system.public` would cause the node to crash. [#102782][#102782]
- Fixed a bug where an asymmetric network partition could allow a node to erroneously update a closed timestamp for a lease that was transferred away from it after it missed a liveness heartbeat. This could lead to a closed timestamp invariant violation and could cause a node to crash. In an extreme case, it could cause inconsistencies in read-only queries. This fix changes the the order of availability checks so that a node's `PROSCRIBED` status is now evaluated before its `UNAVAILABLE` status. [#102599][#102599]
- Fixed a rare bug introduced in v22.2.0, where a job that uses [row-level TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/row-level-ttl) could incorrectly process a table that spans multiple ranges. When you encounter this bug, an error such as the following is logged: `error decoding EncDatum ...: did not find terminator ... in buffer ...`. [#102914][#102914]
- The value of `pg_constraint.conparentid` is now `0` rather than `NULL`. CockroachDB does not support constraints on partitions. [#103232][#103232]
- Fixed a bug where a previously-added filter condition could not be removed in the [Statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-statements-page) page. [#103415][#103415]
- Fixed a rare bug introduced in v22.1.0, where a query that uses the `ORDER BY` clause could return incorrect results if **all** of the following conditions are met: <ul><li>The query has both an `ORDER BY` clause and a `LIMIT` clause.</li><li>The sort operation uses enough memory that it spills to disk.</li><li>The `ORDER BY` clause contains multiple columns.</li><li>The ordering on the prefix of the `LIMIT BY` columns was already provided by an index.</ul> [#102789][#102789]
- Fixed a rare bug introduced in v22.2.9 that could cause a node due to a `NULL` pointer in the code that populates [SQL Activity](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-statements-page) pages. [#103522][#103522]
- Fixed a bug that could cause excessively slow backups when the `admission.elastic_cpu.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) was enabled. [#103648][#103648]
- Fixed a bug where a node could crash if placeholder arguments are used with the [`to_timestamp()` built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#date-and-time-functions) (for example, `with_min_timestamp(to_timestamp($1))`). [#103646][#103646]
- Fixed a bug where removed regions are not cleaned up correctly after a restore. To fix this issue, `SET PRIMARY REGION` and `SET SECONDARY REGION` now validate transactionally. [#103634][#103634]

<h3 id="v22-2-10-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved performance of [SQL audit logging](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/sql-audit-logging), which now uses the lease cache to help resolve the names of tables, views, and sequences. [#102831][#102831]
- A query can now be [constrained](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/constraints) using a computed column expression that is part of an index, as long as the query's `IN` clause or `OR` clause includes the columns referenced by the computed column expression. [#103424][#103424]
