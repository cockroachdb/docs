<h3 id="v19-1-4-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- The new `skip_missing_views` option for [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/restore) skips restoring views that cannot be restored because their dependencies are not being restored at the same time. [#38773][#38773] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-1-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now ignores non-fatal errors updating jobs during [`DROP TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/drop-table). [#38821][#38821]
- The first statement of a transaction no longer returns a transaction retry error if it is an [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/update) or [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/delete) (this was already true for [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/insert)). [#39087][#39087]

<h3 id="v19-1-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented [inverted indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/inverted-indexes) from being created on [`JSONB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/jsonb) columns containing `NULL` values. [#38747][#38747]
- Ranges consisting of only one row (and historical versions of that row) are now correctly up-replicated. [#38588][#38588]
- Fixed a planning error that caused valid queries to fail with the error "rowCount passed in was too small". [#38793][#38793]
- Fixed incorrect results, or "unordered span" errors, in some cases involving exclusive inequalities with non-numeric types. [#38896][#38896]
- Fixed a bug in the [cost-based optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/cost-based-optimizer) causing a bad index for [lookup joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/joins#lookup-joins) in some cases. [#39028][#39028]
- Fixed a potential infinite loop in queries involving reverse scans. [#39101][#39101]
- [`UPSERT`s](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/upsert) planned by the [cost-based optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/cost-based-optimizer) that use [lookup joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/joins#lookup-joins) run during column mutations on the table being updated no longer cause crashes or other issues. [#38917][#38917]
- `crdb_internal.ranges` can now be used inside [views](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.1/views). Note that such views can become invalid in future releases if `crdb_internal.ranges` changes. [#39213][#39213]
