<h3 id="beta-20161027-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Functions that return the current time - including `now()` - now return values of type [`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) instead of `TIMESTAMP`, unless called from a context that expects the latter type. [#9618](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9618)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- [Views](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/views) are now supported. Views are stored queries, represented as virtual tables, that produce a result set when requested. They can be used to hide query complexity, limit access to underlying data, or simplify the process of supporting legacy code.  
- Tables in the `pg_catalog` database can now be accessed with unqualified names if no table of the same name exists in the current database. [#9927](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9927)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries now support the decimal format returned by `cluster_logical_timestamp()` for maximum precision. [#9934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9934)
- The `CASCADE` option of [`DROP TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/drop-table) and [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/alter-table) now drops views that depend on the table or column; it is now an error to attempt to drop a table or column with dependent views without either using this option or dropping the views first. [#9724](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9724), [#10124](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10124)
- `SET DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_ISOLATION` is now supported, improving compatibility with `psycopg2`. [#10087](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10087)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_indexes` and `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` tables are now supported. [#9869](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9869), [#9991](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9991)
- [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/explain) can now be used with `SHOW`, `HELP`, and `ALTER TABLE ... SPLIT`. [#10013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10013)
- The `current_schemas()` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) is now supported, improving compatibility with ActiveRecord. [#9604](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9604)
- The [`SHOW ALL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/show-vars) statement is now supported. [#10195](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10195)
- The [`DROP INDEX`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/drop-index) and [`ALTER INDEX`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/rename-index) statements can now use unqualified index names. [#10091](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10091)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- The `--host` flag in [client commands](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/cockroach-commands) such as [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) now defaults to `localhost` in both secure and insecure modes. [#10134](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10134)
- Improved error messages when a server is down or certificates are not configured correctly. [#9917](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9917)
- The `--key` flag can now be passed via the [environment variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/cockroach-commands#environment-variables) `COCKROACH_KEY`, matching other similar flags. [#10092](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10092)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- RocksDB bloom filters now use 10x less memory, with a negligible reduction in speed. [#10085](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10085)
- Old time-series data is now garbage collected. [#9959](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9959)
- Reduced overhead of the internal time-series metric system. [#9889](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9889)
- Reduced impact of schema changes on regular queries. [#9798](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9798)
- In the event of a node failure, schema changes now save their progress and can resume from their last checkpoint instead of restarting from the beginning. [#10036](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10036)
- Ranges are now split more eagerly when tables are created or data is growing rapidly. [#10232](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10232)

<h3 id="beta-20161027-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Certain network- and timeout-related errors will now return the error "transaction commit result is ambiguous" when it cannot be determined whether a transaction committed or not. This fixes bugs in which statements outside of transactions could be applied twice, and other transactions may incorrectly report unique constraint violations. [#10207](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10207)
- [`SET TIME ZONE 0`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/set-vars#set-time-zone) now sets the session time zone to UTC (other numbers already worked). [#9992](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9992)
- `SHOW` statements for session variables now work correctly when prepared and executed separately. [#10013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10013)
- Columns that are a part of the primary key can now be renamed. [#10018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10018)
- Fixed a panic during transaction rollback. [#9961](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9961)
- Float comparisons involving `NaN` are now correct in all cases. [#10112](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10112)
- Clock offset monitoring is now more sensitive. [#10185](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10185)
- The rebalancer is now better able to avoid placing a replica on a store that has previously had a corrupted replica of the same range. [#10141](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10141)
- More complex expressions involving window functions are now supported. [#10186](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10186)
- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when using the Prometheus metrics endpoint. [#10228](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10228)
