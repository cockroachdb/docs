- CockroachDB has reverted to RocksDB 4.8. [#9118](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9118)
- The logging format has changed to include a goroutine ID. [#8977](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8977)
- CockroachDB now builds correctly when Git worktrees are used; as a consequence Git version 2.5 or newer is now required when [building from source](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/install-cockroachdb). [#9072](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9072)

<h3 id="beta-20160908-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- If any [environment variables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/cockroach-commands#environment-variables) are used to configure the server, the names of those variables are printed to the logs. [#9069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9069)

- Fixed a bug that would result in the server locking up after a few hours on a machine or VM with only one CPU. [#8908](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8908)
- Fixed another cause of persistently broken connections on node restarts. [#8947](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8947)

- The replica garbage collection process is no longer confused by uninitialized replicas. [#9021](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9021)
- Fixed various data races. [#8865](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8865), [#8933](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8933)

- GRPC request tracing has been disabled due to its memory cost. [#9113](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9113)
