<h3 id="beta-20160512-new-features">New Features</h3>

- The [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/insert) statement now accepts an `ON CONFLICT` clause, for a more flexible alternative to `UPSERT`. [#6591](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6591)
- The new [`EXPLAIN (TYPES)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/explain) subcommand prints information about the types of expressions in a statement. [#6482](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6482)
- Added the aggregate functions [`BOOL_AND()`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) and [`BOOL_OR()`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators). [#6535](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6535)
- The aggregate functions [`SUM(INT)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) and [`AVG(INT)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) now return `DECIMAL` instead of `INT` and `FLOAT` respectively. [#6532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6532)
- The new command-line flag [`--raft-tick-interval`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/start-a-node) allows the raft heartbeat frequency to be changed in high-latency deployments. [#6615](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6615)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) values can now be cast to type `STRING`. [#6605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6605)
- The [`CREATE DATABASE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/create-database) statement now accepts an `ENCODING` option for compatibility with PostgreSQL, although `UTF8` is the only supported encoding. [#6614](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6614)

<h3 id="beta-20160512-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug when a single [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/insert) statement inserts multiple values for the same primary key. [#6564](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6564)
- Fixed an inconsistency that could occur when a transaction in [`SNAPSHOT` isolation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/transactions#isolation-levels) used the internal `DeleteRange` operation. [#6548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6548)
- Fixed an integer underflow that could result in log messages like `transport: http2Server received 4294965918-bytes`. [#6567](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6567)
- Long-running transactions are no longer allowed to exceed their table descriptor lease. [#6418](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6418)
- Subtracting an `INTERVAL` from a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` returns a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` instead of one without a time zone. [#6540](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6540)
- Improved type checking of comparisons involving tuples. [#6517](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6517)
- [`CREATE TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/create-table), [`ALTER TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/alter-table), and [`DROP INDEX`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/drop-index) now do more validation of their arguments. [#6492](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6492)

<h3 id="beta-20160512-performance-improvments">Performance improvments</h3>
