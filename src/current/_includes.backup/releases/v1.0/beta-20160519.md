<h3 id="beta-20160519-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) values are now truncated to microsecond resolution when sent over the network for compatibility with the PostgreSQL protocol. The `format_timestamp_ns(ts)` or `extract(nanosecond from ts)` [functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) can be used to access the full nanosecond precision of a timestamp. The `now()`, `current_timestamp()`, and `statement_timestamp()` functions are truncated to microsecond resolution to avoid confusion when timestamp values are used in unique indexes; the new `current_timestamp_ns()` function can be used to get a non-truncated timestamp. [#6604](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6604)
