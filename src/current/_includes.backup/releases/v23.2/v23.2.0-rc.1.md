Release Date: December 21, 2023

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-0-rc-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added a SQL function `crdb_internal.fips_ready()` that can be used to verify the [FIPS](../v23.2/fips.html) readiness of the gateway node. [#116281][#116281]
- [Physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) now retries for just over 3 minutes before failing. [#116404][#116404]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-rc-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `CALL` statements can now be run with [`EXPLAIN`](../v23.2/explain.html). The `EXPLAIN (OPT)` variant will show the body of the procedure, while other variants will show only the procedure name and arguments. [#116273][#116273]
- Added support for [`IMPORT INTO`](../v23.2/import-into.html) a table that has columns typed as arrays of user-defined types (like [`ENUM`](../v23.2/enum.html)). Tables that use multiple user-defined types with the same name but different schemas are still unsupported. [#116360][#116360]
- The [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](../v23.2/select-for-update.html) implementation used under Read Committed isolation (and under [Serializable isolation](../v23.2/demo-serializable.html) when [`optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable`](../v23.2/set-vars.html) is set to `true`) now locks all [column families](../v23.2/column-families.html) instead of only the first column family. [#116828][#116828]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-rc-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Added the command [`cockroach debug enterprise-check-fips`](../v23.2/cockroach-commands.html) that diagnoses errors in [FIPS](../v23.2/fips.html) deployments. [#116281][#116281]
- Added the flag `--enterprise-require-fips-ready` that can be run with any [CockroachDB command](../v23.2/cockroach-commands.html) to prevent startup if certain prerequisites for [FIPS](../v23.2/fips.html) compliance are not met. [#116281][#116281]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-rc-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Updated the **CPU Time** label to **SQL CPU Time** and added clarification to its tooltip on the [SQL Activity](../v23.2/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) and [Insights](../v23.2/ui-insights-page.html) pages. [#116450][#116450]
- Removed the ID when it is `undefined` from the event description in the [Metrics Events Panel](../v23.2/ui-overview-dashboard.html#events-panel). [#116519][#116519]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused node crashes and panics when running [`INSERT`](../v23.2/insert.html) queries on [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v23.2/table-localities.html#regional-by-row-tables) tables with `UNIQUE` constraints or indexes. The bug is only present in version v23.2.0-beta.1. [#116343][#116343]
- [`UPDATE`](../v23.2/update.html), [`UPSERT`](../v23.2/upsert.html), and [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](../v23.2/insert.html#on-conflict-clause) queries are now disallowed under Read Committed isolation when the table contains a [`CHECK` constraint](../v23.2/check.html) involving a [column family](../v23.2/column-families.html) that is updated, and that `CHECK` constraint also involves a column family that is **not** updated, but **is** read. This restriction is a temporary fix to prevent possible violation of the `CHECK` constraint. However, it is important to note that this restriction will be lifted in the future. [#116429][#116429]
- Fixed a bug where [scheduled jobs](../v23.2/show-schedules.html) using [external storage providers](../v23.2/use-cloud-storage.html) may fail shortly after node startup. [#116205][#116205]
- Fixed the formatting for `plpgsql` routines, which could prevent the creation of a routine with loop labels and could prevent some expressions from being redacted correctly. The bug only existed in alpha and beta versions of v23.2. [#116711][#116711]
- Fixed a bug that would cause a syntax error during redaction of a PL/pgSQL routine. The bug existed only in alpha and beta versions of the v23.2 release. [#116711][#116711]
- Fixed a bug that would cause syntax errors when attempting to [restore a database](../v23.2/restore.html#restore-a-database) with [PL/pgSQL UDFs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html) or stored [procedures](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createprocedure.html). This bug only affected alpha and beta versions of v23.2. [#116711][#116711]
- Fixed a bug in PL/pgSQL where altering the name of a [sequence](../v23.2/create-sequence.html) or UDT that was used in a [PL/pgSQL function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html) or [procedure](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createprocedure.html) could break them. This is only present in v23.2 alpha and beta releases. [#116420][#116420]
- Fixed a bug where [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](../v23.2/select-for-update.html) under Read Committed isolation on multi-column-family tables was not locking [column families](../v23.2/column-families.html) containing only key columns. [#116828][#116828]
- Fixed a bug where all `AggHistogram`-powered metrics were not reporting quantiles properly in the [DB Console](../v23.2/ui-overview.html). The quantiles in the DB Console are now reported correctly. This bug was only present in histograms in the [DB Console metrics](../v23.2/ui-overview-dashboard.html) features, and did **not** affect metrics reporting in the [Prometheus-compatible](../v23.2/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.html) endpoint, `/_status/vars`. The affected metrics were:
    - `changefeed.message_size_hist`
    - `changefeed.parallel_io_queue_nanos`
    - `changefeed.sink_batch_hist_nanos`
    - `changefeed.flush_hist_nanos`
    - `changefeed.commit_latency`
    - `changefeed.admit_latency`
    - `jobs.row_level_ttl.span_total_duration`
    - `jobs.row_level_ttl.select_duration`
    - `jobs.row_level_ttl.delete_duration`
