## v23.2.0-alpha.4

Release Date: October 23, 2023

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Updated the `licenses/CCT.txt` file to reflect the latest [Cockroachdb Community License](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/cockroachdb-community-license/). [#112494][#112494]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Renamed [cluster settings](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) related to [physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) for consistency. For example, `bulkio.stream_ingestion.minimum_flush_interval` is now `physical_replication.consumer.minimum_flush_interval`. [#111197][#111197]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`SHOW SCHEDULES`](../v23.2/show-schedules.html) has two columns that surface the schedule options. These columns have been renamed to align with the documented option names: `on_previous_running` and `on_execution_failure`. [#111759][#111759]
- Added support for the [PLpgSQL `CLOSE` statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-cursors.html#PLPGSQL-CURSOR-USING-CLOSE), which allows a PLpgSQL routine to close a cursor with the name specified by a cursor variable. [#111330][#111330]
- When a [`RESTORE`](../v23.2/restore.html) with `remove_regions` is performed, the restore job will now fail if the object contains a [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v23.2/table-localities.html#regional-by-row-tables) table. [#111443][#111443]
- It is now possible to open a [cursor](../v23.2/cursors.html) within a PLpgSQL function or procedure with an exception block. If an error occurs, creation of the cursor is rolled back before control reaches the exception handler. [#111735][#111735]
- If a [scheduled backup](../v23.2/create-schedule-for-backup.html) resumes on a new cluster (e.g., after [physical cluster replication cutover](../v23.2/cutover-replication.html) or a cluster restore), the backup schedule will pause. The user may [resume the schedule](../v23.2/resume-schedules.html) without changing it, but should take special care to ensure no other schedule is backing up to the same [collection](../v23.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#backup-collections). The user may also want to cancel the paused schedule and start a new one. [#111578][#111578]
- Added support for PLpgSQL [`FETCH`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-cursors.html#PLPGSQL-CURSOR-USING-FETCH) and [`MOVE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-cursors.html#PLPGSQL-CURSOR-USING-MOVE) statements. Similar to SQL `FETCH`/`MOVE` statements, commands that would seek the [cursor](../v23.2/cursors.html) backward will fail. In addition, expressions other than constant integers are not yet supported for the `count` option. [#111318][#111318]
- Added support for the [`REFCURSOR`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-cursors.html#PLPGSQL-CURSOR-DECLARATIONS) data type. `REFCURSOR` is a special string type that is used to handle cursors. PLpgSQL cursor declarations are required to use a variable of type `REFCURSOR`, and the name of a cursor can be passed to and from a PLpgSQL function or procedure. [#111392][#111392]
- Added two changes to [`FOR UPDATE`](../v23.2/select-for-update.html):
    - Multiple `FOR UPDATE` clauses on fully parenthesized queries are now disallowed. For example, the following statements are now disallowed:

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ sql
        (SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE) FOR UPDATE;
        SELECT * FROM ((SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE) FOR UPDATE) AS x;
        ~~~

        Whereas statements like the following are still allowed:

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ sql
        SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE) AS x FOR UPDATE;
        SELECT (SELECT 1 FOR UPDATE) FOR UPDATE;
        ~~~

        This does not match PostgreSQL, which allows all of these, but does match CockroachDB behavior for `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.
    - `FOR UPDATE` is now allowed on statements with `VALUES` in the `FROM` list, or as a subquery. For example, the following statements are now allowed:

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ sql
        SELECT (VALUES (1)) FOR UPDATE;
        SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1)) AS x FOR UPDATE;
        ~~~

        Using `FOR UPDATE` directly on `VALUES` is still disallowed:

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ sql
        VALUES (1) FOR UPDATE; (VALUES (1)) FOR UPDATE;
        INSERT INTO t VALUES (1) FOR UPDATE;
        ~~~

        This matches PostgreSQL. [#111258][#111258]
- `FOR UPDATE` is now permitted on some queries that were previously disallowed. Queries that use the following operations are now allowed to have `FOR UPDATE OF` as long as the prohibited operation is in a subquery not locked by the `FOR UPDATE OF`:
    - `UNION`
    - `INTERSECT`
    - `EXCEPT`
    - `DISTINCT`
    - `GROUP BY`
    - `HAVING`
    - Aggregations
    - [Window functions](../v23.2/window-functions.html)

    For example, the following query is now allowed because the subquery using the prohibited operations is not affected by the `FOR UPDATE OF`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SELECT * FROM t, (SELECT DISTINCT 0, 0 UNION SELECT a, count(*) FROM t GROUP BY a HAVING a > 0) AS u FOR UPDATE OF t;
    ~~~

    This matches PostgreSQL. [#111258][#111258]
- Identifiers after numeric constants that are not separated by whitespace are now disallowed to match PostgreSQL 15 behavior. [#112021][#112021]
- Added the new column `contention_type` to the [`crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events`](../v23.2/crdb-internal.html) table. This column indicates the type of [transaction contention](../v23.2/performance-best-practices-overview.html#transaction-contention) encountered. Current values are `LOCK_WAIT` and `SERIALIZATION_CONFLICT`. [#111685][#111685]
- Changed the error message: `statement error cannot execute FOR UPDATE in a read-only transaction` to `statement error cannot execute SELECT FOR UPDATE in a read-only transaction` to match PostgreSQL. [#112138][#112138]
- Added a new [session variable](../v23.2/set-vars.html) `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable`, which when set enables a new implementation of `SELECT FOR UPDATE`. This new implementation of `SELECT FOR UPDATE` acquires row locks **after** any joins and filtering, and always acquires row locks on the primary index of the table being locked. This more closely matches [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](../v23.2/select-for-update.html) behavior in PostgreSQL, but at the cost of more round trips from gateway node to replica leaseholder. Under read-committed isolation (and other isolation levels weaker than serializable), CockroachDB will always use this new implementation of `SELECT FOR UPDATE` regardless of the value of `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` to ensure correctness. [#112138][#112138]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `server.http.base_path` that controls the redirection of the browser after successful login with [OIDC SSO](../v23.2/sso-db-console.html). It is unlikely that this setting would need adjustment. However, it is helpful in cases where CockroachDB is running behind a load balancer or proxy that serves CockroachDB under a subpath, such as `https:// <hostname>/crdb/ `. In those cases, it is necessary for the browser to redirect to `/ crdb` after login instead of `/`, which has always been the hard-coded default. [#111283][#111283]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-cluster-virtualization">Cluster virtualization</h3>

- The following settings can now only be set from the system virtual cluster:
    - All the `physical_replication.*` settings
    - `server.rangelog.ttl`
    - `timeseries.storage.*`

    [#111769][#111769]
- The [cluster settings](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `cluster.organization` and `enterprise.license` can now only be set via the system virtual cluster. Attempting to set them from any other virtual cluster results in an error. [#111788][#111788]
- A new flag `--internal-rpc-port-range` allows operators to specify the port range used by virtual clusters for node-to-node communication. Users implementing [physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) or cluster virtualization public preview features should use this flag if they require the `cockroach` processes to only communicate using ports in a known port range. [#111798][#111798]
- Two guardrails are available to system operators to help with users upgrading from a deployment without cluster virtualization enabled to a deployment using cluster virtualization. This is intended to help in cases where the user is not connected to the correct SQL interface to perform certain configuration operations. There are two guardrails included:
    - The `sql.restrict_system_interface.enabled` cluster setting encourages users to use a virtual cluster for their application workload. When set, certain common operations that end users may execute to set up an application workload are disallowed, such as running DDL statements or modifying an application level cluster setting. Users will receive an error similar to:

        ~~~
        ERROR: blocked DDL from the system interface SQLSTATE: 42501 HINT: Object creation blocked via sql.restrict_system_interface.enabled to prevent likely user errors. Try running the DDL from a virtual cluster instead.
        ~~~
    - The `sql.error_tip_system_interface.enabled` cluster setting enhances errors reported when a user mistakenly uses a storage-level SQL feature within any virtual cluster besides the system virtual cluster. For example, when attempting to modify a cluster setting that was previously at the application level, an error like the following occurs:

        ~~~
        NOTICE: ignoring attempt to modify "kv.rangefeed.enabled"
        HINT: The setting is only modifiable by the operator.
        Normally, an error would be reported, but the operation is silently accepted here as configured by "sql.error_tip_system_interface.enabled".
        ~~~

    - For a cluster setting that was always system-level, an error like the following occurs:

        ~~~
        ERROR: cannot modify storage-level setting from virtual cluster
        SQLSTATE: 42501
        HINT: Connect to the system interface and modify the cluster setting from there.
        ~~~

        [#111568][#111568]
- The predefined config profiles related to cluster virtualization now automatically set the new [cluster settings](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.restrict_system_interface.enabled` and `sql.error_tip_system_interface.enabled`. [#111568][#111568]
- The hidden `--secondary-tenant-port-offset` option has been removed. Users who were previously using this option should use `--internal-rpc-port-range` instead. [#112050][#112050]
- Added support for automatic finalization of a virtual cluster's version upgrade. A new setting `cluster.auto_upgrade.enabled` was added to enable and disable automatic cluster version upgrade (finalization). It will be used in automatic upgrade of both the storage cluster and its virtual clusters. [#102427][#102427]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- [`cockroach debug zip`](../v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html) has an additional flag that is default off `include-running-job-traces` that will enable collecting the in-flight traces of traceable jobs, such as [backup](../v23.2/backup.html), [restore](../v23.2/restore.html), [import](../v23.2/import-into.html), [physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) and dump them in a `jobs/` subdirectory in the zip. [#112644][#112644]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**Jobs** table](../v23.2/ui-jobs-page.html) will now correctly display timestamps for creation, last modified, and the completed time fields. [#110366][#110366]
- The [transaction insight details](../v23.2/ui-insights-page.html) will show the following details when CockroachDB has information on a transaction execution with a `40001` error code and it has captured the conflicting transaction meta details (only available if the transaction had not yet committed at the time of execution). A section called `Failed Execution` will appear when this information is available and it will contain:
    - Blocking transaction execution ID
    - Blocking transaction fingerprint ID
    - Conflict location
    - Database, table, and index names [#111873][#111873]
- Added progressive loading functionality to the [Databases page](../v23.2/ui-databases-page.html). [#110901][#110901]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in [physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) where the primary cluster would not be able to take [backups](../v23.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) when a primary cluster node was unavailable. [#111337][#111337]
- Fixed a bug in [transaction insight details](../v23.2/ui-insights-page.html) where it was possible to see the contention details of other transactions. Now, CockroachDB will only surface contention details for the current transaction. [#111867][#111867]
- [Voter constraints](../v23.2/configure-replication-zones.html) will now be satisfied by promoting existing non-voters. Previously, there was a bug where voter constraints were never satisfied due to all existing replicas being considered necessary to satisfy a replica constraint. [#111609][#111609]
- Fixed a bug where `indoption` inside `pg_index` was not properly encoded causing clients to be unable to decode it as `int2vector`. [#111911][#111911]
- This patch fixes an issue where the [optimizer](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) fails to honor the `statement_timeout` session setting when generating constrained index scans for queries with large `IN` lists or `= ANY` predicates on multiple index key columns, which may lead to an out of memory condition on the node. [#111979][#111979]
- This patch fixes a performance issue in join queries with a `LIMIT` clause, where the [optimizer](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) may fail to push a `WHERE` clause filter into a join due to how the `LIMIT` operation is internally rewritten. This causes a full scan of the table referenced in the filter. [#110593][#110593]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors during query optimization in rare cases. The bug has been present since version v2.1.11, but it is more likely to occur in version v21.2.0 and later, though it is still rare. The bug only presents when a query contains `min` and `max` [aggregate functions](../v23.2/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions). [#112255][#112255]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- This patch adds support for insert fast-path uniqueness checks on [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v23.2/table-localities.html#regional-by-row-tables) tables where the source is a `VALUES` clause with a single row. This results in a reduction in latency for single-row inserts to `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables and hash-sharded `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables with unique indexes. [#111822][#111822]
