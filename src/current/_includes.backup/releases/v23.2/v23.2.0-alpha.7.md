<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-7-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Previously, if [session variable `use_declarative_schema_changer`](../v23.2/session-variables.html#use_declarative_schema_changer) was set to `off`, then [`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL`](../v23.2/alter-table.html#alter-column) was run on a column which contained a NULL value, an error with code `23514` (`check_violation`) would be returned. Now in this scenario the error returned will have code 23502 (`not_null_violation`) to match [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/errcodes-appendix.html). [#113970][#113970]
- The `sql.txn.read_committed_syntax.enabled` [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) was renamed to [`sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled`](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-txn-read-committed-isolation-enabled). [#113833][#113833]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-7-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The `cockroach connect` functionality has been deprecated. [#114241][#114241]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-7-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Previously, the forward arrow button on the [time selector](../v23.2/ui-statements-page.html#time-interval) would not move the time window forward if the current end time was less than "Now() - time window". For example, with a 10 minute time window, it was not possible to move forward if current end time is less that "Now() - 10 minutes". This caused the forward arrow button to become disabled even though there was more data to display. Now this scenario is handled by the forward arrow button selecting the latest available time window (similar to the **Now** button). [#113907][#113907]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Removed duplication of metrics names on [DB Console Metrics](../v23.2/ui-overview.html#metrics) charts' tooltips. [#113728][#113728]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [ALTER DATABASE ... ADD/DROP REGION](../v23.2/alter-database.html#add-region) to hang if [node localities](../v23.2/cockroach-start.html#locality) were changed after regions were added. [#114102][#114102]
- A bug in the [log configuration](../v23.2/configure-logs.html) code prevented users from setting the [`datetime-format` and `datetime-timezone` log format options](../v23.2/configure-logs.html#datetime-field-for-json-format) (set via the `format-options` structure) within their log configuration. Specifically, when users tried to use these options in `file-defaults` with any [`json`](../v23.2/log-formats.html#format-json) type log format, the log configuration was previously unable to be parsed due to validation errors. This was because the `file-defaults.format-options` were propagated to the `sinks.stderr.format-options`. `sinks.stderr` only supports a format of [`crdb-v2-tty`](../v23.2/log-formats.html#format-crdb-v2-tty). Therefore, the incorrectly propagated `format-options`, which are only supported by the `json` log format, were identified as not being supported when validating `sinks.stderr`. This bug is now fixed and the `file-defaults.format-options` are only propagated to `sinks.stderr.format-options` if both of these conditions are true: 1. `file-defaults.format` is one of [`crdb-v2`](../v23.2/log-formats.html#format-crdb-v2) or `crdb-v2-tty`. 2. `sinks.stderr.format-options` are not explicitly set in the log configuration. [#113684][#113684]
- Previously, when executing queries with [index joins](../v23.2/indexes.html#storing-columns) or [lookup joins](../v23.2/joins.html#lookup-joins) or both when the ordering needs to be maintained, CockroachDB in some cases would get into a pathological behavior which would lead to increased query latency, possibly by one or two orders of magnitude. This bug was introduced in v22.2 and is now fixed. [#114117][#114117]
- Previously, the [SHOW STATISTICS command](../v23.2/show-statistics.html) incorrectly required the user to have the admin role. Now, it correctly only requires the user to have any [privilege](../v23.2/security-reference/authorization.html#privileges) on the table being inspected. [#114449][#114449]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a [query plan](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to skip scanning rows from the local region when performing a [lookup join](../v23.2/joins.html#lookup-joins) with a [`REGIONAL BY ROW` table](../v23.2/regional-tables.html#regional-by-row-tables) as the input. [#114458][#114458]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-7-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- This change prevents failed requests from being issued on follower nodes that are [draining, decommissioning](../v23.2/node-shutdown.html) or unhealthy which prevents latency spikes if those nodes later go offline. [#114259][#114259]
