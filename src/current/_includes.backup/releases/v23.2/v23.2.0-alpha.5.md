- Added support for the special `OTHERS` condition in PL/pgSQL exception blocks, which allows matching any error code apart from `query_canceled` and `assert_failure`. Note that Class 40 errors (`40000`, `40001`, `40003`, `40002`, and `40P01`) cannot be caught either. This is tracked in [#111446](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/111446). [#112817][#112817]

- Previously, queries with the [`ST_Union`](../v23.2/st_union.html) aggregate function could produce incorrect results in some cases due to the query optimizer performing invalid optimizations. This is now fixed. This bug had been present since the `ST_Union` function was introduced in v20.2.0. [#112780][#112780]
