## v23.2.4

Release Date: April 11, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Mutation statements such as [`UPDATE`](../v23.2/update.html) and [`DELETE`](../v23.2/delete.html) as well as locking statements such as [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](../v23.2/select-for-update.html) are not allowed in [read-only transactions](../v23.2/set-transaction.html#parameters) or [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME` transactions](../v23.2/set-transaction.html#parameters). Previously, a bug existed where mutation statements and locking statements in implicit single-statement transactions using AS OF SYSTEM TIME were allowed. [#120158][#120158]
- The new cluster setting [`sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled`](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-stats-virtual-computed-columns-enabled), when enabled, allows the collection of [table statistics](../v23.2/show-statistics.html) on [virtual computed columns](../v23.2/computed-columns.html). [#120933][#120933]
- The new [session variable](../v23.2/session-variables.html) `optimizer_use_virtual_computed_column_stats`, when enabled, configures the [cost-based optimizer](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to use [table statistics](../v23.2/show-statistics.html) on [virtual computed columns](../v23.2/computed-columns.html). [#121329]

<h3 id="v23-2-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed an issue where clusters with multiple [stores](../v23.2/cockroach-start.html#store) per node could list inaccurate region and node information on the [**Databases** page](../v23.2/ui-databases-page.html#databases). [#120212][#120212]
- Users will no longer see [views](../v23.2/views.html) displayed on the [**Databases** page](../v23.2/ui-databases-page.html#databases). Previously views would be listed with no information, only displaying errors. [#120214][#120214]

<h3 id="v23-2-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, on long-running [sessions](../v23.2/show-sessions.html) that issue many (hundreds of thousands or more) [transactions](../v23.2/transactions.html), CockroachDB's internal memory accounting system, the limit for which is configured via the [`--max-sql-memory` flag](../v23.2/cockroach-start.html#general)) could leak. This bug, in turn, could result in the error message `"root: memory budget exceeded"` for other queries. The bug was present in v23.2.3 and is now fixed. [#121875][#121875]
- Previously, [altering a table's locality](../v23.2/alter-table.html#set-locality) from [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v23.2/alter-table.html#set-the-table-locality-to-regional-by-row) to [`REGIONAL BY TABLE`](../v23.2/alter-table.html#regional-by-table) could cause [leaseholders](../v23.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) to never move to the [database's primary region](../v23.2/alter-database.html#set-primary-region). This is now fixed. [#118794][#118794]
- A user with the [`VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` privilege](../v23.2/security-reference/authorization.html#privileges) can no longer see constants inside of queries that originate from other users in the [`SHOW SESSIONS` result](../v23.2/show-sessions.html#response). Previously, this redaction did not occur. [#119884][#119884]
- Previously, the [`SHOW STATEMENTS`](../v23.2/show-statements.html) and the [`SHOW QUERIES`](../v23.2/show-statements.html#aliases) commands incorrectly required the user to have the [`VIEWACTIVITY` or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` privilege](../v23.2/security-reference/authorization.html#privileges). However, a user always should be able to view their own queries, even without these privileges. This is now fixed. [#119884][#119884]
- Fixed a bug where [`RESTORE`](../v23.2/restore.html) on certain [`BACKUP`s](../v23.2/backup.html) would open a very large number of connections to the backup storage provider. [#119883][#119883]
- Fixed a bug that occurred when using [`ALTER TABLE`](../v23.2/alter-table.html) to [drop](../v23.2/alter-table.html#drop-constraint) and [add](../v23.2/alter-table.html#add-constraint) back a [`CHECK` constraint](../v23.2/check.html) with the same name. [#120075][#120075]
- Fixed a bug in which it was possible to set [session variable](../v23.2/session-variables.html) `transaction_read_only` to `false` during an [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME` transaction](../v23.2/set-transaction.html#parameters). [#120158][#120158]
- Fixed a bug where some files were not closed when inspecting [backup metadata](../v23.2/backup-architecture.html#metadata-writing-phase) during [`BACKUP`](../v23.2/backup.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v23.2/restore.html). [#119635][#119635]
- Fixed an intermittent page crash on the [**Schema Insights**](../cockroachcloud/insights-page.html#schema-insights-tab) view. [#120210][#120210]
