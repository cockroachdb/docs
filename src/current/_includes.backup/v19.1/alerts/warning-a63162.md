Cockroach Labs has discovered a bug relating to incremental backups, for CockroachDB v19.1.0 - v19.1.11. If a backup coincides with an in-progress index creation (backfill), `RESTORE`, or `IMPORT`, it is possible that a subsequent incremental backup will not include all of the indexed, restored or imported data.

For more information, including other affected versions, see [Technical Advisory 63162](../advisories/a63162.html).
