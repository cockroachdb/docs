    The {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}**Folder Mover**{% else %}[**Folder Mover**]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#folder-mover){% endif %} role allows users to rename or move descendant folders, and move clusters within the folder hierarchy where they have the role. However, a Folder Mover cannot create or delete folders or clusters and cannot assign roles. A Folder Mover can move clusters within the folder hierarchy even if they do not have a role that allows them to connect to the cluster, such as {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}[Cluster Creator](#cluster-creator) or [Cluster Operator](#cluster-operator){% else %}[Cluster Admin]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-admin) or [Cluster Operator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-operator{% endif %}).

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    A cluster cannot be renamed.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    A user with the {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}[Organization Admin](#organization-admin) or [Folder Admin](#folder-admin){% else %}[Organization Admin]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-admin) or [Folder Admin]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#folder-admin){% endif %} role can assign another user or a service account the Folder Mover role. Because the Folder Admin role is a superset of Folder Mover, there is no need for a Folder Admin to assign themselves the Folder Mover role.
