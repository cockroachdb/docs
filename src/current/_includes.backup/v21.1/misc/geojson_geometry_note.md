The screenshots in these examples were generated using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io), but they are designed to showcase the shapes, not the map.  Representing `GEOMETRY` data in GeoJSON can lead to unexpected results if using geometries with [SRIDs](spatial-glossary.html#srid) other than 4326 (as shown below).
