Statement | SQL statement [fingerprint](ui-statements-page.html#sql-statement-fingerprints).<br><br>To view additional details, click the SQL statement fingerprint to open its [**Statement Details** page](ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page).
Execution Count | Cumulative number of executions of statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The bar indicates the ratio of runtime success (gray) to [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) (red) for the SQL statement fingerprint.
Rows Read | Average number of rows [read from disk](architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html#reads-from-the-storage-layer) while executing statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval).<br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of rows returned. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Bytes Read | Aggregation of all bytes [read from disk](architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html#reads-from-the-storage-layer) across all operators for statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of bytes read from disk. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Statement Time | Average [planning and execution time](architecture/sql-layer.html#sql-parser-planner-executor) of statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean latency. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Contention | Average time statements with this fingerprint were [in contention](performance-best-practices-overview.html#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) with other transactions within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The gray bar indicates mean contention time. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Max Memory | Maximum memory used by a statement with this fingerprint at any time during its execution within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The gray bar indicates the average max memory usage. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Network | Amount of [data transferred over the network](architecture/reads-and-writes-overview.html) (e.g., between regions and nodes) for statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>If this value is 0, the statement was executed on a single node. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of bytes sent over the network. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Retries | Cumulative number of [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) of statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval).
