You're most likely to benefit from interleaved tables when:

  - Your tables form a [hierarchy](interleave-in-parent.html#interleaved-hierarchy)
  - Queries maximize the [benefits of interleaving](interleave-in-parent.html#benefits)
  - Queries do not suffer too greatly from interleaving's [tradeoffs](interleave-in-parent.html#tradeoffs)
