You can use the hosted [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](#hosted-gke) service or the hosted [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](#hosted-eks) to quickly start Kubernetes.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The CockroachDB Kubernetes Operator is currently supported for GKE. You can also use the Operator on platforms such as [Red Hat OpenShift](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/deploy-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes-openshift.html) and [IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Hosted GKE

1. Complete the **Before You Begin** steps described in the [Google Kubernetes Engine Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart) documentation.

    This includes installing `gcloud`, which is used to create and delete Kubernetes Engine clusters, and `kubectl`, which is the command-line tool used to manage Kubernetes from your workstation.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
    The documentation offers the choice of using Google's Cloud Shell product or using a local shell on your machine. Choose to use a local shell if you want to be able to view the CockroachDB Admin UI using the steps in this guide.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

2. From your local workstation, start the Kubernetes cluster, specifying one of the available [regions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available) (e.g., `us-east1`):

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
    Since this region can differ from your default `gcloud` region, be sure to include the `--region` flag to run `gcloud` commands against this cluster.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ gcloud container clusters create cockroachdb --machine-type n2-standard-4 --region {region-name} --num-nodes 1
    ~~~

    ~~~
    Creating cluster cockroachdb...done.
    ~~~

    This creates GKE instances and joins them into a single Kubernetes cluster named `cockroachdb`. The `--region` flag specifies a [regional three-zone cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-regional-cluster), and `--num-nodes` specifies one node in each zone.

    The `--machine-type` flag tells the node pool to use the [`n2-standard-4`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types#standard_machine_types) machine type (4 vCPUs, 16 GB memory), which meets our [recommended CPU and memory configuration](recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations).

    The process can take a few minutes, so do not move on to the next step until you see a `Creating cluster cockroachdb...done` message and details about your cluster.

3. Get the email address associated with your Google Cloud account:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ gcloud info | grep Account
    ~~~

    ~~~
    Account: [your.google.cloud.email@example.org]
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
    This command returns your email address in all lowercase. However, in the next step, you must enter the address using the accurate capitalization. For example, if your address is YourName@example.com, you must use YourName@example.com and not yourname@example.com.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

4. [Create the RBAC roles](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#prerequisites_for_using_role-based_access_control) CockroachDB needs for running on GKE, using the address from the previous step:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl create clusterrolebinding $USER-cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user=<your.google.cloud.email@example.org>
    ~~~

    ~~~
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/your.username-cluster-admin-binding created
    ~~~

### Hosted EKS

1. Complete the steps described in the [EKS Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) documentation.

    This includes installing and configuring the AWS CLI and `eksctl`, which is the command-line tool used to create and delete Kubernetes clusters on EKS, and `kubectl`, which is the command-line tool used to manage Kubernetes from your workstation.

2. From your local workstation, start the Kubernetes cluster:

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
    To ensure that all 3 nodes can be placed into a different availability zone, you may want to first [confirm that at least 3 zones are available in the region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#availability-zones-describe) for your account.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ eksctl create cluster \
    --name cockroachdb \
    --nodegroup-name standard-workers \
    --node-type m5.xlarge \
    --nodes 3 \
    --nodes-min 1 \
    --nodes-max 4 \
    --node-ami auto
    ~~~

    This creates EKS instances and joins them into a single Kubernetes cluster named `cockroachdb`. The `--node-type` flag tells the node pool to use the [`m5.xlarge`](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) instance type (4 vCPUs, 16 GB memory), which meets our [recommended CPU and memory configuration](recommended-production-settings.html#basic-hardware-recommendations).

    Cluster provisioning usually takes between 10 and 15 minutes. Do not move on to the next step until you see a message like `[âœ”]  EKS cluster "cockroachdb" in "us-east-1" region is ready` and details about your cluster.

3. Open the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) to verify that the stacks `eksctl-cockroachdb-cluster` and `eksctl-cockroachdb-nodegroup-standard-workers` were successfully created. Be sure that your region is selected in the console.
