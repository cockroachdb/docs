When the [`autocommit_before_ddl` session setting]({% link {{page.version.version}}/set-vars.md %}#autocommit-before-ddl) is set to `on`, any schema change statement that is sent during an [explicit transaction]({% link {{page.version.version}}/transactions.md %}) will cause the transaction to [commit]({% link {{page.version.version}}/commit-transaction.md %}) before executing the schema change.
