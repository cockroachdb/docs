The [configuration profile](#start-the-standby-cluster) included at startup creates the `template` virtual cluster with the same set of _capabilities_ per CockroachDB version. When you start a replication stream, you can specify the `template` VC with `LIKE` to ensure other virtual clusters on the standby cluster will work in the same way. Refer to [Step 4: Start replication](#step-4-start-replication) for syntax details.
