- The system virtual cluster manages the cluster's control plane and the replication of the cluster's data. Admins connect to the system virtual cluster to configure and manage the underlying CockroachDB cluster, set up physical cluster replication, create and manage a virtual cluster, and observe metrics and logs for the CockroachDB cluster and each virtual cluster.
- Each other virtual cluster manages its own data plane. Users connect to a virtual cluster by default, rather than the system virtual cluster. To connect to the system virtual cluster, the connection string must be modified. Virtual clusters contain user data and run application workloads. When physical cluster replication is enabled, the non-system virtual cluster on both primary and secondary clusters is named `main`.
