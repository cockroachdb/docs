When you [cut back]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cutover-replication.md %}#cut-back-to-the-primary-cluster) to a cluster that was previously the primary cluster, you should cut over to the `LATEST` timestamp. Using a [historical timestamp]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/as-of-system-time.md %}) may lead to the cutback failing. {% if page.name == "cutover-replication.md" %} Refer to the [PCR known limitations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-overview.md %}#known-limitations).{% endif %}
