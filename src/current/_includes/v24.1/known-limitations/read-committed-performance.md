- Because locks acquired by [foreign key]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/foreign-key.md %}) checks, [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}), and [`SELECT FOR SHARE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) are fully replicated under `READ COMMITTED` isolation, some queries experience a delay for Raft replication.
- [Foreign key]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/foreign-key.md %}) checks are not performed in parallel under `READ COMMITTED` isolation.
- [`SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) statements are less optimized under `READ COMMITTED` isolation than under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation. Under `READ COMMITTED` isolation, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE` usually perform an extra lookup join for every locked table when compared to the same queries under `SERIALIZABLE`. In addition, some optimization steps (such as de-correlation of correlated [subqueries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/subqueries.md %})) are not currently performed on these queries.
