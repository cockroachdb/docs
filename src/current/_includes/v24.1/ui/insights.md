## Workload Insights tab

The **Workload Insights** tab displays insights related to [transaction]({{ link_prefix }}transactions.html) and [statement]({{ link_prefix }}show-statements.html) executions.

### Transaction Executions view

{% if page.cloud != true -%}
To display this view, click **Insights** in the left-hand navigation of the DB Console and select **Workload Insights > Transaction Executions**.
{% endif -%}
{% if page.cloud == true -%}

To display this view, click **Insights** in the left-hand navigation of the Cloud Console and select **Workload Insights > Transaction Executions**.
{% endif -%}

The **Transaction Executions** view provides an overview of all [transaction executions]({{ link_prefix }}transactions.html) that have been flagged with insights.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The rows in this page are populated from the [`crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events`]({{ link_prefix }}crdb-internal.html#transaction_contention_events) and  `crdb_internal.cluster_txn_execution_insights` tables.

- The results displayed in the **Transaction Executions** view will be available as long as a corresponding row in the `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` or `crdb_internal.cluster_txn_execution_insights` tables exists. The rows in `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` on each node must use less space than `sql.contention.event_store.capacity`, and the rows in `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` cannot exceed `sql.insights.execution_insights_capacity`.
- The default tracing behavior captures a small percent of transactions so not all contention events will be recorded. When investigating [transaction contention]({{ link_prefix }}performance-best-practices-overview.html#transaction-contention), you can set the [`sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold` cluster setting]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-trace-txn-enable-threshold) to always capture contention events.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Workload Insight types

The Workload Insights tab surfaces the following type of insights:

- [Failed Execution](#failed-execution)
- [High Contention](#high-contention)
- [High Retry Count](#high-retry-count)
- [Slow Execution](#slow-execution)
- [Suboptimal Plan](#suboptimal-plan)

### Failed Execution

The transaction or statement execution failed. The following screenshot shows a failed transaction execution:

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/transaction_executions_failed.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Failed transaction execution" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

The following screenshot shows the default details of the preceding failed transaction execution.

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/transaction_execution_details_failed.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Failed transaction execution details" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

The **Insights** column shows the name of the insight, in this case **Failed Execution**. The **Details** column provides the **Error Code** and **Error Message**. CockroachDB uses [PostgreSQL Error Codes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html). In this example, Error Code `40001` is a `serialization_failure`.

#### Serialization conflict due to transaction contention

The following screenshot shows the conditional details of the preceding failed transaction execution. In this case, there was a *serialization conflict*, also known as an *isolation conflict*, due to [transaction contention]({{ link_prefix }}performance-recipes.html#transaction-contention). (For transaction contention that causes *lock contention*, see [High Contention](#high-contention)).

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/transaction_execution_details_failed_conditional.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Failed transaction execution details conditional" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

To capture more information in the event of a failed transaction execution due to a serialization conflict, set the `sql.contention.record_serialization_conflicts.enabled` [cluster setting]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html) to `true` (default is `false`). With this setting enabled, when the **Error Code** is `40001` and the **Error Message** specifically has [`RETRY_SERIALIZABLE - failed preemptive refresh`]({{ link_prefix }}transaction-retry-error-reference.html#failed_preemptive_refresh)` due to conflicting locks`, a conditional **Failed Execution** section is displayed with **Conflicting Transaction** and **Conflicting Location** information.

To troubleshoot, refer to the performance tuning recipe for [transaction retry errors]({{ link_prefix }}performance-recipes.html#transaction-retry-error).

### High Contention 

The transaction or statement execution experienced high [contention]({{ link_prefix }}performance-recipes.html#transaction-contention) time according to the threshold set in the [`sql.insights.latency_threshold` cluster setting]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-latency-threshold). This type of contention is also known as *lock contention*. (For transaction contention that causes *serialization conflict*, see [serialization conflict due to transaction contention](#serialization-conflict-due-to-transaction-contention).) 

To troubleshoot, refer to the performance tuning recipe for [identifying and unblocking a waiting transaction]({{ link_prefix }}performance-recipes.html#waiting-transaction).

The following screenshot shows the execution of a transaction flagged with **High Contention**:

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/transaction_execution.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Transaction execution" style="border:1px solid #eeqe;max-width:100%" />

The following screenshot shows the execution details of the preceding transaction execution:

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/transaction_execution_details.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Transaction execution details" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

### High Retry Count

The statement execution experienced a high number of [retries]({{ link_prefix }}transactions.html#automatic-retries) according to the threshold set in the [`sql.insights.high_retry_count.threshold` cluster setting]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-high-retry-count-threshold).

### Slow Execution

The statement (or a statement in the transaction) experienced slow execution. Depending on the settings in [Configuration](#configuration), either of the following conditions trigger this insight:

- Execution time is greater than the value of the [`sql.insights.latency_threshold` cluster setting]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-latency-threshold).
- Anomaly detection is enabled (`sql.insights.anomaly_detection.enabled`), execution time is greater than the value of `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold`, and [execution latency]({{ link_prefix }}ui-sql-dashboard.html#kv-execution-latency-99th-percentile) is greater than the p99 latency and more than double the median latency. For details, see [Detect slow executions](#detect-slow-executions).

### Suboptimal Plan

The plan could be improved for some statement(s) in the transaction execution. Possible causes include outdated statistics and missing indexes.

The statement execution has resulted in one or more [index recommendations](#schema-insights-tab) that would improve the plan.

The following screenshot shows the statement execution of the query described in [Use the right index]({{ link_prefix }}apply-statement-performance-rules.html#rule-2-use-the-right-index):

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/statement_executions.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Statement execution" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

The following screenshot shows the execution details of the preceding statement execution:

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/statement_execution_details.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Statement execution details" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

The **Insights** column shows the name of the insight, in this case **Suboptimal Plan**. The **Details** column provides details on the insight, such as a **Description** with the cause of the suboptimal plan and a **Recommendation** with a `CREATE INDEX` statement. The final column contains a **Create Index** button. Click the **Create Index** button to execute the recommended statement to mitigate the cause of the insight.

## Schema Insights tab

{% if page.cloud != true -%}
To display this view, click **Insights** in the left-hand navigation of the DB Console and select  **Schema Insights**.
{% endif -%}
{% if page.cloud == true -%}
To display this view, click **Insights** in the left-hand navigation of the Cloud Console  and select **Schema Insights**.
{% endif -%}

This view lists the [indexes]({{ link_prefix }}indexes.html) that have not been used and should be dropped, and/or the ones that should be created, altered, or replaced (based on statement execution).

- The drop recommendations are the same as those on the [**Databases**]({{ link_prefix }}ui-databases-page.html#index-recommendations) page.
- The create, alter, and replace recommendations are the same as those on the [Explain Plans tab]({{ link_prefix }}ui-statements-page.html#insights) on the Statements page. Whereas the **Explain Plans** tab shows all recommendations, the **Schema Insights** view shows only the latest recommendations for that statement fingerprint. If you execute a statement again after creating or updating an index, the recommendation disappears.

The following screenshot shows the insight that displays after you run the query described in [Use the right index]({{ link_prefix }}apply-statement-performance-rules.html#rule-2-use-the-right-index) 6 or more times:

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/schema_insight.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Schema insight" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

CockroachDB uses the threshold of 6 executions before offering an insight because it assumes that you are no longer merely experimenting with a query at that point.

- **Insights:** Contains one of the following insight types: **Create Index**, **Alter Index**, **Replace Index**, **Drop Unused Index**.
- **Details:** Details for each insight. Different insight types display different details fields:

    - **Create Index**, **Alter Index**, or **Replace Index**: A **Statement Fingerprint** field displays the statement fingerprint that would be optimized with the creation, alteration, or replacement of the index; and a **Recommendation** field displays the SQL query to create, alter, or replace the index.
    - **Drop Unused Index**: An **Index** field displays the name of the index to drop; and a **Description** field displays the reason for dropping the index.

[Admin users]({{ link_prefix }}security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role) will see an action button in the final column, which will execute the SQL statement suggested by the schema insight, for example "Create Index". Upon clicking the action button, a confirmation dialog displays a warning about the cost of [online schema changes]({{ link_prefix }}online-schema-changes.html) and the option to copy the SQL statement for later execution in a SQL client.

## Search and filter

By default, the Workload Insights view shows all statements or transactions that have insights. By default, the Schema Insights view shows all Schema Insights.

### Search

To search using the search field:

1. Enter a string in the search box at the top of the tab. To search for exact terms in order, wrap the search string in quotes.
1. Press `Enter`.

    The list is filtered by the string.

### Time interval

In the Workload Insights view, to see transactions or statement executions within a specific time interval, select a time interval from the selector at the top of the tab. The time interval field supports preset time intervals (1 Hour, 6 Hours, 1 Day, etc.) and custom time intervals. To select a custom time interval, click the time interval field and select **Custom time interval**. In the **Start (UTC)** and **End (UTC)** fields select or type a date and time.

Use the arrow buttons to cycle through previous and next time intervals. To select the most recent interval, click **Now**. When you select a time interval, the same interval is selected in the [Metrics]({{ link_prefix }}ui-overview.html#metrics) page.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
It's possible to select an interval for which no workload insights exist.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Filter

To filter the results on the **Workload Insights** or **Schema Insights** view:

1. Click the **Filters** field.
      - To filter by [application]({{ link_prefix }}connection-parameters.html#additional-connection-parameters), select **Application Name** and select one or more applications.

          - Queries from the SQL shell are displayed under the `$ cockroach` app.
          - If you haven't set `application_name` in a client connection string, it appears as `unset`.
      - To filter by one or more insight types, select **Workload Insight Type** or **Schema Insight Type** and select one or more types.
1. Click **Apply**

#### Detect slow executions

There are two different methods for detecting slow executions. By default, they are both enabled and you can configure them based on your workload.

The first method flags all executions running longer than [`sql.insights.latency_threshold`]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-latency-threshold). This is analogous to checking the [slow query log]({{ link_prefix }}logging-use-cases.html#sql_perf).

The second method attempts to detect **unusually slow executions**. You can enable this detection with [`sql.insights.anomaly_detection.enabled`]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-anomaly-detection-enabled) and configure it with [`sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold`]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-anomaly-detection-latency-threshold).
CockroachDB will then keep a streaming histogram in memory for each distinct statement fingerprint that has seen an execution latency longer than `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold`, and will flag any execution with a latency in the 99th percentile (greater than p99) for its fingerprint.

Additional controls filter out executions that are less actionable:

- The execution's latency must also be longer than twice the median latency (`> 2*p50`) for that fingerprint. This ensures that the elevated latency is significant enough to warrant attention.
- The execution's latency must also be longer than `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold`. Some executions are slower than usual, but are still fast enough for the workload.

The [`sql.insights.anomaly_detection.memory_limit` cluster setting]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-insights-anomaly-detection-memory-limit) cluster setting limits the amount of memory available for tracking these streaming latency histograms. When this threshold is surpassed, the least-recently touched histogram is evicted. The default setting is sufficient for tracking about 1,000 fingerprints.

You can track the `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.memory` and `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.evictions` [metrics]({{ link_prefix }}ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html) to determine if the settings are appropriate for your workload. If you see a steady stream of evictions or churn, you can either raise the `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.memory_limit` cluster setting, to allow for more storage; or raise the `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold` cluster setting, to examine fewer statement fingerprints.

### Schema insights settings

You can configure the index recommendations in the [**Schema Insights** tab](#schema-insights-tab), [**Explain Plans** tab]({{ link_prefix }}ui-statements-page.html#insights), and [**Databases** page]({{ link_prefix }}ui-databases-page.html) with the following [cluster settings]({{ link_prefix }}cluster-settings.html):
