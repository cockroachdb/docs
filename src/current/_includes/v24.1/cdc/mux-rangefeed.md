`MuxRangefeed` is a subsystem that improves the performance of rangefeeds with scale. It significantly reduces the overhead of running rangefeeds. Without `MuxRangefeed` enabled the number of RPC streams is proportional with the number of ranges in a table. For example, a large table could have tens of thousands of ranges. With `MuxRangefeed` enabled, this proportion improves so that the number of RPC streams is relative to the number of nodes in a cluster.

{% include_cached new-in.html version="v24.1" %} `MuxRangefeed` is enabled by default. Changefeeds created on clusters running v24.1 or later will automatically use the `MuxRangefeed` subsystem. If you have running changefeeds created in an earlier version of CockroachDB and upgrade to v24.1+, `MuxRangefeed` will not apply to these changefeeds. Once you have [upgraded](../v24.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) to v24.1, we recommend [pausing]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md %}#configuring-all-changefeeds) and then resuming existing changefeeds to ensure all changefeeds benefit from the performance improvements of `MuxRangefeed`.
