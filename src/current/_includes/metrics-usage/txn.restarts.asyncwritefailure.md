This metric is one measure of the impact of contention conflicts on workload performance. For guidance on contention conflicts, review [transaction contention best practices]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention) and [performance tuning recipes]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/performance-recipes.md %}#transaction-contention). Tens of restarts per minute may be a high value, a signal of an elevated degree of contention in the workload, which should be investigated. For the specific error, refer to the [transaction retry error reference]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}) for more details.
