This metric is one measure of the impact of contention conflicts on workload performance. For guidance on contention conflicts, review <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/performance-best-practices-overview#transaction-contention">transaction contention best practices</a> and <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/performance-recipes#transaction-contention">performance tuning recipes</a>. Tens of restarts per minute may be a high value, a signal of an elevated degree of contention in the workload, which should be investigated. For the specific error, refer to the <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transaction-retry-error-reference">transaction retry error reference</a> for more details.
