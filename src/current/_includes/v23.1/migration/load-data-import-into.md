Use [`IMPORT INTO`](import-into.html) to migrate [CSV](migrate-from-csv.html) or [Avro](migrate-from-avro.html) data stored via [userfile](use-userfile-storage.html) or [cloud storage](use-cloud-storage.html) into pre-existing tables on CockroachDB. This option is the most straightforward and achieves the highest throughput, but requires taking the tables **offline** to achieve its import speed. This shouldn't be a problem, since your application is not accessing these tables at this stage.
