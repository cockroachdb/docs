Changefeed types are not fully integrated with [user-defined composite types](create-type.html). Running changefeeds with user-defined composite types is in [Preview](cockroachdb-feature-availability.html#feature-availability-phases). Certain changefeed types do not support user-defined composite types. Refer to the change data capture [Known Limitations](change-data-capture-overview.html#known-limitations) for more detail.
