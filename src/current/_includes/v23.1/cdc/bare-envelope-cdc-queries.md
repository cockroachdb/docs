{% if page.name == "cdc-queries.md" %}CDC queries{% else %}[CDC queries](cdc-queries.html){% endif %} use [`envelope=bare`](create-changefeed.html#envelope) message format by default. The `bare` message envelope places the output of the `SELECT` clause at the top level of the message instead of under an `"after"` key. When there is additional information that the changefeed is sending, such as [`updated`](create-changefeed.html#updated-option) or [`resolved`](create-changefeed.html#resolved-option) timestamps, the messages will include a `crdb` field containing this information.
