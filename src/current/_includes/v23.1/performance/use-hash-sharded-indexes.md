We [discourage indexing on sequential keys](indexes.html#indexing-columns) for performance reasons. If a table **must** be indexed on sequential keys, use [hash-sharded indexes](indexes.html#hash-sharded-indexes). Hash-sharded indexes distribute sequential traffic uniformly across ranges, eliminating single-range [hot spots](performance-best-practices-overview.html#hot-spots) and improving write performance on sequentially-keyed indexes at a small cost to read performance.
