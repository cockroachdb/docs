- Multi-region topology patterns are almost always table-specific. If you haven't already, [review the full range of patterns]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/topology-patterns.md %}#multi-region) to ensure you choose the right one for each of your tables.
- Review how data is replicated and distributed across a cluster, and how this affects performance. It is especially important to understand the concept of the "leaseholder". For a summary, see [Reads and Writes in CockroachDB]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/reads-and-writes-overview.md %}). For a deeper dive, see the CockroachDB [Architecture Overview]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/overview.md %}).
- Review the concept of [locality]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start.md %}#locality), which CockroachDB uses to place and balance data based on how you define [replication controls]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}).
- Review the recommendations and requirements in our [Production Checklist]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/recommended-production-settings.md %}).
- This topology doesn't account for hardware specifications, so be sure to follow our [hardware recommendations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/recommended-production-settings.md %}#hardware) and perform a POC to size hardware for your use case. For optimal cluster performance, Cockroach Labs recommends that all nodes use the same hardware and operating system.
- Adopt relevant [SQL Best Practices]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}) to ensure optimal performance.
