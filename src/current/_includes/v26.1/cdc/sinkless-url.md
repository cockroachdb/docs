Sinkless changefeeds return results differently than other SQL statements, which means that they require a dedicated database connection with specific settings around result buffering. In normal operation, CockroachDB improves performance by buffering results server-side before returning them to a client; however, result buffering is automatically turned off for sinkless changefeeds. Also, sinkless changefeeds have different cancellation behavior than other queries: they can only be canceled by closing the underlying connection or issuing a  [`CANCEL QUERY`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cancel-query.md %}) statement on a separate connection. Combined, these attributes of changefeeds mean that applications should explicitly create dedicated connections to consume changefeed data, instead of using a connection pool as most client drivers do by default.
