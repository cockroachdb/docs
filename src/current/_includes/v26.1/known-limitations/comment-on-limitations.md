- The [`COMMENT ON`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/comment-on.md %}) statement associates comments to databases, tables, or columns. However, the internal table (`system.comments`) in which these comments are stored is not captured by a [`BACKUP`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/backup.md %}) of an individual table or database. As a workaround, take a cluster backup instead, as the `system.comments` table is included in cluster backups. [#44396](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/44396)
