- When setting the `default_int_size` [session variable]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-vars.md %}) in a batch of statements such as `SET default_int_size='int4'; SELECT 1::INT`, the `default_int_size` variable will not take effect until the next statement. Statement parsing is asynchronous with statement execution. As a workaround, set `default_int_size` via your database driver, or ensure that `SET default_int_size` is in its own statement.
