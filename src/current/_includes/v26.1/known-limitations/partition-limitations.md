- When defining a [table partition]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/partitioning.md %}), either during table creation or table alteration, it is not possible to use placeholders in the `PARTITION BY` clause.
- CockroachDB does not currently support dropping a single partition from a table. In order to remove partitions, you can [repartition]({% unless page.name == "partitioning.md" %}{% link {{ page.version.version }}/partitioning.md %}{% endunless %}#repartition-a-table) the table.
- In cases where the partition definition includes a comparison with `NULL` and a query constraint, incorrect query plans are returned. However, this case uses non-standard partitioning which defines partitions which could never hold values, so it is not likely to occur in production environments.
