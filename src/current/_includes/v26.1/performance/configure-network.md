CockroachDB requires TCP communication on two ports:

- **26257** (`tcp:26257`) for inter-node communication (i.e., working as a cluster)
- **8080** (`tcp:8080`) for accessing the DB Console

Since GCE instances communicate on their internal IP addresses by default, you do not need to take any action to enable inter-node communication. However, to access the DB Console from your local network, you must [create a firewall rule for your project](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls):

Field | Recommended Value
------|------------------
Name | **cockroachweb**
Source filter | IP ranges
Source IP ranges | Your local network's IP ranges
Allowed protocols | **tcp:8080**
Target tags | `cockroachdb`

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The **tag** feature will let you easily apply the rule to your instances.
