- By default, CockroachDB orders `NULL`s before all other values. For compatibility with PostgreSQL, the `null_ordered_last` [session variable]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-vars.md %}) was added, which changes the default to order `NULL` values after all other values. This works in most cases, due to some transformations CockroachDB makes in the optimizer to add extra ordering columns. However, it does not work when the ordering column is a tuple.
