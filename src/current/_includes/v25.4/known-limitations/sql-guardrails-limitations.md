- The `transaction_rows_read_err` and `transaction_rows_written_err` [session settings]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-vars.md %}) limit the number of rows read or written by a single [transaction]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}#limit-the-number-of-rows-written-or-read-in-a-transaction). These session settings will fail the transaction with an error, but not until the current query finishes executing and the results have been returned to the client.

- The `sql.guardrails.max_row_size_err` [cluster setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cluster-settings.md %}) misses large rows caused by indexed virtual computed columns. This is because the guardrail only checks the size of primary key rows, not secondary index rows. [#69540](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/69540)
