Clusters that mix `s390x` with other CPU architectures are unsupported for geospatial workloads. Due to differences in how trigonometric functions are computed on `s390x` systems, geospatial queries in heterogeneous clusters with `s390x` are likely to get incorrect results. This can include taking a backup on one architecture and restoring it on another. [#148783](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/148783)
