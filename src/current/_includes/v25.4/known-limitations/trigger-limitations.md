- A [trigger function]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/triggers.md %}#trigger-function) that is used in an existing trigger cannot be replaced with `CREATE OR REPLACE` syntax. To use `CREATE OR REPLACE`, first [drop any triggers]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/drop-trigger.md %}) that are using the function. [#134555](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/134555)
- Hidden columns are not visible to triggers. [#133331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/133331)
- The `REFERENCING` clause for `CREATE TRIGGER` is not supported. [#135655](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/135655)
- CockroachDB uses one-based indexing for the `TG_ARGV` array to maintain consistency with its array indexing system. This differs from PostgreSQL, where `TG_ARGV` uses zero-based indexing, unlike other PostgreSQL arrays. Trigger functions that reference `TG_ARGV` need to be adjusted when migrating from PostgreSQL. [#135311](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/135311)
- `UPDATE` triggers with a column list (using `UPDATE OF column_name` syntax) are not supported. [#135656](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/135656)
- Statement-level triggers for `TRUNCATE` events are not supported. [#135657](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/135657)
