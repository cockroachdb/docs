- CockroachDB imposes a hard limit of 16MiB on the data input for a single statement passed to CockroachDB from a client (including the SQL shell). We do not recommend attempting to execute statements from clients with large input.
- In the [built-in SQL shell]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}), using the [`\|`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}#commands) operator to perform a large number of inputs from a file can cause the server to close the connection. This is because `\|` sends the entire file as a single query to the server, which can exceed the upper bound on the size of a packet the server can accept from any client (16MB). As a workaround, [execute the file from the command line]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}#execute-sql-statements-from-a-file) with `cat data.sql | cockroach sql` instead of from within the interactive shell.
