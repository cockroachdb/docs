Attempts to apply the write in a similar way to a user-run query, which would re-run all constraint validations relevant to the destination table(s). If the change violates foreign key dependencies, unique constraints, or other constraints, the row will be put in the [dead letter queue (DLQ)]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/manage-logical-data-replication.md %}#dead-letter-queue-dlq) instead. Like the [SQL layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}), `validated` mode does not recognize deletion tombstones. As a result, an update to the same key from cluster A will successfully apply on cluster B, even if that key was deleted on cluster B before the LDR job streamed the cluster A update to the key.
