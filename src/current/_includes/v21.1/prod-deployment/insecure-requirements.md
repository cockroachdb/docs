- You must have [SSH access]({{page.ssh-link}}) to each machine. This is necessary for distributing and starting CockroachDB binaries.

- Your network configuration must allow TCP communication on the following ports:
	- `26257` for intra-cluster and client-cluster communication
	- `8080` to expose your DB Console

- Carefully review the [Production Checklist](recommended-production-settings.html) and recommended [Topology Patterns](topology-patterns.html).
