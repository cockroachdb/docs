CockroachDB replicates and distributes data for you behind-the-scenes and uses a [Gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol) to enable each node to locate data across the cluster.

To test this, use the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) locally as follows:

1. On your local machine, launch the built-in SQL client, with the `--host` flag set to the address of any node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ shell
  	$ cockroach sql --insecure --host=<address of any node>
  	~~~

2. Create an `insecurenodetest` database:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ sql
  	> CREATE DATABASE insecurenodetest;
  	~~~

3. Use `\q` or `ctrl-d` to exit the SQL shell.

4. Launch the built-in SQL client, with the `--host` flag set to the address of a different node:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ shell
  	$ cockroach sql --insecure --host=<address of different node>
  	~~~

5. View the cluster's databases, which will include `insecurenodetest`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ sql
  	> SHOW DATABASES;
  	~~~

  	~~~
  	+--------------------+
  	|      Database      |
  	+--------------------+
  	| crdb_internal      |
  	| information_schema |
  	| insecurenodetest   |
  	| pg_catalog         |
  	| system             |
  	+--------------------+
  	(5 rows)
  	~~~

6. Use `\q` to exit the SQL shell.
