There are some tradeoffs between enabling one table per LDR job versus multiple tables in one LDR job. Multiple tables in one LDR job can be easier to operate. For example, if you pause and resume the single job, LDR will stop and resume for all the tables. However, the most granular level observability will be at the job level. One table in one LDR job will allow for table-level observability.
