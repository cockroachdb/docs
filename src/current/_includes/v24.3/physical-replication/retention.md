We do not recommend setting `RETENTION` much higher than the 24-hour default on the standby cluster. Accumulated data from an excessive [retention (failover) window]({{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-technical-overview.md#failover-and-promotion-process) could affect queries running on the standby cluster that is active following a [failover]({{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md).
