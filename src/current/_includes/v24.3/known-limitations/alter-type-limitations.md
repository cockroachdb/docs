- When running the [`ALTER TYPE`]({{ page.version.version }}/alter-type.md) statement, you can only reference a user-defined type from the database that contains the type.
- You can only [cancel]({{ page.version.version }}/cancel-job.md) `ALTER TYPE` [schema change jobs]({{ page.version.version }}/online-schema-changes.md) that drop values. This is because when you drop a value, CockroachDB searches through every row that could contain the type's value, which could take a long time. All other `ALTER TYPE` schema change jobs are [non-cancellable]({{ page.version.version }}/cancel-job.md#known-limitations).
