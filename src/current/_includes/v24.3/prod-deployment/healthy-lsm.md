**Expected values for a healthy cluster**: An IO Overload value greater than 1.0 generally indicates an overload in the Pebble LSM tree.

These files are not being compacted quickly enough to lower levels, resulting in a [misshapen LSM]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#inverted-lsms).
