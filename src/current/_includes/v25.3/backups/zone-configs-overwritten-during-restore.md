During a [cluster restore]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/restore.md %}#full-cluster), any [zone configurations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}) present on the destination cluster are **overwritten** with the zone configurations from the [backed-up cluster]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/backup.md %}#back-up-a-cluster). If no customized zone configurations were on the cluster when the backup was taken, then after the restore the destination cluster will use the zone configuration from the [`RANGE DEFAULT` configuration]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}#view-the-default-replication-zone).
