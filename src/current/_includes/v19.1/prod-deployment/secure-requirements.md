- Carefully review the [Production Checklist](recommended-production-settings.html) and recommended [Topology Patterns](topology-patterns.html).

- You must have [CockroachDB installed](install-cockroachdb.html) locally. This is necessary for generating and managing your deployment's certificates.

- You must have [SSH access]({{page.ssh-link}}) to each machine. This is necessary for distributing and starting CockroachDB binaries.

- Your network configuration must allow TCP communication on the following ports:
	- `26257` for intra-cluster and client-cluster communication
	- `8080` to expose your Admin UI
