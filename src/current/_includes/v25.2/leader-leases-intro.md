CockroachDB offers an improved leasing system rebuilt atop a stronger form of [Raft]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md %}#raft) leadership that ensures that the Raft leader is always the range's leaseholder, except briefly during [lease transfers]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md %}#how-leases-are-transferred-from-a-dead-node). This type of lease is called a _Leader lease_, and supersedes the former system of having different epoch-based and expiration-based lease types, while combining the performance of the former with the resilience of the latter.
