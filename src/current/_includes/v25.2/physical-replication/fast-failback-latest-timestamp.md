When you [fail back]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md %}#failback) to a cluster that was previously the primary cluster, you should fail over to the `LATEST` timestamp. Using a [historical timestamp]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/as-of-system-time.md %}) may lead to the failback failing. {% if page.name == "failover-replication.md" %} Refer to the [PCR known limitations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-overview.md %}#known-limitations).{% endif %}
