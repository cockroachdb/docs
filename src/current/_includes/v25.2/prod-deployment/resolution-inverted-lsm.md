If compaction has fallen behind and caused an [inverted LSM]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#inverted-lsms), throttle your workload concurrency to allow [compaction]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#compaction) to catch up and restore a healthy LSM shape. {% include {{ page.version.version }}/prod-deployment/prod-guidance-connection-pooling.md %} If a node is severely impacted, you can [start a new node]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start.md %}) and then [decommission the problematic node](node-shutdown.html?filters=decommission#remove-nodes). {% include {{page.version.version}}/storage/compaction-concurrency.md %}
