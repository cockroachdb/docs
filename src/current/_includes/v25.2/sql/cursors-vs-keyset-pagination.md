_Cursors_ are stateful objects that use more database resources than keyset pagination, since each cursor holds open a transaction. However, they are easier to use, and make it easier to get consistent results without having to write complex queries from your application logic. They do not require that the results be returned in a particular order (that is, you don't have to include an `ORDER BY` clause), which makes them more flexible.

_Keyset pagination_ queries are usually much faster than cursors since they order by indexed columns. However, in order to get that performance they require that you return results in some defined order that can be calculated by your application's queries. Because that ordering involves calculating the start/end point of pages of results based on an indexed key, they require more care to write correctly.
