Cockroach Labs recommends leaving the transaction priority at the default setting in almost all cases. Changing the transaction priority to `HIGH` in particular can lead to difficult-to-debug interactions with other transactions executing on the system.

If you are setting a transaction priority to avoid [contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention) or [hotspots]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}), or to [get better query performance]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/make-queries-fast.md %}), it is usually a sign that you need to update your [schema design]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/schema-design-database.md %}) and/or review the data access patterns of your workload.
