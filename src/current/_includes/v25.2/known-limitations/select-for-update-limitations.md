- `SKIP LOCKED` cannot be used for tables with multiple [column families]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/column-families.md %}). [#160961](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/160961)
- By default under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation, locks acquired using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` are implemented as fast, in-memory [unreplicated locks](architecture/transaction-layer.html#unreplicated-locks). If a [lease transfer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md %}#leases) or [range split/merge]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/distribution-layer.md %}#range-merges) occurs on a range held by an unreplicated lock, the lock is dropped. The following behaviors can occur:
    - The desired ordering of concurrent accesses to one or more rows of a table expressed by your use of `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` may not be preserved (that is, a transaction _B_ against some table _T_ that was supposed to wait behind another transaction _A_ operating on _T_ may not wait for transaction _A_).
    - The transaction that acquired the (now dropped) unreplicated lock may fail to commit, leading to [transaction retry errors with code `40001`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}) and the [`restart transaction` error message]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/common-errors.md %}#restart-transaction).

    When running under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation, `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` locks should be thought of as best-effort, and should not be relied upon for correctness. Note that [serialization]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-serializable.md %}) is preserved despite this limitation. This limitation is fixed when the `enable_durable_locking_for_serializable` [session setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/session-variables.md %}#enable-durable-locking-for-serializable) is set to `true`. This limitation does **not** apply to [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/read-committed.md %}) transactions.
