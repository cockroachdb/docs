Under certain conditions, such as when executing certain SQL functions, CockroachDB's row-level security (RLS) implementation exposes metadata about the number of restricted rows in a table. For example, when a user applies arbitrary SQL filters on a table with RLS enabled, it's possible for the user to see how many total rows are in the table; this count includes rows that the user does not have direct access to. This metadata leakage can also occur when statements like [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/explain.md %}) are used, as the output includes a count of the number of rows scanned by the query that can include the number of restricted rows, even though the rows themselves are not directly accessible.
