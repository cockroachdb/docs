- Schema changes (e.g., [`CREATE TABLE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-table.md %}), [`CREATE SCHEMA`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-schema.md %}), [`CREATE INDEX`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-index.md %})) cannot be performed within explicit `READ COMMITTED` transactions when the [`autocommit_before_ddl` session setting]({% link {{page.version.version}}/set-vars.md %}#autocommit-before-ddl) is set to `off`, and will cause transactions to abort. As a workaround, [set the transaction's isolation level]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/read-committed.md %}#set-the-current-transaction-to-read-committed) to `SERIALIZABLE`. [#114778](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/114778)
- Multi-column-family checks during updates are not supported under `READ COMMITTED` isolation. [#112488](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/112488)
- Because locks acquired by [foreign key]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/foreign-key.md %}) checks, [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}), and [`SELECT FOR SHARE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) are fully replicated under `READ COMMITTED` isolation, some queries experience a delay for Raft replication.
- [Foreign key]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/foreign-key.md %}) checks are not performed in parallel under `READ COMMITTED` isolation.
- [`SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) statements are less optimized under `READ COMMITTED` isolation than under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation. Under `READ COMMITTED` isolation, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE` usually perform an extra lookup join for every locked table when compared to the same queries under `SERIALIZABLE`. In addition, some optimization steps (such as de-correlation of correlated [subqueries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/subqueries.md %})) are not currently performed on these queries.
- Regardless of isolation level, [`SELECT FOR UPDATE` and `SELECT FOR SHARE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) statements in CockroachDB do not prevent insertion of new rows matching the search condition (i.e., [phantom reads]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/read-committed.md %}#non-repeatable-reads-and-phantom-reads)). This matches PostgreSQL behavior at all isolation levels. [#120673](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/120673)
