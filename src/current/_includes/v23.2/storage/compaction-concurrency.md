By default, the [storage engine]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}) uses a compaction concurrency of 3. If you have sufficient IOPS and CPU headroom, you can consider increasing this setting via the `COCKROACH_COMPACTION_CONCURRENCY` environment variable. This may help to reshape the LSM more quickly in [inverted LSM]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#inverted-lsms) scenarios; and it can lead to increased overall performance for some workloads. Cockroach Labs **strongly recommends** testing your workload against non-default values of this setting.
