Note that the [SQL engine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer) will avoid sending requests to nodes in other regions when it can instead read a value from a unique column that is stored locally. This capability is known as [_locality optimized search_](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ page.version.version }}/cost-based-optimizer#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters).
