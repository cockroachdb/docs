When you restore from an incremental backup, you're restoring the **entire** table, database, or cluster. CockroachDB uses both the latest (or a [specific]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/restore.md %}#restore-a-specific-full-or-incremental-backup)) incremental backup and the full backup during this process. You cannot restore an incremental backup without a full backup. Furthermore, it is not possible to restore over a [table]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/restore.md %}#tables), [database]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/restore.md %}#databases), or [cluster](restore.html#full-cluster) with existing data. Refer to [Restore types](restore.html#restore-types) for detail on the types of backups you can restore.
