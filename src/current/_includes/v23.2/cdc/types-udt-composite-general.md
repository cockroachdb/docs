Changefeed types are not fully integrated with [user-defined composite types]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-type.md %}). Running changefeeds with user-defined composite types is in [Preview]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroachdb-feature-availability.md %}#feature-availability-phases). Certain changefeed types do not support user-defined composite types. Refer to the change data capture [Known Limitations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md %}#known-limitations) for more detail.
