[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication uses credentials managed by a third-party provider (IdP) to authenticate with Kafka instead of requiring you to provide your Kafka cluster credentials directly in a [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md %}) statement. Your provider's authentication server will issue a temporary token, giving you flexibility to apply access rules on the credentials that your IdP provides.
