- The system virtual cluster manages the cluster's control plane and the replication of the application virtual cluster. Admins connect to the system virtual cluster to configure and manage the underlying storage cluster, set up physical cluster replication, create and manage virtual clusters, and observe metrics and logs for the storage cluster and each virtual cluster.
- The application virtual cluster manages its own data plane. Users connect to the application virtual cluster rather than the system virtual cluster by default, unless they modify the connection string to connect to the system virtual cluster. The application virtual cluster contains user data and runs application workloads. When physical cluster replication is enabled, the application virtual cluster on both primary and secondary clusters is named `application`.
