Physical cluster replication happens between an active primary cluster and a passive standby cluster that accepts updates from the primary cluster. The unit of replication is a virtual cluster, which is part of the underlying infrastructure in the primary and standby clusters. On each cluster is the system interface, that manages the replication stream, cluster settings, and configuration for the cluster.
