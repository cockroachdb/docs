- Physical cluster replication is supported only on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} in new v23.2 clusters. Physical Cluster Replication cannot be enabled on clusters that have been upgraded from a previous version of CockroachDB.
- Read queries are not supported on the standby cluster before [cutover]({{ page.version.version }}/cutover-replication.md).
- The primary and standby clusters must have the same [zone configurations]({{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md).
- Cutting back to the primary cluster after a cutover is a manual process. Refer to [Cut back to the primary cluster]({{ page.version.version }}/cutover-replication.md#cut-back-to-the-primary-cluster). In addition, after cutover, to continue using physical cluster replication, you must configure it again.
- Before cutover to the standby, the standby cluster does not support running [backups]({{ page.version.version }}/backup-and-restore-overview.md) or [changefeeds]({{ page.version.version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md).
- After a cutover, there is no mechanism to stop applications from connecting to the original primary cluster. It is necessary to redirect application traffic manually, such as by using a network load balancer or adjusting DNS records.
- Large data imports, such as those produced by [`RESTORE`]({{ page.version.version }}/restore.md) or [`IMPORT`]({{ page.version.version }}/import.md), may dramatically increase [replication lag]({{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-technical-overview.md#cutover-and-promotion-process).
