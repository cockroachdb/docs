- Physical cluster replication is supported only on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} in new v23.2 clusters and later. Physical Cluster Replication cannot be enabled on clusters that have been upgraded from a version of CockroachDB earlier than v23.2.
- Read queries are not supported on the standby cluster before [cutover]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cutover-replication.md %}).
- The primary and standby clusters must have the same [zone configurations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}).
- Before cutover to the standby, the standby cluster does not support running [backups]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}) or [changefeeds]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md %}).
- After a cutover, there is no mechanism to stop applications from connecting to the original primary cluster. It is necessary to redirect application traffic manually, such as by using a network load balancer or adjusting DNS records.
