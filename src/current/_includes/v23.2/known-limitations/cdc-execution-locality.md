In v23.2.0, changefeeds that use the [`execution_locality` option]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/changefeeds-in-multi-region-deployments.md %}#run-a-changefeed-job-by-locality) set to a [secondary region]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#secondary-regions) could create a plan that assigns most of the ranges to an [aggregator]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work.md %}) on the coordinator node. This leads to an unbalanced plan and slow changefeed progress, particularly when the table is large and has many ranges. This issue is [partially mitigated](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/commit/5d7714a03a891c9fd5746fb876c39dced4f47205) in v23.2.1 and later.
