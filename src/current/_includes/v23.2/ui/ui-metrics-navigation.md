Use the **Graph** menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a specific node.

To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a time interval selector allows you to filter the view for a predefined or custom time interval. Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current time interval. When you select a time interval, the same interval is selected in the [SQL Activity]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}#sql-activity) pages. However, if you select 10 or 30 minutes, the interval defaults to 1 hour in SQL Activity pages.

When viewing graphs, two perpendicular lines will appear at your mouse cursor providing further insight into the data. The metric values are displayed in the legend under the graph. Click anywhere within the graph to pin the values in place, decoupling the values from your mouse movements. Click anywhere within the graph to cause the values to change with your mouse movements once more.

Hovering your mouse cursor over the graph title will display a tooltip with a description and the [metrics]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md %} ) used to create the graph.
