These essential CockroachDB metrics enable you to build custom dashboards with the following tools:
{% if include.deployment == 'self-hosted' %}
* [Grafana]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.md %}#step-5-visualize-metrics-in-grafana)
* [Datadog Integration]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/datadog.md %}) - The [**Datadog Integration Metric Name**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cockroachdb/?tab=host#metrics) column lists the corresponding Datadog metric which requires the `cockroachdb.` prefix.
{% elsif include.deployment == 'dedicated' %}
* [Datadog integration]({% link cockroachcloud/tools-page.md %}#monitor-cockroachdb-dedicated-with-datadog) - The [**Datadog Integration Metric Name**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cockroachdb_dedicated/#metrics) column lists the corresponding Datadog metric which requires the `crdb_dedicated.` prefix.
* [Metrics export]({% link cockroachcloud/export-metrics.md %})
{% endif %}

The **Usage** column explains why each metric is important to visualize in a custom dashboard and how to make both practical and actionable use of the metric in a production deployment.

It characterizes the storage device's performance capability. All I/O performance metrics are Linux counters and correspond to the `avgqu-sz`  in the Linux `iostat` command output. You need to view the device queue graph in the context of the actual read/write IOPS and MBPS metrics that show the actual device utilization. If the device is not keeping up, the queue will grow. Values over 10 are bad. Values around 5 mean the device is working hard trying to keep up. For internal (on chassis) [NVMe](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express) devices, the queue values are typically 0. For network connected devices, such as [AWS EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html), the normal operating range of values is 1 to 2. Spikes in values are OK. They indicate an I/O spike where the device fell behind and then caught up. End users may experience inconsistent response times, but there should be no cluster stability issues. If the queue is greater than 5 for an extended period of time and IOPS or MBPS are low, then the storage is most likely not provisioned per Cockroach Labs guidance. In AWS EBS, it is commonly an EBS type, such as gp2, not suitable as database primary storage. If I/O is low and the queue is low, the most likely scenario is that the CPU is lacking and not driving I/O. One such case is a cluster with nodes with only 2 vcpus which is not supported [sizing]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/recommended-production-settings.md %}#sizing) for production deployments. There are quite a few background processes in the database that take CPU away from the workload, so the workload is just not getting the CPU. Review [storage and disk I/O]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/common-issues-to-monitor.md %}#storage-and-disk-i-o). |

In a well-configured environment, the actual clock skew would be in the sub-millisecond range. A skew exceeding 5 ms is likely due to a NTP service mis-configuration. Reducing the actual clock skew reduces the probability of uncertainty related conflicts and corresponding retires which has a positive impact on workload performance. Conversely, a larger actual clock skew increases the probability of retries due to uncertainty conflicts, with potentially measurable adverse effects on workload performance. |

## Changefeeds

If [changefeeds]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) are created in a CockroachDB cluster, monitor these additional metrics in your custom dashboards:

| <div style="width:225px">CockroachDB Metric Name</div> | {% if include.deployment == 'self-hosted' %}<div style="width:225px">[Datadog Integration Metric Name](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cockroachdb/?tab=host#metrics)<br>(add `cockroachdb.` prefix)</div> |{% elsif include.deployment == 'dedicated' %}<div style="width:225px">[Datadog Integration Metric Name](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cockroachdb_dedicated/#metrics)<br>(add `crdb_dedicated.` prefix)</div> |{% endif %}<div style="width:150px">Description</div>| Usage |

| jobs.changefeed.currently_paused  | {% if include.deployment == 'self-hosted' %}jobs.changefeed.currently_paused |{% elsif include.deployment == 'dedicated' %}NOT AVAILABLE |{% endif %} Number of changefeed jobs currently considered Paused        | Monitor and alert on this metric to safeguard against an inadvertent operational error of leaving a changefeed job in a paused state for an extended period of time. Changefeed jobs should not be paused for a long time because the [protected timestamp prevents garbage collection]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md %}#protected-timestamp-and-garbage-collection-monitoring). |
| changefeed.failures               | changefeed.failures                                        | Total number of changefeed jobs which have failed            | This metric tracks the permanent changefeed job failures that the jobs system will not try to restart. Any increase in this counter should be investigated. An alert on this metric is recommended. |
| changefeed.error_retries          | changefeed.error.retries                                   | Total retryable errors encountered by all changefeeds        | This metric tracks transient changefeed errors.  Alert on "too many" errors, such as 50 retries in 15 minutes. For example, during a rolling upgrade this counter will increase because the changefeed jobs will restart following node restarts. There is an exponential backoff, up to 10 minutes. But if there is no rolling upgrade in process or other cluster maintenance, and the error rate is high, investigate the changefeed job.
| changefeed.emitted_messages       | changefeed.emitted.messages                                | Messages emitted by all feeds                                | This metric provides a useful context when assessing the state of changefeeds. This metric characterizes the rate of changes being streamed from the CockroachDB cluster. |
| changefeed.emitted_bytes          | {% if include.deployment == 'self-hosted' %}changefeed.emitted_bytes.count |{% elsif include.deployment == 'dedicated' %}NOT AVAILABLE |{% endif %} Bytes emitted by all feeds                                   | This metric provides a useful context when assessing the state of changefeeds. This metric characterizes the throughput bytes being streamed from the CockroachDB cluster. |
| changefeed.commit_latency         | changefeed.commit.latency                                  | The difference between the event MVCC timestamp and the time it was acknowledged by the downstream sink. If the sink batches events, then the difference between the oldest event in the batch and acknowledgement is recorded. Latency during  backfill is excluded.| This metric provides a useful context when assessing the state of changefeeds. This metric characterizes the end-to-end lag between a committed change and that change applied at the destination. |
| jobs.changefeed.protected_age_sec | {% if include.deployment == 'self-hosted' %}jobs.changefeed.protected_age_sec |{% elsif include.deployment == 'dedicated' %}NOT AVAILABLE |{% endif %} The age of the oldest PTS record protected by changefeed jobs | [Changefeeds use protected timestamps to protect the data from being garbage collected]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md %}#protected-timestamp-and-garbage-collection-monitoring). Ensure the protected timestamp age does not significantly exceed the [GC TTL zone configuration]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}#replication-zone-variables). Alert on this metric if the protected timestamp age is greater than 3 times the GC TTL. |

## Row-Level TTL

If [Row-Level TTL]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/row-level-ttl.md %}) is configured for any table in a CockroachDB cluster, monitor these additional metrics in your custom dashboards:
