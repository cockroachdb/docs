For performance reasons, we [discourage indexing on sequential keys](indexes.html#indexing-columns). If, however, you are working with a table that must be indexed on sequential keys, you should use [hash-sharded indexes](indexes.html#hash-sharded-indexes). Hash-sharded indexes distribute sequential traffic uniformly across ranges, eliminating single-range hotspots and improving write performance on sequentially-keyed indexes at a small cost to read performance.
