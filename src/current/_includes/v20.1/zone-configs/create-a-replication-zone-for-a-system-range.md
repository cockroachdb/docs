In addition to the databases and tables that are visible via the SQL interface, CockroachDB stores internal data in what are called system ranges. CockroachDB comes with pre-configured replication zones for some of these ranges:

Target Name | Description
----------|-----------------------------
`meta` | The "meta" ranges contain the authoritative information about the location of all data in the cluster.<br><br>These ranges must retain a majority of replicas for the cluster as a whole to remain available and historical queries are never run on them, so CockroachDB comes with a **pre-configured** `meta` replication zone with `num_replicas` set to 5 to make these ranges more resilient to node failure and a lower-than-default `gc.ttlseconds` to keep these ranges smaller for reliable performance.<br><br>If your cluster is running in multiple datacenters, it's a best practice to configure the meta ranges to have a copy in each datacenter.
`liveness` | The "liveness" range contains the authoritative information about which nodes are live at any given time.<br><br>These ranges must retain a majority of replicas for the cluster as a whole to remain available and historical queries are never run on them, so CockroachDB comes with a **pre-configured** `liveness` replication zone with `num_replicas` set to 5 to make these ranges more resilient to node failure and a lower-than-default `gc.ttlseconds` to keep these ranges smaller for reliable performance.
`system` | There are system ranges for a variety of other important internal data, including information needed to allocate new table IDs and track the status of a cluster's nodes.<br><br>These ranges must retain a majority of replicas for the cluster as a whole to remain available, so CockroachDB comes with a **pre-configured** `system` replication zone with `num_replicas` set to 5 to make these ranges more resilient to node failure.
`timeseries` | The "timeseries" ranges contain monitoring data about the cluster that powers the graphs in CockroachDB's Admin UI. If necessary, you can add a `timeseries` replication zone to control the replication of this data.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Use caution when editing replication zones for system ranges, as they could cause some (or all) parts of your cluster to stop working.

To control replication for one of the above sets of system ranges, use the [`ALTER RANGE ... CONFIGURE ZONE`](configure-zone.html) statement to define the relevant values (other values will be inherited from the parent zone):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER RANGE meta CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 7;
~~~

~~~
CONFIGURE ZONE 1
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR RANGE meta;
~~~

~~~
    target   |            raw_config_sql
+------------+---------------------------------------+
  RANGE meta | ALTER RANGE meta CONFIGURE ZONE USING
             |     range_min_bytes = 134217728,
             |     range_max_bytes = 536870912,
             |     gc.ttlseconds = 3600,
             |     num_replicas = 7,
             |     constraints = '[]',
             |     lease_preferences = '[]'
