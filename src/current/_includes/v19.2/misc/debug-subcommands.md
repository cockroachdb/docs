While the `cockroach debug` command has a few subcommands, users are expected to use only the [`zip`](cockroach-debug-zip.html), [`encryption-active-key`](cockroach-debug-encryption-active-key.html),  [`merge-logs`](cockroach-debug-merge-logs.html), and [`ballast`](cockroach-debug-ballast.html) subcommands.

The other `debug` subcommands are useful only to CockroachDB's developers and contributors.
