In the absence of [special replication constraints](configure-replication-zones.html), CockroachDB rebalances replicas to take advantage of available storage capacity. However, in a 3-node cluster with multiple stores per node, CockroachDB is **not** able to rebalance replicas from one store to another store on the same node because this would temporarily result in the node having multiple replicas of the same range, which is not allowed. This is due to the mechanics of rebalancing, where the cluster first creates a copy of the replica at the target destination before removing the source replica. To allow this type of cross-store rebalancing, the cluster must have 4 or more nodes; this allows the cluster to create a copy of the replica on a node that doesn't already have a replica of the range before removing the source replica and then migrating the new replica to the store with more capacity on the original node.
