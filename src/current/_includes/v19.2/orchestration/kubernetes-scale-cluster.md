Your Kubernetes cluster includes 3 worker nodes, or instances, that can run pods. A CockroachDB node runs in each pod. As recommended in our [production best practices](recommended-production-settings.html#topology), you should ensure that two pods are not placed on the same worker node. 


To do this, add a new worker node and then edit your StatefulSet configuration to add another pod for the new CockroachDB node.

1. Add a worker node, bringing the total from 3 to 4:
    - On GKE, [resize your cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/resizing-a-cluster).
    - On EKS, resize your [Worker Node Group](https://eksctl.io/usage/managing-nodegroups/#scaling).
    - On GCE, resize your [Managed Instance Group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/).
    - On AWS, resize your [Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/as-manual-scaling.html).

2. Add a pod for the new CockroachDB node:

    <section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="manual">
    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl scale statefulset cockroachdb --replicas=4
    ~~~

    ~~~
    statefulset.apps/cockroachdb scaled
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
    If you aren't using the Kubernetes CA to sign certificates, you can now skip to step 6.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}
    </section>

    <section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="helm">
    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ helm upgrade \
    my-release \
    cockroachdb/cockroachdb \
    --set statefulset.replicas=4 \
    --reuse-values
    ~~~

    ~~~
    Release "my-release" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
