CockroachDB requires moderate levels of clock synchronization to preserve data consistency. For this reason, when a node detects that its clock is out of sync with at least half of the other nodes in the cluster by 80% of the maximum offset allowed, it spontaneously shuts down. This offset defaults to 500ms but can be changed via the [`--max-offset`](cockroach-start.html#flags-max-offset) flag when starting each node.

While [serializable consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability) is maintained regardless of clock skew, skew outside the configured clock offset bounds can result in violations of single-key linearizability between causally dependent transactions. It's therefore important to prevent clocks from drifting too far by running [NTP](http://www.ntp.org/) or other clock synchronization software on each node.

The one rare case to note is when a node's clock suddenly jumps beyond the maximum offset before the node detects it. Although extremely unlikely, this could occur, for example, when running CockroachDB inside a VM and the VM hypervisor decides to migrate the VM to different hardware with a different time. In this case, there can be a small window of time between when the node's clock becomes unsynchronized and when the node spontaneously shuts down. During this window, it would be possible for a client to read stale data and write data derived from stale reads. To protect against this, we recommend using the `server.clock.forward_jump_check_enabled` and `server.clock.persist_upper_bound_interval` [cluster settings](cluster-settings.html).

### Considerations

When setting up clock synchronization:

- All nodes in the cluster must be synced to the same time source, or to different sources that implement leap second smearing in the same way. For example, Google and Amazon have time sources that are compatible with each other (they implement [leap second smearing](https://developers.google.com/time/smear) in the same way), but are incompatible with the default NTP pool (which does not implement leap second smearing).
- For nodes running in AWS, we recommend [Amazon Time Sync Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html#configure-amazon-time-service). For nodes running in GCP, we recommend [Google's internal NTP service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configure-ntp#configure_ntp_for_your_instances). For nodes running elsewhere, we recommend [Google Public NTP](https://developers.google.com/time/). Note that the Google and Amazon time services can be mixed with each other, but they cannot be mixed with other time services (unless you have verified leap second behavior). Either all of your nodes should use the Google and Amazon services, or none of them should.
- If you do not want to use the Google or Amazon time sources, you can use [`chrony`](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/index.html) and enable client-side leap smearing, unless the time source you're using already does server-side smearing. In most cases, we recommend the Google Public NTP time source because it handles smearing the leap second. If you use a different NTP time source that doesn't smear the leap second, you must configure client-side smearing manually and do so in the same way on each machine.
- Do not run more than one clock sync service on VMs where `cockroach` is running.
