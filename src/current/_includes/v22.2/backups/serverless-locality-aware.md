CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters operate with a [different architecture](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/architecture#cockroachdb-serverless) compared to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters. These architectural differences have implications for how locality-aware backups can run. Serverless clusters will scale resources depending on whether they are actively in use, which means that it is less likely to have a SQL pod available in every locality. As a result, your Serverless cluster may not have a SQL pod in the locality where the data resides, which can lead to the cluster uploading that data to a storage bucket in a locality where you do have active SQL pods. You should consider this as you plan a backup strategy that must comply with [data domiciling](data-domiciling.html) requirements.
