CockroachDB replicates and distributes data behind-the-scenes and uses a [Gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol) to enable each node to locate data across the cluster. Once a cluster is live, any node can be used as a SQL gateway.

When using a load balancer, you should issue commands directly to the load balancer, which then routes traffic to the nodes.

Use the [built-in SQL client](cockroach-sql.html) locally as follows:

1. On your local machine, launch the built-in SQL client, with the `--host` flag set to the address of the load balancer:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure --host=<address of load balancer>
    ~~~

1. Create an `insecurenodetest` database:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE insecurenodetest;
    ~~~

1. View the cluster's databases, which will include `insecurenodetest`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW DATABASES;
    ~~~

    ~~~
    +--------------------+
    |      Database      |
    +--------------------+
    | crdb_internal      |
    | information_schema |
    | insecurenodetest   |
    | pg_catalog         |
    | system             |
    +--------------------+
    (5 rows)
    ~~~

1. Use `\q` to exit the SQL shell.
