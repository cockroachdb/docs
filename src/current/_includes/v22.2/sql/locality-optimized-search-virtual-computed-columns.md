- {% if page.name == "cost-based-optimizer.md" %} Locality optimized search {% else %} [Locality optimized search](cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters) {% endif %} does not work for queries that use [partitioned unique indexes](partitioning.html#partition-using-a-secondary-index) on [virtual computed columns](computed-columns.html#virtual-computed-columns). A workaround for computed columns is to make the virtual computed column a [stored computed column](computed-columns.html#stored-computed-columns). Locality optimized search does not work for queries that use partitioned unique [expression indexes](expression-indexes.html).
