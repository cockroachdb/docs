CockroachDB supports two types of backups:

- **Managed backups**: Cockroach Labs takes automated backups of CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters that are stored in Cockroach Labs' cloud storage. {% if page.name != "managed-backups.md" %} Refer to [Managed Backups](managed-backups.md) to learn more about the type and frequency of backups supported for both CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters. {% else %}  {% endif %}
- {% if page.name == "take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md" %} **Self-managed backups**: {% else %} **[Self-managed backups](take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md)**: {% endif %} You can take manual backups and store them in your [cloud storage buckets]({{site.current_cloud_version}}/use-cloud-storage.md) using the [`BACKUP`]({{site.current_cloud_version}}/backup.md) statement. Self-managed backups are supported in CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }}, CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}, and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }}.
