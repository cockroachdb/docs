The best way to estimate your resource usage is to [set resource limits]({% link cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management.md %}#edit-your-resource-limits) you're comfortable with and run your workload. You can see the RUs and storage your cluster has used in the **Usage this month** section of the [**Cluster Overview**]({% link cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management.md %}#view-cluster-overview) page. Once enough usage data is available, you can also see a graph of your monthly resource usage and recommended spend limit on the [**Edit cluster**]({% link cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management.md %}#edit-your-resource-limits) page.

A typical `SELECT` query consumes between 1 and 15 RUs, depending on the amount of data it scans and returns. A typical `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement consumes between 10 and 25 RUs, depending on the amount of data it inserts or updates. To estimate the RU consumption of individual SQL statements, you can use the [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/explain-analyze) SQL statement. For an example, see [Example Request Unit calculation]({% link cockroachcloud/optimize-serverless-workload.md %}#example-request-unit-calculation).
