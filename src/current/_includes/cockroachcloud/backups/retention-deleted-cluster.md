Once a cluster is deleted, Cockroach Labs retains the backups for the {% if page.name == "managed-backups.md" %} configured retention time. {% else %} [configured retention time]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}#managed-backup-settings). {% endif %} The retained backups are not available for restore using the Cloud Console. If an [organization]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-access.md %}#manage-your-organizations) is deleted, managed backups will be retained for a maximum of 30 days. If a backup's retention time was set to **less** than 30 days in {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters, the backup will be retained for the set retention time.

To restore a backup from a deleted cluster, you must contact the [Cockroach Labs Support team](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/support-resources).
