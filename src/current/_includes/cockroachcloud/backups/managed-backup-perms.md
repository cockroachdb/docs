To restore a managed backup successfully in CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }}, you must have the appropriate [permissions]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}) on both the source and destination clusters:

- You must have either the [Cluster Admin]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-admin) or [Cluster Operator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-operator) role on the **destination cluster**, or at the [organization level]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#overview-of-the-cockroachdb-cloud-authorization-model). Without one of these roles, the restore job will fail.
- You must also have either the [Cluster Admin]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-admin) or [Cluster Operator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-operator) role on the **source cluster** (the cluster from which the backup was taken), or at the [organization level]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#overview-of-the-cockroachdb-cloud-authorization-model). If you do not have the required permissions on the source cluster, the restore will fail.

Organization-level permissions take precedence over cluster-specific permissions. If you have the appropriate role at the organization level, you are authorized to perform restore operations on all clusters within that organization.
