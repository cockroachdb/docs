    A {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}**Folder Admin**{% else %}[**Folder Admin**]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#folder-admin){% endif %} can create, rename, and move, or delete folders where they are granted the role, and they can also manage access to these folders. This role can be granted at the level of the organization or on a specific folder. If granted at the level of the organization, the role grants the ability to view all users and service accounts in the organization. If granted on a specific folder, the role is inherited by descendant folders.

    A user with the {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}[Org Administrator](#org-administrator){% else %}[Org Administrator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#org-administrator){% endif %} role can grant themselves, another user, or a service account the Folder Admin role.

    To create or manage clusters in a folder, a Folder Admin also needs the {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}[Cluster Administrator](#cluster-administrator) or [Cluster Creator](#cluster-creator){% else %}[Cluster Administrator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-administrator) or [Cluster Creator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#cluster-creator){% endif %} role on that folder directly or by inheritance. To delete a cluster, the Cluster Administrator role is required on the cluster directly or by inheritance.
