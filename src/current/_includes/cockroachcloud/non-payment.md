If a {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organization with billing configured lapses in payment, notices are sent by email to all users with the [Organization Admin]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-admin) or [Billing Coordinator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#billing-coordinator) role. After multiple notices are sent with acknowledgement or change in billing, all clusters in the organization are deleted including data. Deleted clusters cannot be restored.
