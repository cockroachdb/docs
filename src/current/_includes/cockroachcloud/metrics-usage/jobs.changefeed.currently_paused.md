Monitor and alert on this metric to safeguard against an inadvertent operational error of leaving a [changefeed]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) job in a paused state for an extended period of time. Changefeed jobs should not be paused for a long time because the [protected timestamp prevents garbage collection]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md %}#protected-timestamp-and-garbage-collection-monitoring).
