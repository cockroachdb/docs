Connection latency is calculated as the time in nanoseconds between when the cluster receives a connection request and establishes the connection to the client, including [authentication]({% link cockroachcloud/authentication.md %}). This graph shows the p90 and p99 latencies for [SQL connections]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/show-sessions.md %}) to the cluster.<br /><br />These metrics characterize the database connection latency which can affect the application performance, for example, by having slow startup times. Connection failures are not recorded in these metrics.
