    <p class="feature-description">
      Users can now store [`VECTOR`]({% link v24.2/vector.md %}) embeddings within CockroachDB with <code>pgvector</code>-compatible semantics to build AI-driven applications. Numerous [built-in functions]({% link v24.2/functions-and-operators.md %}#pgvector-functions) have been added for running similarity search across vectors. Note that vector indexing is not supported in this release. This feature is in [Preview]({% link v24.2/cockroachdb-feature-availability.md %}).

    <p class="feature-description">
      Users can now enable [generic query plans]({% link v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#query-plan-type). Generic query plans optimize query execution for prepared statements by reusing precompiled query plans, and significantly reduce the CPU overhead associated with parsing and planning repeated queries, at the expense of plan quality. This feature is in [Preview]({% link v24.2/cockroachdb-feature-availability.md %}).
