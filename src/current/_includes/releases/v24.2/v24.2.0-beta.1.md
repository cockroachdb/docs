## v24.2.0-beta.1

Release Date: July 18, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Added support for a custom certificate authority (CA) to verify certificates from the JWT issuer domain, which hosts the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) configuration that is fetched to validate JWT, along with the new [cluster setting]({% link v24.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `server.jwt_authentication.issuer_custom_ca` to set the custom root CA. [#126062][#126062]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- [Job]({% link v24.2/show-jobs.md %}) status changes now log events to the [OPS channel]({% link v24.2/logging.md %}#logging-channels), to indicate the previous and new status of the job. [#125319][#125319]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- The new [cluster setting]({% link v24.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `server.oidc_authentication.client.timeout` allows configuration of the HTTP client timeout for external calls made during [OIDC authentication]({% link v24.2/sso-db-console.md %}). The default timeout is 30 seconds. [#125767][#125767]
- The [Kafka sink for changefeeds]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}) now supports authentication using AWS IAM roles, providing a more secure method for connecting to AWS Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) clusters. [#125745][#125745]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) encoding, decoding, and operators, without index acceleration. [#124292][#124292]
- Added support for generic query plans to the [optimizer]({% link v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) to reduce the computational burden of query optimization by caching and reusing plans in later executions of the same statement. "Custom" query plans are optimized on every execution, while "generic" plans are optimized once and reused on future executions. Generic query plans are beneficial in cases where query optimization contributes significant overhead to the total cost of executing a query. [#126528][#126528] [#127012][#127012]
  - When the [session setting]({% link v24.2/session-variables.md %}) `plan_cache_mode` is set to `auto`, the system automatically determines whether to use custom or generic query plans for the execution of a prepared statement.
  - When the [session setting]({% link v24.2/session-variables.md %}) `plan_cache_mode` is set to `force_generic_plan`, prepared statements will reuse optimized query plans without re-optimization, as long as the plans do not become stale due to schema changes or new table statistics.
  - The setting is used during `EXECUTE` commands and the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output includes a `plan type` field that displays: `generic, re-optimized` if the plan is optimized for the current execution, `generic, reused` if the plan is reused without re-optimization, or `custom` for other plans.
- The output of [`SHOW GRANTS`]({% link v24.2/show-grants.md %}) for a role now includes privileges inherited from the `public` role, which is a [default role]({% link v24.2/security-reference/authorization.md %}#default-roles) defined on every cluster. [#127086][#127086]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- For the [TELEMETRY channel]({% link v24.2/logging.md %}#telemetry), TCL `sampled_query` events will now be sampled at the rate specified by the setting `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.max_event_frequency`, which is already used to limit the rate of sampling DML statements. [#126484][#126484]
- The `encode-uri` command now supports the `--certs-dir` option as an alternative to passing individual certificate paths. [#126793][#126793]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The new `--shutdown` flag of the [`cockroach node drain`]({% link v24.2/cockroach-node.md %}#subcommands) command shuts down the node automatically after draining successfully completes. [#126950][#126950]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug on the node list of the [Cluster overview]({% link v24.2/ui-cluster-overview-page.md %}) page where the icons present on certain tables to expand and collapse expandable rows did not work. [#126639][#126639]
- Fixed a bug that prevented fast path inserts into regional by row tables with uniqueness constraints under [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.2/read-committed.md %}) isolation. [#126504][#126504]
- Fixed a bug where the `sql.stats.discarded.current` [metric]({% link v24.2/metrics.md %}) omitted discarded statements from its count. Both discarded statements and transactions are included in the metric. [#126585][#126585]
- Fixed a bug where the [Database page]({% link v24.2/ui-databases-page.md %}) could crash if range information is not available. [#126419][#126419]
- Fixed a bug that caused [background jobs]({% link v24.2/show-jobs.md %}) to incorrectly respect a statement timeout. [#126336][#126336]  
- Fixed a bug when [creating partial statistics]({% link v24.2/create-statistics.md %}) with the [USING EXTREMES option]({% link v24.2/sql-grammar.md %}#create_stats_option) (disabled by default) where the merged statistic could contain inaccurate `DISTINCT` counts. [#126830][#126830]
- Fixed bug where a [replication zone configuration]({% link v24.2/configure-replication-zones.md %}) for a partition key could disappear during truncation. [#126531][#126531]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The efficiency of merging partial statistics into existing [statistics]({% link v24.2/create-statistics.md %}) has been improved. [#126830][#126830]
- The [optimizer]({% link v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) now generates more efficient plans for queries with clauses like `ORDER BY col ASC NULLS LAST` and `ORDER BY col DESC NULLS FIRST` when `col` is guaranteed to not be `NULL`. [#126685][#126685]
