Release Date: June 24, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The following metrics were added for observability into the source of disk writes: - storage.category-pebble-wal.bytes-written - storage.category-pebble-compaction.bytes-written - storage.category-pebble-ingestion.bytes-written - storage.category-pebble-memtable-flush.bytes-written - storage.category-raft-snapshot.bytes-written - storage.category-encryption-registry.bytes-written - storage.category-crdb-log.bytes-written - storage.category-sql-row-spill.bytes-written - storage.category-sql-col-spill.bytes-written - storage.category-unspecified.bytes-written [#119024][#119024]
- The "storage.value_blocks.enabled" setting has been retired; value blocks are always enabled. [#122164][#122164]
- The following metrics were added for improved observability into disk bandwidth: - storage.disk.read-max.bytespersecond - storage.disk.write-max.bytespersecond [#121553][#121553]
- Adds two new cluster settings, `storage.sstable.compression_algorithm_backup_storage` and `storage.sstable.compression_algorithm_backup_transport`, that in addition to the existing cluster setting `storage.sstable.compression_algorithm`, can be used to alter the compression algorithm used for various types of SSTs. [#124245][#124245]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB, SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS, and SHOW JOBS no longer expose user sensitive information like `client_key`. [#122529][#122529]
- Added a new option to JSON-formatted changefeeds (`encode_json_value_null_as_object`) that outputs `'null'::jsonb` as `{"__crdb_json_null__": true}` instead of `null`, to disambiguate between SQL-null and JSON-null. Note that with this option enabled, if the literal value `{"__crdb_json_null__": true}` is present in a JSON value, it will have the same representation as JSON-null with this option enabled. If such a value is encountered in a changefeed, a (rate-limited) warning will be printed to the DEV channel. [#122848][#122848]
- Adds an error message for unsupported pulsar sink parameters. [#124581][#124581]
- The schedule for Scheduled Changefeeds now pauses after being restored onto a different cluster and after completion of physical cluster replication to avoid inadvertent concurrent execution of the same schedule on multiple clusters.  Epic: none [#124631][#124631]
- Add a new metric to facilitate the new changefeed billing strategy for usage in Cockroach Cloud. [#123145][#123145]
- The DEBUG_PAUSE_ON option has been removed entirely and replaced with the 'restore.restore_after_failure' pause point to match other pause points used throughout the codebase. You can set this pause point by running  `SET CLUSTER SETTING jobs.debug.pausepoints = 'restore.after_restore_failure'` [#125158][#125158]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Default schema privilege changes will now be reflected and can be monitored in the pg_default_acl table [#121506][#121506]
- Previously, we added support for settings reegion on the system database, which was limited to tenants only. We lifted this limitation to allow ALTER DATABASE PRIMARY REGION to work on system tenants. To support preview status, we created a cluster setting called sql.multiregion.preview_multiregion_system_database that will give users the option to set up their system database as multi-region for Cockroach dedicated (this cluster setting is not enabled by default). Note that after adding non-primary regions, we recommend that users do a rolling restart to propogate region information. [#121293][#121293]
- The schema of `pg_catalog.pg_proc` virtual table now matches exactly that of Postgres of versions 14 through 16. The following changes are applied: - `proisagg` and `proiswindow` columns are removed (done in V11) - `protransform` column is removed (done in V12) - `prosqlbody` column is added (done in V14) - `prosupport` and `prokind` columns are moved into their correct spot (these were incorrectly present in the end of the columns list). [#121966][#121966]
- New queries `SHOW EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS` and `SHOW EXTERNAL CONNECTION <connection name>` have been added. These queries display redacted connection URIs and other useful information such as the connection type. Access to these queries is restricted to the owner of the connection or users with `USAGE` privilege. Admin or root users will have unrestricted access to all connections. [#123545][#123545]
- Using the CREATE STATISTICS command without the AS OF SYSTEM TIME option could contend with concurrent transactions and cost performance. Running CREATE STATISTICS without specifying AS OF SYSTEM TIME now uses a default of -1us. [#124488][#124488]
- "nodes" field of EXPLAIN ANALYZE output has been renamed to "sql nodes" to clarify that this field is about SQL processing (in other words, it doesn't include any information about KV nodes that might have participated in the query execution). [#124681][#124681]
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE output now has a new field "KV nodes" which includes all KV nodes that were used to serve read requests by a particular SQL operator. [#124681][#124681]
- Allow foreign keys to be created over stored computed columns. However, most ON UPDATE and ON DELETE options for foreign key constraints are not allowed with computed columns.  Only the following are supported: ON UPDATE (NO ACTION|RESTRICT), ON DELETE (NO ACTION|RESTRICT|CASCADE). [#124851][#124851]
- New field "used follower read" is added to EXPLAIN ANALYZE output to SQL operators whenever their reads were served by the follower replicas (previously, this information was only available in the trace). [#125152][#125152]
- New attribute `historical: AS OF SYSTEM TIME ...` is now included into EXPLAIN ANALYZE output whenever the query performs historical reads. [#125152][#125152]
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE statements are now supported when executed via UI SQL shell. [#125455][#125455]
- Histograms are no longer constructed using a default sample size of 10k. Samples are now dynamically sized based on table size unless the sample count has been set in the table or cluster settings. [#125345][#125345]
- The optimizer will now generate plans utilizing partial indexes with `IS NOT NULL` predicates in more cases. [#125487][#125487]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a distinction between row updates (`row`) and resolved timestamp (`resolved`) messages in some changefeed metrics. [#122645][#122645]
- Modified the default grafana dashboards to include a breakdown by message type for the changefeed emitted-rows metric. [#122802][#122802]
- We are updating generated doc descriptions for system visible cluster settings to reflect these are read-only for serverless and read-write for rest [#124028][#124028]
- Enabling the `server.telemetry.hot_ranges_stats.enabled` setting no longer requires the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` setting to be set to true. Because `server.telemetry.hot_ranges_stats.enabled` is enabled by default, those who have `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` set to false and no explicit setting for `server.telemetry.hot_ranges_stats.enabled` will now see hot ranges stats in their telemetry logs. [#124425][#124425]
- Add cluster setting `debug.zip.redact_addresses.enabled` which allows the user to enable/disable redaction of fields like hostname and IP addresses [#123544][#123544]
- Improve disk usage metric reporting over volumes that dynamically change their size over the life of the cockroach process. [#124999][#124999]
- Crdb_internal.cluster_execution_insights.txt and crdb_internal.cluster_txn_execution_insights.txt have been removed from the debug zip. These files contained cluster-wide insights for statements and transactions. Users can still rely on the per-node execution insights in crdb_internal.node_execution_insights.txt and crdb_internal.node_txn_execution_insights.txt. [#125654][#125654]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The "Goroutine Scheduling Latency" graph has been added to the Runtime page in Metrics. [#121369][#121369]
- Time format with milliseconds uses `.` (dot) as separation between seconds and milliseconds. Affects many pages in Db Console. [#121456][#121456]
- The Storage metrics dashboard now contains a graph categorizing disk writes that contribute to `sys.host.disk.write.bytes` according to the source of the write (WAL, compactions, sstable ingestion, memtable flushes, raft snapshots, encryption registry, logs, SQL columnar spill, or SQL row spill). [#119024][#119024]
- The favicon now renders properly for DB Console along with other image files. [#121380][#121380]
- Color of unavailable ranges on the summary bar to be red when nonzero. [#123120][#123120]
- Removes $ sign on Databases and Jobs pages. [#125370][#125370]
- Added two graphs to the storage metrics dashboard which display count and size of L0 SStables in Pebble. This provides increased visibility into L0 compaction issues. [#125653][#125653]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Removed p95 metrics from tooltip of row TTL's graph, as there are no p95 values computed for any of the metrics currently. [#122345][#122345]
- Fix a crash introduced in v23.2.5 and v24.1.0-beta.2 that could occur when planning statistics collection on a table with a virtual computed column using a user-defined type when the newly-introduced cluster setting `sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled` is set to true. (The setting was introduced in v23.2.4 and v24.1.0-alpha.1.) [#123926][#123926]
- SHOW TYPES includes user defined composite types. It omitted those types ever since composite types were added in 23.1. [#124730][#124730]
- Fixed a bug where telemetry logs were had the same statement fingerprint id for different sql statements. [#124628][#124628]
- "Regions" field of EXPLAIN ANALYZE output has been fixed to include regions of KV nodes (previously, only regions of SQL nodes involved in query processing were included). [#124888][#124888]
- Fixed handling in the DSC when columns are included in the STORING() clause of CREATE INDEX. We now check if the column is virtual up front, and properly detect when a column is already handled by an existing index when the column name has UTF-8 characters. [#124981][#124981]
- Fixed an issue where adding a column with a default value of an empty array would not succeed. [#125284][#125284]
- ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE will now fail with a well-formed error message and code 42601 if a statement tries to add a unique constraint on an expression. [#125282][#125282]
- Resolves a concerning log message that says "expiration of liveness record ... is not greater than expiration of the previous lease ... after liveness heartbeat". This message is no longer possible. [#124885][#124885]
- Fixed a bug in v24.1, v23.2, and v23.1 where using changefeed.aggregator.flush_jitter with min_checkpoint_frequency set to zero could cause panics. [#125317][#125317]
- Fixed a bug where the public schema would be created with the wrong owner. Previously the admin role would own the public schema. Now, the database owner is also the owner of the public schema. The ownership can be altered after the schema is created. [#124894][#124894]
- Previously, CockroachDB would hit an internal error when evaluating INSERTs into REGIONAL BY ROW tables where the source is a VALUES clause with a single row and at least one boolean expression, and this is now fixed. The bug was introduced in 23.2.0 release. [#125492][#125492]
- Fixes a bug in logging where error code was misreported for cancelled queries. Affected channels: SQL_PERF (slow query logs), SQL_EXEC (sql exec logs). [#124371][#124371]
- Fix a bug in which constant LIKE patterns containing certain sequences of backslashes did not become constrained scans. This bug has been present since v21.1.13 when support for building constrained scans from LIKE patterns containing backslashes was added. [#125507][#125507]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- More efficient query plans are now generated for queries with text similarity filters, e.g., `text_col % 'foobar'`. These plans are generated if the `optimizer_use_trigram_similarity_optimization` session setting is enabled, which it is by default (though it will be disabled by default in previous versions). [#121973][#121973]
- Schema changes that cause a data backfill, such as adding a non-nullable column or changing the primary key, now will split and scatter the temporary indexes used to perform the change. This reduces the chance of causing a write hotspot that can slow down foreground traffic. [#120736][#120736]
- Multiple/large amounts of grants on tables and types within one transaction now run faster. [#123414][#123414]
- Lock operations are now removed from query plans when the optimizer can prove that no rows would be locked. [#124830][#124830]
- Some privilege checks when scanning the `crdb_internal.system_jobs` internal table now happen once before the scan, instead of once for each row. This will improve performance for queries that read from `crdb_internal.system_jobs`. [#117438][#117438]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<h4 id="v24-2-0-alpha-1-missing-category">Missing category</h4>

- The cluster setting kv.rangefeed.range_stuck_threshold has been removed. [#125663][#125663]
- Nonoe [#124104][#124104]
