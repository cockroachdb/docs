## v24.2.6

Release Date: December 12, 2024

<h3 id="v24-2-6-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- All cluster settings that accept strings are now fully redacted when transmitted as part of our diagnostics telemetry. This payload includes a record of modified cluster settings and their values when they are not strings. Customers who previously applied the mitigations in Technical Advisory 133479 can safely set the value of cluster setting `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` to false and turn on diagnostic reporting via the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` cluster setting without leaking sensitive cluster settings values. [#134017][#134017]

<h3 id="v24-2-6-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- COCKROACH_SKIP_ENABLING_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORTING is no longer mentioned in the demo command. [#134088][#134088]

<h3 id="v24-2-6-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Add `system.users` to the list of system tables that changefeeds protect with PTS. This table is required for CDC Queries. [#134837][#134837]

<h3 id="v24-2-6-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The goschedstats.always_use_short_sample_period.enabled setting should be set to true for any serious production cluster, to prevent unnecessary queuing in admission control CPU queues. [#133584][#133584]
- A new cluster setting `ui.database_locality_metadata.enabled` allows operators to disable loading extended database and table region information in the DB Console Database and Table pages. This information can cause significant CPU load on large clusters with many ranges. Versions of this page from 24.3 onwards do not have this problem. If customers will require this data, they can use the `SHOW RANGES FROM {DATABASE| TABLE}` query via SQL to compute on-demand. [#134095][#134095]
- The row-level TTL job now will periodically log progress by showing the number of table spans that have been processed so far. [#135170][#135170]

<h3 id="v24-2-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A bug has been fixed that caused non-reusable query plans, e.g., plans for DDL and `SHOW ...` statements, to be cached and reused in future executions, possibly causing stale results to be returned. This bug only occurred when `plan_cache_mode` was set to `auto` or `force_generic_plan`, both of which are not currently the default settings. [#133074][#133074]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an internal error of the form `interface conversion: coldata.Column is` in an edge case and this is now fixed. The bug is present in versions 22.2.13+, 23.1.9+, 23.2+. [#133761][#133761]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect NOT NULL constraint violation errors on `UPSERT` and `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT .. DO UPDATE` statements when those statements updated an existing row and a subset of columns which did not include a `NOT NULL` column of the table. This bug has been present since at least version 20.1.0. [#133821][#133821]
- Fix an unhandled error that could occur when using `REVOKE ... ON SEQUENCE FROM ... user` on an object that is not a sequence. [#133709][#133709]
- Address a panic inside CREATE TABLE AS if sequence builtin expressions had invalid function overloads. [#133869][#133869]
- String constants can now be compared against collated strings. [#134084][#134084]
- Previously, when executing queries with index / lookup joins when the ordering needs to be maintained, CockroachDB in some cases could get into a pathological behavior which would lead to increased query latency, possibly by several orders of magnitude. This bug was introduced in 22.2 and is now fixed. [#134366][#134366]
- Fixed a minor bug where DISCARD ALL statements were counted under the sql.ddl.count metric. Now these will be counted under the sql.misc.count metric. [#134509][#134509]
- Addressed a bug with DROP CASCADE that would occasionally panic with an undropped backref message on partitioned tables. [#134472][#134472]
- Reduce the duration of partitions in the gossip network when a node crashes in order to eliminate false positives in the `ranges.unavailable` metric. [#134600][#134600]
- When you are a non-admin user and you run drop role if exists on a user that does not exist you no longer get an error message. [#134969][#134969]
- Fixed a bug that caused quotes around the name of a routine to be dropped when it was called within another routine. This could prevent the correct routine from being resolved if the nested routine name was case-sensitive. The bug has existed since v24.1, when nested routines were introduced. [#134000][#134000]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause incorrect query results when the optimizer planned a lookup join on an index containing a column of type `CHAR(N)`, `VARCHAR(N)`, `BIT(N)`, `VARBIT(N)`, or `DECIMAL(M, N)`, and the query held that column constant to a single value (e.g., with an equality filter). [#135076][#135076]
- Fixed an unhandled error that would occur if DROP SCHEMA was executed on the `public` schema of the `system` database, or on an internal schema like `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. [#135180][#135180]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect evaluation of some binary expressions involving `CHAR(N)` values and untyped string literals with trailing whitespace characters. For example, the expression `'f'::CHAR = 'f '` now correctly evaluates to `true`. [#135689][#135689]
- Prevent ALTER DATABASE operations that modify the zone config from hanging if an invalid zone config already exists. [#135215][#135215]
- CREATE SCHEMA now returns the correct error if a the schema name is missing. [#135927][#135927]
- Using more than one DECLARE statment in the definition of a user defined function now correctly declares additional variables. [#135738][#135738]
- Previously, CockroachDB would encounter an internal error when evaluating `FETCH ABSOLUTE 0` statements, and this is now fixed. The bug has been present since 22.1 version. [#134992][#134992]
- Fixed an issue where corrupted table statistics could cause the cockroach process to crash. [#136041][#136041]
- Fix a bug which causes the optimizer to use stale table statistics after altering an enum type used in the table. [#136812][#136812]
