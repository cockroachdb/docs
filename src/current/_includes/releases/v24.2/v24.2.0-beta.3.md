<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- A `--locality-file` flag is now available on the [`cockroach start`](/docs/v24.2/cockroach-start.md) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](/docs/v24.2/cockroach-start-single-node.md) commands. This provides the option of specifing node [locality](/docs/v24.2/cockroach-start.md#locality) (typically a `region` value) as a file, as an alternative to specifying this using the [`--locality` flag](/docs/v24.2/cockroach-start.md#locality). [#127476][#127476]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a formatting issue with the `sql_sequence_cached_node` value of the `serial_normalization` [setting](/docs/v24.2/session-variables.md). This could lead to an error connecting to CockroachDB if this value was set as the default for `serial_normalization` via cluster setting [`sql.defaults.serial_normalization`](/docs/v24.2/cluster-settings.md#setting-sql-defaults-serial-normalization). [#127674][#127674]
- Dropping [ENUM](/docs/v24.2/enum.md)-type values which were referenced by [index expressions](/docs/v24.2/expression-indexes.md) could fail with an error. [#127455][#127455]
