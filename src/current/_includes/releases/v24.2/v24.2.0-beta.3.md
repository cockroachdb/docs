<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- A new `--locality-file` flag has been added to all server start commands. With this flag, locality configurations can be specified via a file, and this has the same effect as providing the file's contents directly via the `--locality` flag. [#127476][#127476]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The sql_sequence_cached_node value of the serial_normalization setting was not correctly formatted. This could lead to errors while connecting to CockroachDB if the default value of serial_normalization was set to serial_normalization. The formatting bug was fixed, which also fixes the errors when connecting. [#127674][#127674]
- Dropping enum types values which were referenced by index expressions could fail with an error. [#127455][#127455]
