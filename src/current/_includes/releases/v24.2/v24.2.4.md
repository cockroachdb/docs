Release Date: October 17, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-2-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Updated the cluster setting [`changefeed.sink_io_workers`]({% link v24.2/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-changefeed-sink-io-workers) with all the [changefeed sinks]({% link v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md %}) that support the setting. [#130374][#130374]
- Added two network metrics, `changefeed.network.bytes_in` and `changefeed.network.bytes_out`. [#130578][#130578]  
  These metrics track the number of bytes sent by individual [changefeeds]({% link v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) to the following sinks: 
	- [Kafka sinks]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}#kafka). If [child metrics are enabled]({% link v24.2/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-server-child-metrics-enabled), the metric will have a `kafka` label. 
	- [Webhook sinks]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}#webhook-sink). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `webhook` label. 
	- [Pub/Sub sinks]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}#google-cloud-pub-sub). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `pubsub` label. 
	- [SQL sink]({% link v24.2/changefeed-for.md %}). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `sql` label.
- Added a `changefeed.total_ranges` metric that can be used to monitor the number of ranges that are watched by [changefeed]({% link v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) aggregators. It shares the same polling interval as `changefeed.lagging_ranges`, which is controlled by the existing `lagging_ranges_polling_interval` option. [#130982][#130982]
- Disambiguated [metrics]({% link v24.2/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md %}) and [logs]({% link v24.2/logging-overview.md %}) for the two buffers used by the KV feed. The following metrics now have a suffix indicating which buffer they correspond to: `changefeed.buffer_entries.*`, `changefeed.buffer_entries_mem.*`, or `changefeed.buffer_pushback_nanos.*`. The previous metric names are retained for backward compatibility. [#131419][#131419]
- Added timers and corresponding [metrics]({% link v24.2/metrics.md %} for key parts of the [changefeed]({% link v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) pipeline to help debug issues with feeds. The `changefeed.stage.{stage}.latency` metrics now emit latency histograms for each stage. The metrics respect the changefeed `scope` label to debug a specific feed. [#131372][#131372]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [session variable]({% link v24.2/set-vars.md %}) `enforce_home_region_follower_reads_enabled` is now deprecated, in favor of `enforce_home_region`. The deprecated variable will be removed in a future release. [#129587][#129587]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the new [metric]({% link v24.2/metrics.md %}) `ranges.decommissioning`  to show the number of ranges that have a replica on a [decommissioning node]({% link v24.2/node-shutdown.md %}?filters=decommission). [#130247][#130247]
- You can now configure the log format for the [`stderr` log sink]({% link v24.2/configure-logs.md %}#output-to-stderr) by setting the `stderr.format` field in the [YAML configuration]({% link v24.2/configure-logs.md %}#yaml-payload). [#131539][#131539]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Streamlined [metric chart]({% link v24.2/ui-overview.md %}#metrics) legends by removing the name of the chart from labels, where it was an identical prefix for all labels on the chart. [#129359][#129359]
- The [DB Console]({% link v24.2/ui-overview.md %}) now shows a notification if the cluster has no Enterprise license set. Refer to [upcoming license changes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/enterprise-license-update/) for more information. [#130417][#130417]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could prevent [upgrade finalization]({% link v24.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}) when attempting to resolve a large number of corrupt descriptors. [#130517][#130517]
- Fixed a potential memory leak in [changefeeds]({% link v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) using a [cloud storage sink]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}#cloud-storage-sink). The memory leak could occur if both [`changefeed.fast_gzip.enabled`]({% link v24.2/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-changefeed-fast-gzip-enabled) and `changefeed.cloudstorage.async_flush.enabled` were `true`, and the changefeed received an error while attempting to write to the cloud storage sink. [#130602][#130602]
- Fixed a bug where zone configuration changes issued by the [declarative schema changer]({% link v24.2/online-schema-changes.md %}) were not blocked if a table had `schema_locked` set. [#130705][#130705]
- Fixed a bug in which some [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`]({% link v24.2/select-for-update.md %}) or [`SELECT FOR SHARE`]({% link v24.2/select-for-update.md %}) queries using `NOWAIT` could still block on locked rows when using the `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` [session setting]({% link v24.2/session-variables.md %}) under [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.2/demo-serializable.md %}) isolation. This bug was introduced with [`optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable`]({% link v24.2/session-variables.md %}#optimizer-use-lock-op-for-serializable) in v23.2.0. [#130430][#130430]
- Fixed a bug that caused the [optimizer]({% link v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) to plan unnecessary post-query uniqueness checks during [`INSERT`]({% link v24.2/insert.md %}), [`UPSERT`]({% link v24.2/upsert.md %}), and [`UPDATE`]({% link v24.2/update.md %}) statements on tables with [partial]({% link v24.2/partial-indexes.md %}), [unique]({% link v24.2/create-index.md %}#unique-indexes) [hash-sharded indexes]({% link v24.2/hash-sharded-indexes.md %}). These unnecessary checks added overhead to execution of these statements, and caused the statements to error when executed under [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.2/read-committed.md %}) isolation. [#130570][#130570]
- Fixed a bug that could result in the inability to garbage collect an [MVCC]({% link v24.2/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#mvcc) range tombstone within a [global table]({% link v24.2/global-tables.md %}). [#130940][#130940]
- Fixed a bug where a connection could be dropped if the client was attempting a [schema change]({% link v24.2/online-schema-changes.md %}) while the same schema objects were being dropped. [#130962][#130962]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2 where the [`IS NOT NULL`]({% link v24.2/null-handling.md %}#nulls-and-simple-comparisons) clause would incorrectly allow tuples containing `NULL` elements, e.g. `(1, NULL)` or `(NULL, NULL)`. [#130947][#130947]
- Fixed a bug that could cause errors with the message `internal error: Non-nullable column ...` when executing statements under [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.2/read-committed.md %}) isolation that involved tables with [`NOT NULL`]({% link v24.2/not-null.md %}) [virtual columns]({% link v24.2/computed-columns.md %}). [#131019][#131019]
- Fixed a bug where [AWS S3 and HTTP client configurations]({% link v24.2/use-cloud-storage.md %}) were not considered when implicit authentication was used. [#131173][#131173]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that can cause incorrect query results under the following conditions:
    1. The query contains a correlated subquery.
    1. The correlated subquery has a `GroupBy` or `DistinctOn` operator with an outer-column reference in its input.
    1. The correlated subquery is in the input of a `SELECT` or `JOIN` clause that has a filter that sets the outer-column reference equal to an inner column that is in the input of the grouping operator.
    1. The set of grouping columns does not include the replacement column explicitly.

    [#130990][#130990]
- Fixed a bug where jobs created in a session with a timezone offset configured could fail to start or could report an incorrect creation time in the output of [`SHOW JOBS`]({% link v24.2/show-jobs.md %}) and in the [DB Console]({% link v24.2/ui-overview.md %}). [#131407][#131407]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a [changefeed]({% link v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) from resuming after a prolonged [paused state]({% link v24.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md %}#pause). [#130921][#130921]
- Fixed a bug where backup schedules could advance a protected timestamp too early, which caused incremental backups to fail. [#131391][#131391]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The [query optimizer]({% link v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) now plans limited [partial index]({% link v24.2/partial-indexes.md %}) scans in more cases when the new [session variable]({% link v24.2/session-variables.md %}) `optimizer_push_limit_into_project_filtered_scan` is set to `on`. [#130335][#130335]
- Reduced the write-amplification impact of rebalances by splitting snapshot [SST files]({% link v24.2/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#pebble) before ingesting them into [Pebble]({% link v24.2/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#ssts). [#128997][#128997]
