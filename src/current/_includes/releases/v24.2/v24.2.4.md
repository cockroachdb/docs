Release Date: October 17, 2024

{% include "_includes/releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md" release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-2-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Updated the cluster setting [`changefeed.sink_io_workers`](/docs/v24.2/cluster-settings.md#setting-changefeed-sink-io-workers) with all the [changefeed sinks](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md) that support the setting. [#130374][#130374]
- Added two network metrics, `changefeed.network.bytes_in` and `changefeed.network.bytes_out`. [#130578][#130578]  
  These metrics track the number of bytes sent by individual [changefeeds](/docs/v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md) to the following sinks: 
	- [Kafka sinks](/docs/v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md#kafka). If [child metrics are enabled](/docs/v24.2/cluster-settings.md#setting-server-child-metrics-enabled), the metric will have a `kafka` label. 
	- [Webhook sinks](/docs/v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md#webhook-sink). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `webhook` label. 
	- [Pub/Sub sinks](/docs/v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md#google-cloud-pub-sub). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `pubsub` label. 
	- [SQL sink](/docs/v24.2/changefeed-for.md). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `sql` label.
- Added a `changefeed.total_ranges` metric that can be used to monitor the number of ranges that are watched by [changefeed](/docs/v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md) aggregators. It shares the same polling interval as `changefeed.lagging_ranges`, which is controlled by the existing `lagging_ranges_polling_interval` option. [#130982][#130982]
- Disambiguated [metrics](/docs/v24.2/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md) and [logs](/docs/v24.2/logging-overview.md) for the two buffers used by the KV feed. The following metrics now have a suffix indicating which buffer they correspond to: `changefeed.buffer_entries.*`, `changefeed.buffer_entries_mem.*`, or `changefeed.buffer_pushback_nanos.*`. The previous metric names are retained for backward compatibility. [#131419][#131419]
- Added timers and corresponding [metrics](/docs/v24.2/metrics.md for key parts of the [changefeed](/docs/v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md) pipeline to help debug issues with feeds. The `changefeed.stage.{stage}.latency` metrics now emit latency histograms for each stage. The metrics respect the changefeed `scope` label to debug a specific feed. [#131372][#131372]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [session variable](/docs/v24.2/set-vars.md) `enforce_home_region_follower_reads_enabled` is now deprecated, in favor of `enforce_home_region`. The deprecated variable will be removed in a future release. [#129587][#129587]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the new [metric](/docs/v24.2/metrics.md) `ranges.decommissioning`  to show the number of ranges that have a replica on a [decommissioning node](/docs/v24.2/node-shutdown.md?filters=decommission). [#130247][#130247]
- You can now configure the log format for the [`stderr` log sink](/docs/v24.2/configure-logs.md#output-to-stderr) by setting the `stderr.format` field in the [YAML configuration](/docs/v24.2/configure-logs.md#yaml-payload). [#131539][#131539]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Streamlined [metric chart](/docs/v24.2/ui-overview.md#metrics) legends by removing the name of the chart from labels, where it was an identical prefix for all labels on the chart. [#129359][#129359]
- The [DB Console](/docs/v24.2/ui-overview.md) now shows a notification if the cluster has no Enterprise license set. Refer to [upcoming license changes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/enterprise-license-update/) for more information. [#130417][#130417]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could prevent [upgrade finalization](/docs/v24.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.md) when attempting to resolve a large number of corrupt descriptors. [#130517][#130517]
- Fixed a potential memory leak in [changefeeds](/docs/v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md) using a [cloud storage sink](/docs/v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md#cloud-storage-sink). The memory leak could occur if both [`changefeed.fast_gzip.enabled`](/docs/v24.2/cluster-settings.md#setting-changefeed-fast-gzip-enabled) and `changefeed.cloudstorage.async_flush.enabled` were `true`, and the changefeed received an error while attempting to write to the cloud storage sink. [#130602][#130602]
- Fixed a bug where zone configuration changes issued by the [declarative schema changer](/docs/v24.2/online-schema-changes.md#declarative-schema-changer) were not blocked if a table had `schema_locked` set. [#130705][#130705]
- Fixed a bug in which some [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](/docs/v24.2/select-for-update.md) or [`SELECT FOR SHARE`](/docs/v24.2/select-for-update.md) queries using `NOWAIT` could still block on locked rows when using the `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` [session setting](/docs/v24.2/session-variables.md) under [`SERIALIZABLE`](/docs/v24.2/demo-serializable.md) isolation. This bug was introduced with [`optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable`](/docs/v24.2/session-variables.md#optimizer-use-lock-op-for-serializable) in v23.2.0. [#130430][#130430]
- Fixed a bug that caused the [optimizer](/docs/v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md) to plan unnecessary post-query uniqueness checks during [`INSERT`](/docs/v24.2/insert.md), [`UPSERT`](/docs/v24.2/upsert.md), and [`UPDATE`](/docs/v24.2/update.md) statements on tables with [partial](/docs/v24.2/partial-indexes.md), [unique](/docs/v24.2/create-index.md#unique-indexes) [hash-sharded indexes](/docs/v24.2/hash-sharded-indexes.md). These unnecessary checks added overhead to execution of these statements, and caused the statements to error when executed under [`READ COMMITTED`](/docs/v24.2/read-committed.md) isolation. [#130570][#130570]
- Fixed a bug that could result in the inability to garbage collect an [MVCC](/docs/v24.2/architecture/storage-layer.md#mvcc) range tombstone within a [global table](/docs/v24.2/global-tables.md). [#130940][#130940]
- Fixed a bug where a connection could be dropped if the client was attempting a [schema change](/docs/v24.2/online-schema-changes.md) while the same schema objects were being dropped. [#130962][#130962]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2 where the [`IS NOT NULL`](/docs/v24.2/null-handling.md#nulls-and-simple-comparisons) clause would incorrectly allow tuples containing `NULL` elements, e.g. `(1, NULL)` or `(NULL, NULL)`. [#130947][#130947]
- Fixed a bug that could cause errors with the message `internal error: Non-nullable column ...` when executing statements under [`READ COMMITTED`](/docs/v24.2/read-committed.md) isolation that involved tables with [`NOT NULL`](/docs/v24.2/not-null.md) [virtual columns](/docs/v24.2/computed-columns.md). [#131019][#131019]
- Fixed a bug where [AWS S3 and HTTP client configurations](/docs/v24.2/use-cloud-storage.md) were not considered when implicit authentication was used. [#131173][#131173]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that can cause incorrect query results under the following conditions:
    1. The query contains a correlated subquery.
    1. The correlated subquery has a `GroupBy` or `DistinctOn` operator with an outer-column reference in its input.
    1. The correlated subquery is in the input of a `SELECT` or `JOIN` clause that has a filter that sets the outer-column reference equal to an inner column that is in the input of the grouping operator.
    1. The set of grouping columns does not include the replacement column explicitly.

    [#130990][#130990]
- Fixed a bug where jobs created in a session with a timezone offset configured could fail to start or could report an incorrect creation time in the output of [`SHOW JOBS`](/docs/v24.2/show-jobs.md) and in the [DB Console](/docs/v24.2/ui-overview.md). [#131407][#131407]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a [changefeed](/docs/v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md) from resuming after a prolonged [paused state](/docs/v24.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md#pause). [#130921][#130921]
- Fixed a bug where backup schedules could advance a protected timestamp too early, which caused incremental backups to fail. [#131391][#131391]

<h3 id="v24-2-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The [query optimizer](/docs/v24.2/cost-based-optimizer.md) now plans limited [partial index](/docs/v24.2/partial-indexes.md) scans in more cases when the new [session variable](/docs/v24.2/session-variables.md) `optimizer_push_limit_into_project_filtered_scan` is set to `on`. [#130335][#130335]
- Reduced the write-amplification impact of rebalances by splitting snapshot [SST files](/docs/v24.2/architecture/storage-layer.md#pebble) before ingesting them into [Pebble](/docs/v24.2/architecture/storage-layer.md#ssts). [#128997][#128997]
