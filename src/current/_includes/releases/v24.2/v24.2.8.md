## v24.2.8

Release Date: January 9, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-2-8-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- In order to improve the granularity of changefeed pipeline metrics, the changefeed metrics changefeed.admit_latency and changefeed.commit_latency have histogram buckets from 5ms to 60m (previously  500ms to 5m). The changefeed metrics changefeed.parallel_io_queue_nanos, changefeed.parallel_io_result_queue_nanos, changefeed.sink_batch_hist_nanos, changefeed.flush_hist_nanos, and changefeed.kafka_throttling_hist_nanos have histogram buckets from 5ms to 10m (previously 500ms to 5m). [#136603][#136603]
- Add support for multiple seed brokers in the new kafka sink. [#136748][#136748]
- Add a new metric (`distsender.rangefeed.catchup_ranges_waiting_client_side`) that counts how many rangefeeds are waiting on the client-side limiter to start performing catchup scans. [#136835][#136835]

<h3 id="v24-2-8-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Adds changefeed support for the mvcc_timestamp option with the avro format. If both options are specified, the avro schema includes an mvcc_timestamp metadata field and emits the row's mvcc timestamp with the row data. [#136016][#136016]
- Adds no-op AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE param for forwards compatibility with 24.3. [#137025][#137025]

<h3 id="v24-2-8-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting has been added, which reverts the changes of #133037 that cause the change in typing behavior described in #137837. Specifically, it makes type-checking and overload resolution ignore the newly added "unpreferred" overloads. This setting defaults to `on`. [#137920][#137920]

<h3 id="v24-2-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Removed the sql.auth.resolve_membership_single_scan.enabled cluster setting. This was added out of precaution in case it was necessary to revert back to the old behavior for looking up role memberships, but this escape hatch has never been needed in practice since this was added in v23.1. [#136161][#136161]
- Telemetry delivery is now considered successful even in cases where we experience a network timeout. This will prevent throttling in cases outside an operator's control. [#136479][#136479]
- When a schema change job is completed, rolls back, or encounteres a failure, the time taken since the job began is now logged in a structured log in the SQL_SCHEMA log channel. [#136928][#136928]
- Adds a new configurable parameter kv.transaction.max_intents_and_locks which will prevent transactions from creating too many intents. [#137700][#137700]
- Add metric txn.count_limit_rejected. [#137700][#137700]
- Add metric txn.count_limit_on_response. [#137700][#137700]

<h3 id="v24-2-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL was not enforced consistently when the table created in the same txn. [#136365][#136365]
- Create relation / type could leave dangling namespace entries if the schema was concurrently being dropped. [#136379][#136379]
- The `idle_in_session_timeout` setting now excludes the time spent waiting for schema changer jobs to complete, preventing unintended session termination during schema change operations. [#136502][#136502]
- Fix a bug which causes the optimizer to use stale table statistics after altering an enum type used in the table. [#136759][#136759]
- Table statistics collection in CockroachDB could previously run into `no bytes in account to release` errors in some edge cases (when the SQL memory budget, configured via `--max-sql-memory` flag, was close to being exhausted). The bug has been present since 21.2 and is now fixed. [#136165][#136165]
- CockroachDB now better respects `statement_timeout` limit on queries involving the top K sort and merge join operations. [#136652][#136652]
- Fixed an issue where license enforcement was not consistently disabled for single-node clusters started with start-single-node, ensuring proper behavior on cluster restarts. [#137011][#137011]
- Fix a bug that caused queries against tables with user-defined types to sometimes fail with errors after restoring those tables. [#137354][#137354]
- Fixed bug that causes an incorrect filesystem to be logged as part of the store information. [#137113][#137113]
- Fix a bug which causes the optimizer to use stale table statistics after altering an enum type used in the table. [#137592][#137592]
- Fixed a bug existing since v24.1 that would cause a set-returning UDF with OUT parameters to return a single row. [#137377][#137377]
- Fixed a bug that could cause an internal error if a table with an implicit (rowid) primary key was locked from within a subquery, like this: ``` SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM foo WHERE x = 2) FOR UPDATE; ``` The error could occur either under read-committed isolation, or with `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` enabled. [#137129][#137129]
- Fixed an issue where adding an existing column with the IF NOT EXISTS option could exit too early, skipping necessary handling of the AST. This could lead to statement failure of the ALTER. [#137676][#137676]
- Fixed a bug related to displaying the names of composite types in the SHOW CREATE TABLES command. The names are now shown as two-part names, which disambiguates the output and makes it more portable to other databases. [#137768][#137768]
- An issue where a schema change could incorrectly cause a changefeed to fail with an assertion error like `received boundary timestamp ... of type ... before reaching existing boundary of type ...` has now been fixed. [#137705][#137705]
- Internal scans are now exempt from the sql.defaults.disallow_full_table_scans.enabled setting, allowing index creation even when the cluster setting is active. [#137724][#137724]

<h3 id="v24-2-8-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved the internal caching logic for role membership information. This reduces the latency impact of commands such as `DROP ROLE`, `CREATE ROLE`, and `GRANT role TO user`, which cause the role membership cache to be invalidated. [#136161][#136161]
