<h3 id="v24-2-0-rc-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added a new Kafka [changefeed sink]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}) that uses the [`franz-go` library](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) and CockroachDB's `batching_sink` implementation. The new Kafka sink can be enabled with the [`changefeed.new_kafka_sink_enabled`]({% link v24.2/cluster-settings.md %}) cluster setting, which is disabled by default. [#127899][#127899]
- The v2 Kafka [changefeed sink]({% link v24.2/changefeed-sinks.md %}) now supports [Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) IAM SASL authentication. [#127899][#127899]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-rc-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [Databases]({% link v24.2/ui-databases-page.md %}) and [Tables]({% link v24.2/ui-databases-page.md %}#tables-view) pages in the [DB Console]({% link v24.2/ui-overview.md %}) will show a loading state while loading information for databases and tables including size and range counts. [#127696][#127696]
- On the [Database details]({% link v24.2/ui-databases-page.md %}) page, the table name will no longer appear with quotes around the schema and table name. [#127770][#127770]

<h3 id="v24-2-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak when executing SQL statements with comments, for example, `SELECT /* comment */ 1;`. Memory owned by a SQL session would continue to grow as these types of statements were executed. The memory would only be released when closing the [SQL session]({% link v24.2/show-sessions.md %}). This bug has been present since v23.1. [#127760][#127760]
- Fixed a bug in [debug zip]({% link v24.2/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}) generation where an error was produced while fetching unstructured/malformed [logs]({% link v24.2/log-formats.md %}). [#127883][#127883]
- Fixed small memory leaks that occur during [changefeed creation]({% link v24.2/create-changefeed.md %}). [#127899][#127899]
- Fixed a [known limitation]({% link v24.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.md %}#known-limitations) in which [fast cutback]({% link v24.2/cutover-replication.md %}#cut-back-to-the-primary-cluster) could fail. Users can now protect data for the [default protection window]({% link v24.2/physical-cluster-replication-technical-overview.md %}) of 4 hours on both the primary and the standby clusters.
