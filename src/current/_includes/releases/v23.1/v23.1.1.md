- In CockroachDB v23.1.0 and its testing releases, executing [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/copy-from) to a target table that has multiple column families could corrupt the table. If data was copied into a table with existing rows, the data in those rows may be irrecoverable. The data would need to be dropped and re-[copied](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/copy-from) to be encoded correctly. This has now been fixed. See [Technical Advisory 103220](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/advisories/a103220) for more information. [#103323][#103323]
