<h3 id="v23-1-16-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/use-changefeeds#enable-rangefeeds) resolved timestamps could get stuck, continually emitting the [log message](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/logging) `"pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split"`, typically following a [range merge](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/distribution-layer#range-merges). This bug was introduced in v23.1.15. [#119559][#119559]
