<h3 id="v23-1-0-beta-2-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- [CDC queries]({% link v23.1/create-changefeed.md %}) now support wrapped envelope with diff (`envelope='wrapped', diff`). [#101391][#101391]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the [session variable]({% link v23.1/set-vars.md %}#supported-variables) `multiple_active_portals_enabled`. This setting is only for a [preview feature]({% link v23.1/cockroachdb-feature-availability.md %}). When set to `true`, it allows multiple portals to be open at the same time, with their execution interleaved with each other. In other words, these portals can be paused. The underlying statement for a pausable portal must be a read-only [`SELECT`]({% link v23.1/selection-queries.md %}) query without [sub-queries]({% link v23.1/subqueries.md %}) or postqueries (such as executed by [foreign key]({% link v23.1/foreign-key.md %}) checks), and such a portal is always executed with a [local query plan](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/sql-layer#distsql). [#101026][#101026]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Update sort label on *Search Criteria* to match the name on the table columns on the [Statements]({% link v23.1/ui-statements-page.md %}) and [Transactions]({% link v23.1/ui-transactions-page.md %}) pages. [#101126][#101126]
- By default, we now show the `Application Name` column in the fingerprints overview pages. [Statement fingerprints]({% link v23.1/ui-statements-page.md %}#statement-fingerprints-view) and [Transaction fingerprints]({% link v23.1/ui-transactions-page.md %}#transaction-fingerprints-view) will be displayed per application on the overview pages rather than grouped into a single fingerprint ID. [#101235][#101235]
- When going from the Fingerprint Overview pages or the Insight Details pages to the Fingerprint Details page for [statements]({% link v23.1/ui-statements-page.md %}#statement-fingerprints-view) or [transactions]({% link v23.1/ui-transactions-page.md %}#transaction-fingerprints-view), the details page will fetch data for the statement with the provided application name. For overview pages, this is the app name of the selected row. For insight details, it is the app of the execution that generated the insight. [#101235][#101235]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug so that the text search `@@` [operator]({% link v23.1/functions-and-operators.md %}) ("matches") can work with variable expressions. Fixed a bug where incorrect results were returned when one of the arguments was a [`TEXT`]({% link v23.1/string.md %}) expression and the other argument was a `TEXT` or `TSQuery` expression. [#100918][#100918]
- Fixed a bug where running [`DROP COLUMN ... CASCADE`]({% link v23.1/alter-table.md %}#drop-column) when that column is used in an [index]({% link v23.1/indexes.md %}) that includes other columns caused a panic. [#100856][#100856]
- Fixed a rare race condition on [node startup]({% link v23.1/cockroach-start.md %}) that could cause an `invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` error. [#100626][#100626]
- Fixed a bug that was causing nodes running on Windows to crash on startup. This bug only existed in v23.1 alphas. [#101091][#101091]
- Fixed a rare condition that could allow a [transaction]({% link v23.1/transactions.md %}) to get stuck indefinitely waiting on a released row-level [lock](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/transaction-layer#concurrency-control) if the per-range lock count limit was exceeded while the transaction was waiting on another lock. [#100946][#100946]
- Fixed a rare internal error in the [optimizer]({% link v23.1/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) that has existed since before version v22.1, which could occur while enforcing orderings between SQL operators. [#101355][#101355]
- Fixed a bug so that the `crdb_internal.deserialize_session` internal function works properly with prepared statements that have more param type hints than params. Before this bugfix, deserializing a [session]({% link v23.1/show-sessions.md %}) containing a prepared statement with more parameter type hints than parameters would panic. For example: `PREPARE p (int) AS SELECT 1`. These extra type hints are now ignored by `crdb_internal.deserialize_session`. [#101368][#101368]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Google Cloud Pub/Sub sink [changefeeds]({% link v23.1/create-changefeed.md %}) can now support higher throughputs by enabling the `changefeed.new_pubsub_sink_enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v23.1/cluster-settings.md %}). Enabling this setting will cause changefeeds to use a newer Pub/Sub sink, which uses capitalized top-level fields in the message: `{Key: ..., Value: ..., Topic: ...}`. As a result, you may need to reconfigure downstream systems to parse the new message format. If you do not enable `changefeed.new_pubsub_sink_enabled`, the top-level message fields remain all lowercase: `{key: ..., value: ..., topic: ...}`. [#100930][#100930]
