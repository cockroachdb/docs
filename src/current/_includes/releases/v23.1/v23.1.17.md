## v23.1.17

Release Date: March 19, 2024

<h3 id="v23-1-17-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- A user with the [`VIEWACTIVITY` privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization#supported-privileges) can now request a statement bundle from the [**Statements** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-statements-page) in the DB Console or with the internal builtin function `crdb_internal.requests_statement_bundle`. [#119638][#119638]
- Clusters using [Cluster Single Sign-on (SSO) with JSON web tokens (JWTs)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/sso-sql) can now optionally fetch signing keys from configured issuers instead of configuring static signing keys for each issuer. When the new [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `server.jwt_authentication.jwks_auto_fetch.enabled` is set to `true`, signing keys are automatically fetched from the issuer using metadata published in its OpenID configuration. In this case, static signing keys in `server.jwt_authentication.jwks` are ignored. When automatic fetching is enabled, there may be a slight increase in network latency for each JWT authentication request, proportional to the latency between the cluster and the issuer's endpoint. [#120063][#120063]
- [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview) cookies are marked `Secure` for the browser when the cluster is running in secure mode. [#119262][#119262]
- The [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview) `session` cookie is now marked `HttpOnly` to prevent it from being read by any Javascript code. [#119262][#119262]

<h3 id="v23-1-17-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The new [cluster setting](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `server.max_open_transactions_per_gateway`, when set to a non-negative value, prevents users without the [`admin` role ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization#admin-role) from executing a query if more than this number of [transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/transactions) are open on the current [gateway node](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction#gateway). [#118949][#118949]
- Added support for [index hinting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/table-expressions#force-index-selection) with [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/insert) and [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/upsert) statements. This allows `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` and `UPSERT` queries to use index hints in the same way as [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/update) and [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/delete) statements. [#119600][#119600]

<h3 id="v23-1-17-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- You can now pass the `--include-range-info` flag when [generating a diagnostic bundle](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cockroach-debug-zip) to include problem ranges. [#119233][#119233]
- In unredacted diagnostic bundles, two columns have been added to the `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` table:
    - `waiting_stmt_query`: the query of the statement that is waiting to run.
    - `blocking_txn_queries_unordered`: an unordered list of the blocking transaction's queries.

    [#119422][#119422]

<h3 id="v23-1-17-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**Statements** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-statements-page) now always shows the entire selected period, instead of only the period that contains data. [#118811][#118811]
- The [**Overload Dashboard**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overload-dashboard) page now includes two additional graphs:
    - **Elastic CPU Utilization**: Shows the actual CPU used for elastic work compared with the configured limit.
    - **Elastic CPU Exhausted Duration Per Second**: Shows how much time, in milliseconds, that elastic work has been subject to CPU exhaustion. [#118908][#118908]

<h3 id="v23-1-17-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where creating a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview) that targeted tables with a zero-scale [`DECIMAL(n)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/decimal) column, `format='avro'`, and `diff` would cause a panic. [#118848][#118848]
- Fixed a bug where a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview.html) could omit events in rare cases, logging the error `cdc ux violation: detected timestamp ... that is less or equal to the local frontier`. This could happen in the following scenario:
    1. A [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) runs on a follower [replica](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/glossary#cockroachdb-architecture-terms) that lags significantly behind the [leaseholder](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/glossary#cockroachdb-architecture-terms).
    1. A transaction commits and removes its [transaction record](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/transaction-layer#transaction-records) before its [intent](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/transaction-layer#writing) resolution is applied on the follower.
    1. The follower's [closed timestamp](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/transaction-layer#closed-timestamps) has advanced past the transaction commit timestamp.
    1. The rangefeed attempts to push the transaction to a new timestamp (at least 10 seconds after the transaction began).
    1. This may cause the rangefeed to prematurely emit a checkpoint before emitting writes at lower timestamps, which in turn may cause the [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview#how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work) to drop these events entirely, never emitting them.

    [#118415][#118415]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.2 where queries issued by [TTL jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/row-level-ttl#view-scheduled-ttl-jobs) did not use optimal plans. [#118496][#118496]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1.0 where a [decommissioning](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/node-shutdown?filters=decommission#decommission-the-node) replica that is part of a mis-replicated range could get stuck on a rebalance operation that was falsely determined to be unsafe. [#118437][#118437]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.2 where adding multiple columns with [`UNIQUE` constraints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/unique) in a single statement could result in the error `secondary index for backfill contains physical column not present in source primary index`. [#118137][#118137]
- Fixed a bug where an `unable to get CPU capacity` error could be logged every 10 seconds when running outside of a CPU `cgroup`. [#118670][#118670]
- Fixed a bug where an [`AUTO CREATE STATS` job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-jobs#show-automatic-jobs) could cause an internal system table to grow, and this could cause slow queries related to the job system. [#118944][#118944]
- Fixed a bug that caused a confusing error when a sequence name allocated by [`SERIAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/serial) conflicted with an existing type name. [#118948][#118948]
- Fixed a bug where an [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/alter-table#alter-primary-key) query could fail with the error `non-nullable column {x} with no value! Index scanned ..` when validating a recreated [secondary index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/indexes). [#118972][#118972]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that could cause the internal error `attempting to append refresh spans after the tracked timestamp has moved forward` to be logged in some cases when using virtual tables such as`crdb_internal.system_jobs`. [#119186][#119186]
- Fixed a bug in the `crdb_internal.leases` table where a deadlock in the leasing system could cause a node to become unavailable. [#119374][#119374]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1.15 where a [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-and-configure-changefeeds#enable-rangefeeds)-resolved timestamp could get stuck after a [range merge](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/distribution-layer#range-merges) if the range cache thinks the barrier spans multiple ranges. The log message `pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split` is constantly emitted. [#119543][#119543]
- Fixed a rare panic that could happen during a [`pg_dump` import](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/import) that contains a subquery in one of its arguments, such as a function like `SELECT addgeometrycolumn(...)`. Now, attempting to import a `pg_dump` with a function that has a subquery in one of its arguments results in an error rather than a panic. [#118611][#118611]
- Fixed a bug in the [webhook sink](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/changefeed-sinks#webhook-sink) where the `http` request body may not be initialized on retries, resulting in the error `http: ContentLength=... with Body length 0`. [#119495][#119495]
- Fixed a bug where some files were not closed when inspecting backup metadata during [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/backup) and [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/restore) operations. [#119634][#119634]
- Fixed a bug that could cause internal errors to be logged when executing an [`EXPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/export) statement. [#119712][#119712]
- Fixed a bug where a [schema change](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/online-schema-changes) with a large number of descriptors could perform a [full table scan](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-full-table-scans) on the `system.leases` table. [#119466][#119466]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.1.0 that could cause the `sql.txns.open.internal` and `sql.statements.active.internal` gauge metrics never to be updated, leading to an incorrect count of the number of transactions and statements executed by operations internal to CockroachDB. These metrics do not include operations executed by external SQL clients. [#119338][#119338]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.2.9 that could cause a slow memory leak that can accumulate when opening many new connections. [#120244][#120244]
