- The cluster setting `server.jwt_authentication.issuers` can now take multiple values to support various kinds of providers and their mapped JWKS URI. This can be set to one of the following values: 1. Simple string that Go can parse as a valid issuer URL. 2. String that can be parsed as valid JSON array of issuer URLs list. 3. String that can be parsed as valid JSON and deserialized into a map of issuer URLs to corresponding JWKS URIs. In the third case we will be overriding the JWKS URI present in the issuer's well-known endpoint. Example valid values: - 'https://accounts.google.com' - ['example.com/adfs','https://accounts.google.com'] - '{    "issuer_jwks_map": {        "https://accounts.google.com": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs",        "example.com/adfs": "https://example.com/adfs/discovery/keys"     }    }' When `issuer_jwks_map` is set, we directly use the JWKS URI to get the key set. In all other cases where JWKSAutoFetchEnabled is set we obtain the JWKS URI first from issuer's well-known endpoint and then use this endpoint. [#128669][#128669]

<h3 id="v23-1-26-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- There are now structured logging events that report connection breakage during node shutdown. Previously, these logs existed but were unstructured. These logs appear in the OPS logging channel. There are two new events: - The node_shutdown_connection_timeout event is logged after the timeout   defined by server.shutdown.connections.timeout transpires, if there   are still open SQL connections. - The node_shutdown_transaction_timeout event is logged after the   timeout defined by server.shutdown.transactions.timeout transpires, if   there are still open transactions on those SQL connections.

<h3 id="v23-1-26-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fix a bug in which output of `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT)` of various CREATE statements was not redacted. This bug has existed since `EXPLAIN (REDACT)` was introduced in v23.1 and affects the following statements: - `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT) CREATE TABLE` - `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT) CREATE VIEW` - `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT) CREATE FUNCTION` [#128487][#128487]
- A bug has been fixed that could produce incorrect values for virtual computed columns in rare cases. The bug only presented when the virtual column expression's type did not match the type of the virtual column. [#129008][#129008]
- A bug has been fixed that caused errors like "ERROR: column 'crdb_internal_idx_expr' does not exist" when accessing a table with an expression index where the expression evaluates to an ENUM type, e.g., `CREATE INDEX ON t ((col::an_enum))`. [#129091][#129091]
- Fixed a bug existing since v23.1 that prevented naming UDT parameters when dropping a user-defined function (or procedure). [#115906][#115906]
- Fixed a slow-building memory leak when using kerberos authentication. [#130320][#130320]
