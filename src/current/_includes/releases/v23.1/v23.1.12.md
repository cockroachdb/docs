## v23.1.12

Release Date: November 13, 2023

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-1-12-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The `SIGHUP` signal now clears the cached expiration times for [client certificates]({% link v23.1/cockroach-cert.md %}#how-security-certificates-work) that are reported by the `security.certificate.expiration.client` metric. [#111006][#111006]
- SQL commands that were previously limited to the `admin` [system privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization#supported-privileges) can now be used by users with the `VIEWCLUSTERMETADATA` or `REPAIRCLUSTERMETADATA` system privilege, depending on whether the operation is read-only or modifies state. [#111131][#111131]

<h3 id="v23-1-12-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The maximum permitted value of the `COCKROACH_RPC_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` environment variable has been increased to `64MB`. By increasing this environment variable, in conjunction with tuning OS-level maximum TCP window size, you can increase the throughput that [Raft replication](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/replication-layer#raft) can sustain over high latency network links. [#111287][#111287]
- Updated Go version to 1.19.13. [#112204][#112204]

<h3 id="v23-1-12-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- New datetime built-ins (`make_date`, `make_timestamp`, and `make_timestamptz`) have been added, allowing for the creation of timestamps, timestamps with time zones, and dates. In addition, `date_trunc` now allows for a timestamp to be truncated in a specified timezone (to a specified precision). [#110338][#110338]
- New system privileges `CREATEROLE`, `CREATELOGIN`, `CREATEDB`, and `CONTROLJOB` have been introduced. Each is analogous to its existing [role option]({% link v23.1/create-user.md %}#role-options) counterpart but can additionally be inherited through role membership. [#110359][#110359], [#110359][#110359], [#110359][#110359], [#110359][#110359]
- [`RESTORE`]({% link v23.1/restore.md %}) can now be passed a `WITH EXECUTION LOCALITY` option similar to `BACKUP` to restrict execution of the job to nodes with matching localities. [#110611][#110611]
- The `statement_activity` and `transaction_activity` table column `execution_total_cluster_seconds` is now accurate. The `combinedstmts` endpoint returns the correct value for the `StmtsTotalRuntimeSecs` and `TxnsTotalRuntimeSecs` properties. [#109639][#109639]
- The `discard` [log message]({% link v23.1/logging-overview.md %}) is now limited to once per minute by default. The message now includes both the number of transactions and the number of statements that were discarded. [#110983][#110983]

<h3 id="v23-1-12-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach debug zip`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cockroach-debug-zip.md) command now has an option to omit goroutine stack dumps. This impacts the creation of `nodes/*/stacks.txt` and `nodes/*/stacks_with_labels.txt` within debug ZIP bundles. Users can opt to exclude these goroutine stacks by using the `--include-goroutine-stacks=false` flag.  Fetching stack traces for all goroutines is a "stop-the-world" operation, which can momentarily but significantly increase SQL service latency. Any periodic goroutine dumps previously taken on the node will still be included in `nodes/*/goroutines/*.txt.gz`, since they have already been generated and don't require any stop-the-world operations. [#110266][#110266]
- Requests for database details or table details from the UI, or usages of `SHOW RANGES WITH DETAILS` are no longer subject to errors if the number of requested spans is too large. [#109902][#109902]
- Added a new [metric]({% link v23.1/metrics.md %}) `changefeed.lagging_ranges` that shows the number of [ranges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/overview#architecture-range) which are behind in changefeeds. This metric can be used with the [`metrics_label` changefeed option]({% link v23.1/create-changefeed.md %}#options). The calculation of this metric is controlled by two new [cluster settings]({% link v23.1/cluster-settings.md %}): (1) `lagging_ranges_threshold`, with a default of 3 minutes, is the amount of time a range needs to be behind to be considered lagging, and (2) `lagging_ranges_polling_interval`, with a default of 1 minute, controls how often the lagging ranges calculation is done. Note that polling adds latency to the metric being updated. For example, if a range falls behind by 3 minutes, the metric may not update until an additional minute afterwards. Also note that ranges undergoing an initial scan for longer than the threshold are considered to be lagging. Starting a changefeed with an initial scan on a large table will likely increment the metric for each range in the table. However, as ranges complete the initial scan, the number of lagging ranges will decrease. [#110963][#110963]
- The [DB Console]({% link v23.1/ui-overview.md %}) now constructs client-side requests using relative URLs instead of absolute ones. This enables proxying of the DB Console at arbitrary subpaths. [#111652][#111652]
- Added a new [cluster setting]({% link v23.1/cluster-settings.md %}) `server.http.base_path` that controls the redirection of the browser after successful login with [OIDC SSO]({% link v23.1/sso-db-console.md %}). Most users do not need to modify this setting. However, it is helpful in cases where CockroachDB is running behind a load balancer or proxy that serves CockroachDB under a subpath, such as `https:// <hostname>/crdb/ `. In those cases, it is necessary for the browser to redirect to `/ crdb` after login instead of `/`, which has always been the hard-coded default.[#112038][#112038]

<h3 id="v23-1-12-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Non-admin users can now view the [**Database**, **Database Details**, and **Database table** pages]({% link v23.1/ui-databases-page.md %}). [#110342][#110342]
- The [SQL Connection Rate metric]({% link v23.1/ui-sql-dashboard.md %}#sql-connection-rate) on the [SQL Dashboard]({% link v23.1/ui-sql-dashboard.md %}) is downsampled using the MAX function instead of SUM. This improves situations where zooming out would cause the connection rate to increase for downsampled data. [#110497][#110497]
- Fixed a bug in DB Console's [Statement Diagnostic page]({% link cockroachcloud/statements-page.md %}#diagnostics) that could cause the page to crash if the response was larger than 50 KB. The page now keeps pulling results until no maximum size errors are encountered. [#111278][#111278]
- Fixed an error on the [SQL Activity page]({% link v23.1/ui-overview.md %}#sql-activity) when there was a workload, and then the workload stopped so that no queries ran against the database in the last hour. [#111496][#111496]
- The [**Jobs** table]({% link v23.1/ui-jobs-page.md %}) will now correctly display timestamps for creation, last modified, and the completed time fields. [#111901][#111901]
- The `Reset Sql Stats` button is now visible to users with the admin role on the DB Console. [#110256][#110256]
- Reduced memory usage in [SQL activity]({% link cockroachcloud/statements-page.md %}) jobs. [#112323][#112323]

<h3 id="v23-1-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The new backup option `updates_cluster_monitoring_metrics` tracks the timestamp of the last backup failure due to a KMS error. This option is disabled by default. [#111310][#111310]
- Fixed a bug where vectorized `COPY FROM` could produce a plan with more than one RenderNodes, when only zero or one should be allowed. This could result in multiple render nodes in a table with a hash sharded primary key. [#111412][#111412]
- Fixed a bug that caused CockroachDB to stop collecting new statistics about [Statement fingerprints]({% link v23.1/ui-statements-page.md %}#statement-fingerprint-page) and [Transaction fingerprints]({% link v23.1/ui-transactions-page.md %}). [#111641][#111641]
- Fixed a bug where, internally, printing a 0 decimal with a very low exponent uses excessive memory. The [DECIMAL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/decimal.md) type type is not impacted, but `crdb_internal` functions may be. [#110564][#110564]
- Fixed a bug where executing the [`EXPORT INTO PARQUET`]({% link v23.1/export.md %}#export-a-table-into-parquet) statement could cause an [out-of-memory crash (OOM)]({% link v23.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.md %}#out-of-memory-oom-crash). Now, if memory is exceeded, the `EXPORT INTO PARQUET` statement returns an error. If you see an error related to memory, retry the `EXPORT INTO PARQUET` statement using a smaller value for the [`chunk_rows` option]({% link v23.1/export.md %}#export-options). Cockroach Labs [recommends using changefeeds to export data]({% link v23.1/export-data-with-changefeeds.md %}) because they provide better performance for growing workloads. Additionally, changefeeds [operate as jobs]({% link v23.1/show-jobs.md %}), which offer [observability]({% link v23.1/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md %}) and [job management]({% link v23.1/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md %}). [#110717][#110717] [#110717][#110717]
- Added limited `statement_statistics` to the `debug.zip` output. [#110662][#110662]
- Fixed a nil dereference panic during node startup that could be caused by an incorrect initialization order. [#109684][#109684]
- Fixed a bug where the [`BEGIN` statement]({% link v23.1/begin-transaction.md %}) incorrectly displayed a transaction ID in telemetry logs. It now correctly shows no transaction ID, since there is no open transaction when `BEGIN` is executed.[#109840][#109840]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a transaction performing multiple parallel foreign key checks to return a `concurrent txn use detected` error. [#109849][#109849]
- Fixed a bug where dependencies on sequences from tables would be reported with the wrong value for the `classid` column in the `pg_catalog.pg_depend` table. [#110207][#110207]
- Fixed edge cases in decimal and float evaluation for division operators. `'NaN'::DECIMAL / 0` will now return `NaN` instead of a division-by-zero error, and `0 / 'inf'::DECIMAL` will return `0` instead of `0E-2019`. [#110296][#110296]
- Fixed a DB Console issue where the `DROP_UNUSED` index recommendations produced by the table details page produced an invalid `DROP INDEX` statement. [#110453][#110453]
- Executing two [`ALTER RANGE default CONFIGURE ZONE`]({% link v23.1/alter-range.md %}#configure-zone) statements on the same line no longer triggers an error. [#110337][#110337]
- Removed a buggy TTL descriptor repair. Previously, upgrading from v22.2.x to 23.1.9 incorrectly removed [TTL storage parameters]({% link v23.1/row-level-ttl.md %}#ttl-storage-parameters) from tables (visible via [`SHOW CREATE TABLE  <ttl-table>`]({% link v23.1/show-create.md %})) while attempting to repair table descriptors. A node that attempts to run the TTL [job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-jobs.html) could crash due to a panic caused by the missing TTL storage parameters. Clusters currently on v22.2.x should **not** be upgraded to v23.1.9, but should move directly to v23.1.10 or later. For more information, refer to [Technical Advisory 110363](../advisories/a110363.html). [#110500][#110500]
- Fixed a performance regression when disabling `sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled`, which caused execution stats to be collected for all queries instead of the default 1% of queries. [#109881][#109881]
- `cockroach debug pebble` commands now work correctly with encrypted stores which don't use the default `cockroach-data` path, and you no longer need to pass the `--store` option. [#110507][#110507]
- The [**Database** pages]({% link cockroachcloud/databases-page.md %}) no longer displays `undefined` regions or outdated node information. [#110741][#110741]
- Fixed a bug where `RESET (ttl_expire_after)` could incorrectly remove `ttl_expiration_expression`. [#110746][#110746]
- Fixed a bug where an [`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT CHECK ...`]({% link v23.1/alter-table.md %}#add-constraint) statement with a user-defined function (UDF) in the `CHECK` could cause a validation error. [#110720][#110720]
- Fixed a bug where `CREATE INDEX` for [partial indexes]({% link v23.1/partial-indexes.md %}) could fail with `ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint` if concurrent inserts happened simultaneously. [#110584][#110584]
- Fixed a bug where a [`CREATE TABLE`]({% link v23.1/create-table.md %}) command with an `IDENTITY` column did not properly propagate the type of the column into the sequence. [#111014][#111014]
- Fixed a bug where the `format_type` built-in did not honor `typemod` information for array types, leading to incorrect output. [#110940][#110940]
- Fixed compaction behavior to prevent rapid sublevel growth when removing replicas from a store, such as during decommissioning. [#111141][#111141]
- Fixed a bug that could occur when the [multiple active portals]({% link v23.1/postgresql-compatibility.md %}#multiple-active-portals) execution mode (Preview) was enabled to evaluate queries such as lookup joins. The bug could result in an internal error like `unexpected 40960 leftover bytes` if the portal was not fully consumed. [#110666][#110666]
- External connection URLs now accept the scheme `azure-blob` for connections to Azure Blob Storage and the scheme `azure-kms` for connections to Azure KMS. For backward compatibility, schemes `azure` and `azure-storage` schemes continue to work for connections to Azure Blob Storage. [#111246][#111246]
- Fixed a bug where changing the setting `server.telemetry.hot_ranges_stats.interval` had no effect. [#111373][#111373]
- Added a check for values before using `mean` on the DB Console [Plan Details page]({% link v23.1/ui-statements-page.md %}), fixing a crash. [#111505][#111505]
- Fixed a bug where dependencies on sequences from tables would be reported with the wrong value for the `classid` column in the `pg_catalog.pg_depend` table. [#111600][#111600]
- Fixed a bug where `atttypmod` in `pg_attribute` was not populated for [`TIMESTAMP`]({% link v23.1/timestamp.md %}) / [`INTERVAL`]({% link v23.1/interval.md %}) types, which meant that ORMs could not know the precision of these types properly. [#111727][#111727]
- Fixed a bug in the DB Console [Transaction Insight Details]({% link v23.1/ui-insights-page.md %}) page , which showed  contention details of other transactions. Now, CockroachDB will only surface contention details for the current transaction. [#111880][#111880]
- Fixed a bug where `indoption` inside `pg_index` was not properly encoded. Clients were unable to decode it as `int2vector`. [#111957][#111957]
- RPC failures on writes now use the parallel commit protocol and execute in parallel to the commit operation. This change prevents incorrect retryable failures and `transaction unexpectedly committed` assertions by detecting when writes cannot be retried idempotently, instead returning an `AmbiguousResultError`. [#111876][#111876]
- Fixed a bug that prevented the [optimizer]({% link v23.1/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) from honoring the `statement_timeout` session setting when generating constrained index scans for queries with large `IN` lists or `= ANY` predicates on multiple index key columns. This bug could cause an Out-of-Memory (OOM) condition on the node. [#112076][#112076]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors during query optimization in rare cases. The bug has been present since version v2.1.11, but it is more likely to occur in version v21.2.0 and later, though it is still rare. The bug only presents when a query contains `min` and `max` [aggregate functions]({% link v23.1/functions-and-operators.md %}#aggregate-functions) [#112254][#112254]
- Fixed a bug  where a lookup or index join on a table with at least three column families could be evaluated incorrectly, leading to a "non-nullable column with no value" error or incorrect query results. The bug was introduced in v22.2. [#113107][#113107]
- Fixed a bug that could cause internal errors or panics while attempting to forecast statistics on a numeric column. [#113881][#113881]
