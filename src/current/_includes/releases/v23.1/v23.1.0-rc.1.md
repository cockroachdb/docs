## v23.1.0-rc.1

Release Date: May 2, 2023

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-1-0-rc-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Two views have been added to the [`crdb_internal` system catalog](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/crdb-internal): `crdb_internal.statement_activity` surfaces data in the persisted `system.statement_activity` table, and `crdb_internal.transaction_activity` surfaces the `system.transaction_activity` table. [#102047][#102047]
- Span statistics are now unavailable on mixed-version clusters. [#101878][#101878]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-rc-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Timestamps are now displayed in DB Console in the timezone specified in the `ui.display_timezone` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings), if set. Currently supported timezones are `Coordinated Universal Time` and `America/New_York`. [#102241][#102241]
- DB Console now limits historical data for SQL Activity pages to 200000 rows by default, based on the new `sql.stats.activity.persisted_rows.max` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings). A background job automatically prunes the system tables `transaction_activity` and `statement_activity`. [#101995][#101995]
- Improved performance when viewing the [`crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` table](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/crdb-internal) in DB Console if there are a large number of rows. [#101871][#101871]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced prior to v22.1 where an `EXPORT` statement could be incorrectly evaluated and result in a node panic or incorrect query results if it had projection or rendering on top of the `EXPORT`, such as the statement `WITH cte AS (EXPORT INTO CSV 'nodelocal://1/export1/' FROM SELECT * FROM t) SELECT filename FROM cte;`. Only the presentation of the query result was affected, not the exported data. [#101806][#101806]
- The descriptions of the `rebalancing.readbytespersecond` and `rebalancing.writebytespersecond` metrics now correctly reference bytes read and bytes written, respectively. [#101710][#101710]
- Fixed a rare bug introduced prior to v22.1 where distributed plans could cause the graceful drain of a node to become stuck retrying forever during [node shutdown](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/node-shutdown). This bug leads to errors like `drain details: distSQL execution flows:`, together with a non-zero number of flows that is not reducing over a long period of time. [#101884][#101884]
- Fixed a bug where a [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/restore) operation with `skip_localities_check` could fail with errors if regions were missing on a cluster. [#101798][#101798]
- Fixed a bug introduced in testing releases of v23.1 that could cause incorrect results for queries with `STRICT` [user-defined functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/user-defined-functions). [#101951][#101951]
- Fixed a rare bug that could cause keys to be unexpectedly deleted locally within a store by replica rebalancing during a write heavy workload. [#102166][#102166]
- Fixed a bug where a failed or cancelled [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/import) operation could leave some of the imported rows behind after it was cancelled, if the writing processes were slow enough to continue writing after the cleanup process started. [#102246][#102246]
- Fixed a bug in the behavior of the `enforce_home_region` [session variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/set-vars) that may have allowed a hash join to be favored over a lookup join, or failed to error out remote accesses done by uniqueness checks for mutations on [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/regional-tables). [#102287][#102287]
- Fixed a bug introduced in testing releases of v23.1 where a node could crash when evaluating a [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/copy-from) command when the schema had `INT2` or `INT4` type. [#102307][#102307]
- Fixed a bug where a backup of a key's revision history may not correctly be restored to the proper revision of the key if it is split across multiple sorted string tables. [#102342][#102342]
- Fixed a bug introduced in testing releases of v23.1 where a user could be prevented from logging in or viewing or changing [`GRANT`s](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/grant) if the cluster had a long period of inactivity. [#102488][#102488]
- Fixed a bug where a node that transferred a lease away and missed a liveness heartbeat could then erroneously update the closed timestamp during the stasis period of its liveness. This could lead to closed timestamp invariant violation and could cause the node to crash. In extreme cases, this could lead to inconsistencies in read-only queries. [#102602][#102602]
- Fixed a bug that caused memory leaks when a closed or cancelled connection was released. [#101810][#101810]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-rc-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- [SQL Activity](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-sql-dashboard) dashboards now default to using a table optimized with the top data for the most used cases. Otherwise, they use persisted data if available, and in-memory data otherwise. [#102310][#102310]
- Static erroring of some locality-optimized lookup [joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/joins) is now handled dynamically during query execution. [#102287][#102287]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-rc-1-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- Two new statistics help to track the efficiency of snapshot transfers and to keep the number of failures due to system-level races as low as possible. `range.snapshots.recv-failed` shows the number of snapshot send attempts that are initiated but not accepted by the recipient. `range.snapshots.recv-unusable` shows the number of snapshots that were fully transmitted but not used. [#101835][#101835]
