## v23.1.15

Release Date: February 20, 2024

<h3 id="v23-1-15-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview) `session` cookie is now marked `HttpOnly` to prevent it from being read by any Javascript code and is marked `Secure` by the browser when the cluster operates in secure mode. [#119248][#119248]

<h3 id="v23-1-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview) that targeted schema-locked tables could fail due to an old high-water timestamp being incorrectly persisted. [#117960][#117960]
- Fixed a bug where creating a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview) that targeted tables with a `DECIMAL(n)` column (that is, zero-scale [`DECIMAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/decimal) column), `format='avro'`, and `diff` would cause a panic. [#118893][#118893]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a [`CREATE CHANGEFEED WITH {key_column}`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-changefeed) statement to retry forever. [#116966][#116966]
- Fixed a bug that prevented database [restore](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/restore) when the database contained a view or routine that referenced a user-defined type in the body string. For views, this bug was introduced in v20.2 when UDTs were introduced. For routines, this bug was introduced in v22.2 when UDFs were introduced. [#116903][#116903]
- Fixed a durability issue in the Raft log storage mechanism due to improper synchronization of filesystem metadata, potentially leading to the loss of specific write operations (`AddSSTable`), notably utilized by operations such as `RESTORE`. This vulnerability was exposed only under conditions of power failure or operating system crashes, potentially causing CockroachDB to enter a crash loop upon restart. In extreme scenarios, such as a simultaneous power outage or crash across multiple nodes, it could result in an irrecoverable quorum loss. [#117383][#117383]
- Fixed an issue in Raft log truncation that had the potential to cause crash loops and irretrievable quorum loss, especially in the rare but severe scenario where all replicas concurrently enter a crash loop. This issue emerged under conditions where the cluster was processing a bulk write operation (such as schema changes, imports, or restores), while a log truncation command was active, and the CockroachDB process experienced a crash. [#117299][#117299]
- Fixed the total runtime value referenced in SQL stats, resolving the bug where the [Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview) erroneously displayed percentages over 100%. [#117496][#117496]
- Fixed an issue where the values for the current and past hour in the top Activity table were calculated incorrectly, causing a missing data issue in SQL stats and, consequently, on the [SQL Activity](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview#sql-activity) page. [#118427][#118427]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would erroneously return an error if an empty search path parameter was encountered during search path setting. [#117556][#117556]
- Fixed a bug in the [Row-Level TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/row-level-ttl) job that would cause it to skip expired rows if the primary key of the table included columns of the collated string type. This bug was present since the initial release of row-level TTL in v22.2.0. [#117513][#117513]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/delete) queries sent by the [Row-Level TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/row-level-ttl) job to use a secondary index rather than the primary index to find the rows to delete. This could lead to some `DELETE` operations taking a much longer time than they should. This bug was present since v22.2.0. [#118336][#118336]
- Fixed a bug where concurrent [`GRANT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/grant) statements can cause deadlocks. [#117712][#117712]
- Reduced the impact of bulk deletions ([`DROP TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/drop-table), [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/truncate), or replica removals) on foreground traffic by altering storage engine compaction priorities. [#116560][#116560]
- Resolved an issue where DML operations would fail during the creation of a hash-sharded index, resulting in an error stating column `crdb_internal_val_shard_16` does not exist. This bug was present since v23.1.0. [#118238][#118238]
- [`AUTO CREATE STATS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-jobs#show-automatic-jobs) jobs no longer lead to growth in an internal system table resulting in slower job-system related queries. [#118980][#118980]
- [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/alter-table#alter-primary-key) no longer fail with an `non-nullable column <x> with no value! Index scanned ..` error when validating recreated secondary indexes. [#118969][#118969]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could encounter an error `unable to encode table key: *tree.DTSQuery` when operating on columns of [`TSQuery`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/tsquery) type in some contexts (e.g. when collecting table statistics or when performing a `DISTINCT` operation). The bug has been present since 23.1 when support for TSQuery type was added. [#118320][#118320]
- Fixed a bug where in some cases CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate queries that scanned an inverted index and had a `WHERE` filter in which two sides of the `AND` expression had "similar" expressions (e.g. `ARRAY['str1'] <@ col AND (ARRAY['str1'] && col OR ...)`). The bug has been present since pre-22.2 version. [#118359][#118359]
- CockroachDB now correctly logs the top 5 hot ranges per cluster instead of per node. [#118371][#118371]
- Fixed a bug where a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview) could omit events in rare cases, logging the error `cdc ux violation: detected timestamp ... that is less or equal to the local frontier`. This can happen if a [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-and-configure-changefeeds#enable-rangefeeds) runs on a follower replica that lags significantly behind the leaseholder, a transaction commits and removes its transaction record before its intent resolution is applied on the follower, the follower's closed timestamp has advanced past the transaction commit timestamp, and the rangefeed attempts to push the transaction to a new timestamp (at least 10 seconds after the transaction began). This may cause the rangefeed to prematurely emit a checkpoint before emitting writes at lower timestamps, which in turn may cause the changefeed to drop these events entirely, never emitting them.
