## v23.1.3

Release Date: June 13, 2023

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
A [bug](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/104798) was discovered in a change included in v23.1.3 (this release). This bug can affect clusters upgrading to v23.1.3 from [v22.2.x]({% link releases/v22.2.md %}). In an affected cluster, jobs that were running during the upgrade could hang or fail to run after the upgrade is finalized. Users upgrading from v22.2.x are advised to use [v23.1.2](#v23-1-2) to upgrade, or to set the [`cluster.preserve_downgrade_option`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/upgrade-cockroach-version#step-3-decide-how-the-upgrade-will-be-finalized) cluster setting to delay finalization of the upgrade until they can upgrade to v23.1.4.

<h3 id="v23-1-3-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The new `server.client_cert_expiration_cache.capacity` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) allows you to configure the minimum time until a user's set of client certificates will expire. When `server.client_cert_expiration_cache.capacity` is set to a non-zero value, the new metric `security.certificate.expiration.client` tracks the number of client certificates that have expired. [#104165][#104165]

<h3 id="v23-1-2-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Role-based audit logging is now an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} feature. Only {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} users will be able to configure role-based audit logging using the `sql.log.user_audit` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings). [#104453][#104453]
- The new `sql.log.user_audit` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) enables role-based auditing. When the setting is enabled, you can set an audit logging configuration using a table-like syntax. Each row in the configuration represents an _audit setting_ in the configuration. An audit setting is comprised of the following columns: `USER/ROLE` and `STATEMENT_FILTER`:

    ~~~sql
    SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.log.user_audit = '
        test_role       ALL
        another_role    NONE
        ALL             NONE
    ';
    ~~~

     [#104179][#104179]
- Introduced the `sql.log.user_audit.reduced_config.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings). When enabled, this cluster setting computes a "reduced" [audit configuration](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/eventlog#role_based_audit_event) based on the user's current role memberships and the current value for the `sql.log.user_audit` cluster setting. The "reduced" audit configuration is computed at the **first SQL event emit by the user, after the setting is enabled**. When the cluster setting is enabled, CockroachDB can compute the audit configuration once at session start, which provides around a 5% increase in throughput. However, changes to the audit configuration (user role memberships or cluster setting configuration) are not reflected within a session. A new session should be started to reflect the configuration changes in auditing behavior. [#104372][#104372]


<h3 id="v23-1-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- When the `sql.trace.stmt.enable_threshold` or `sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold` [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) is enabled, the logging output is now emitted on the [`SQL_EXEC` channel](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/logging#sql_exec). Previously, this was emitted to the [`DEV` channel](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/logging#dev). [#104047][#104047]
- [`SHOW GRANTS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-grants) now lists privileges inherited by role membership. `SHOW GRANTS ON ROLE` statements no longer require any privileges and also lists implicit grantees. [#104587][#104587]

<h3 id="v23-1-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The new [metric](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/metrics) `leases.liveness` shows the number of [liveness range](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/configure-replication-zones#create-a-replication-zone-for-a-system-range) leases per node to track the liveness range leaseholder. [#104076][#104076]
- The new a gauge metric `sql.conns_waiting_to_hash` counts the number of connection attempts that are being limited due to the number of concurrent password hashing operations. This behavior has been present since v21.2 to [prevent password hashing from increasing CPU load](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/query-behavior-troubleshooting#high-client-cpu-load-connection-pool-exhaustion-or-increased-connection-latency-when-scram-password-based-authentication-is-enabled). The metric is expected to be `0`, or close to `0`, in a healthy setup. If the metric is consistently high and connection latencies are high, then an operator should do one or more of the following:
    - Ensure applications using the cluster have properly configured [connection pools](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/connection-pooling).
    - Add more vCPU or more nodes to the cluster.
    - Increase the password hashing concurrency using the `COCKROACH_MAX_PW_HASH_COMPUTE_CONCURRENCY` [environment variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cockroach-commands#environment-variables). [#104388][#104388]

<h3 id="v23-1-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added merge queue failure and merge queue processing time metrics to the [**Queue Processing Failures**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-queues-dashboard#queue-processing-failures) and [**Queue Processing Times**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-queues-dashboard#queue-processing-times) graphs respectively. [#104034][#104034]
- Removed the **Circuit Breaker Tripped Events** graph from the [**Replication**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-replication-dashboard) dashboard. [#104038][#104038]
- Added **Completed time** to [**Jobs**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-jobs-page) and [**Job details**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-jobs-page#job-details) pages, and updated the time format on those pages to include seconds and milliseconds. [#104063][#104063]
- Added a **Created SQL Connections** chart on the [**SQL**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-sql-dashboard) dashboard under **Metrics**. [#104072][#104072]
- Added **Ranges in Catchup Mode** and **Rangefeed Catchup Scans Duration** charts to the [**Changefeeds**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-cdc-dashboard) dashboard. [#104122][#104122]
- The sort setting on the [**Hot Ranges**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-hot-ranges-page) page is now persisted across page reloads and navigation. [#104112][#104112]
- The [**Databases**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-databases-page) page now supports a large number of tables for a single database. If more than 40 tables are present in a database, the sort on the page will be disabled; however, it is still possible to filter by table name. [#103854][#103854]
- On the **Statement Details** page, renamed the "Idle Latency" metric to "Client Wait Time" and separated it into its own chart. [#103915][#103915]
- Added more search criteria options on the [**SQL Activity**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview#sql-activity) page:
    - For the **Top** dropdown: `1000`, `5000`, and `10000`.
    - For the **By** dropdown on the **Statements** tab: Last Execution Time, Max Latency, Max Memory, Min Latency, Network, P50 Latency, P90 Latency, Retries, and Rows Processed.
    - For the **By** dropdown on the **Transactions** tab: Max Memory, Network, Retries, and Rows Processed. [#104054][#104054]
- Added a new link to the **Range Status** page on the [**Replication**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-replication-dashboard) dashboard that opens the **Enqueue Ranges** page with the node ID already completed. [#104100][#104100]
- The DB Console will no longer show `DROP INDEX` recommendations for unique indexes. [#104287][#104287]
- On the **Transactions** tab of the [**SQL Activity**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview#sql-activity) page, the **Status** will be `Idle` if the executing transaction is not currently executing a statement. Previously, the status would be `Executing`. [#103925][#103925]
- Fixed the job that updates the `statement_activity` and `transaction_activity` tables on the [**SQL Activity**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview#sql-activity) page. The table size is now constrained when there are a lot of unique queries. This fix helps to prevent slowing down the **SQL Activity** page. [#104340][#104340]

<h3 id="v23-1-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a panic that could occur while a [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/copy-from) statement is logged for telemetry purposes. [#103848][#103848]
- Fixed a bug where disk space used by deleted and [garbage collected](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/storage-layer#garbage-collection) data would not be reclaimed in a timely manner, especially when a store has low-write workload. [#103865][#103865]
- Fixed a problem that could lead to erroneously refused lease transfers, causing the following error message: `refusing to transfer lease to [...] because target may need a Raft snapshot: replica in StateProbe`. [#103849][#103849]
- Fixed a bug where [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/copy-from) in v23.1.0 and beta versions would incorrectly encode data with multiple [column families](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/column-families). The data must be dropped and re-imported to be encoded correctly. [#103393][#103393]
- Fixed a bug where running a [`debug` command](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cockroach-commands#commands) that manipulates a store (e.g., `debug compact`) without first terminating the node using the store, could result in corruption of the node's store if encryption-at-rest was enabled. [#102877][#102877]
- Fixed a bug where [`SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-default-privileges) did not work correctly if the database name or schema name being inspected had upper-case or special characters. [#103952][#103952]
- Fixed a bug that could cause queries with [joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/joins) or [subqueries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/subqueries) to omit rows where column values are `NULL` in very rare cases. This bug was present since v20.2. [#103803][#103803]
- Fixed a bug that could cause goroutines to hang during [SCRAM authentication](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/scram-authentication). [#104197][#104197]
- The `sys.cpu.combined.percent-normalized` metric now uses `GOMAXPROCS`, if lower than the number of CPU shares when calculating CPU utilization. [#104191][#104191]
- The warning message about a missing `--advertise-addr` flag is no longer displayed when the flag is specified on server start. [#104227][#104227]
- Fixed a rare bug where stale multi-column table [statistics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cost-based-optimizer) could cause table statistics forecasts to be inaccurate, leading to un-optimal query plans. [#104229][#104229]
- Fixed a bug in v23.1.0 where the `node_id` field would be omitted from logs. The `node_id` value has now been restored to the logs. [#103798][#103798]
- Fixed a bug where the collection of `KV bytes read` and `KV gRPC calls` execution statistics during [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/explain-analyze) could be incorrect (it would remain at zero) in some cases. The bug was introduced in the v23.1.0 release. [#104194][#104194]
- Fixed an incorrect results bug in v22.2.10 and v23.1.2 and above when the `optimizer_use_improved_computed_column_filters_derivation` [session setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/set-vars) is `true`. Predicates on [computed columns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/computed-columns) are derived when an ORed predicate on a column in the computed column expression is present. [#104276][#104276]
- The [`keyvisualizer` job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-key-visualizer) no longer panics if an error is encountered while cleaning up stale samples. Instead, if the job encounters an error, the job will try again later. [#104374][#104374]
- Fixed a bug where it was possible for a SQL row to be split across two ranges. When this occurred, SQL queries could return unexpected errors. The real keys are now inspected rather than just request keys to determine load-based split points. [#103876][#103876]
- Fixed a bug which could cause a panic when a [`CREATE FUNCTION`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-function) statement used the [`setval()` built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/functions-and-operators). [#104297][#104297]
- Fixed a rare race condition that could allow large [restore](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/restore) jobs to fail with an `unable to find store` error. [#100955][#100955]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would not ignore the messages that it should, if there was an error while in the [PostgreSQL extended protocol](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/postgresql-compatibility). [#104459][#104459]
- Fixed a bug in which some [Google Cloud Platform](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/use-cloud-storage)-related errors would be returned with an uninformative error. [#104065][#104065]
- Fixed a bug where in rare cases a panic could occur during shutdown in relation to the SQL activity computation. This bug was introduced in v23.1.0. [#104515][#104515]
- The backfill of `system.job_info` upgrade migration that runs during upgrades from v22.2 now processes rows in batches to avoid cases where it could become stuck due to [contention](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/performance-best-practices-overview#transaction-contention) and transaction retries. [#104574][#104574]
- Fixes a bug in which [`SHOW BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-backup) would fail to show a [locality-aware backup](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/take-and-restore-locality-aware-backups) that contained [incremental backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups). [#103761][#103761]

<h3 id="v23-1-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- If [`transaction_rows_read_err`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/transactions#limit-the-number-of-rows-written-or-read-in-a-transaction) is set to a non-zero value, CockroachDB now ensures that any single scan never reads more than `transaction_rows_read_err` + 1 rows. This prevents transactions that would error due to the `transaction_rows_read_err` setting from causing a large performance overhead due to large scans. [#104364][#104364]
- Improved the efficiency of the an internal job that during upgrades deleted descriptors of dropped functions. Previously, the job would check every single ID until the max descriptor ID, which was particularly inefficient when this was large. Now, the job only queries the upper bound ID of each batch. [#104590][#104590]
