## v23.1.0-alpha.3

Release Date: February 21, 2023

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Added new metrics to count [paused jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/pause-job) for every job type. For example, the metric for paused changefeed jobs is `jobs.changefeed.currently_paused`. These metrics are updated at an interval defined by the cluster setting `jobs.metrics.interval.poll`, which defaults to 10 seconds. [#89752][#89752]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added support for Azure Key Vault KMS, which will allow users to [encrypt and decrypt their backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/take-and-restore-encrypted-backups#use-key-management-service) using keys stored in Azure Key Vault. App Registration authentication (Azure RBAC) for Azure Storage is also now supported.[#96459][#96459]
- Introduced a new locality filter option (`coordinator_locality`) that can be specified when a [backup job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/backup) is created. This option restricts the backup metadata writing to the designated nodes. [#95791][#95791]
- Fixed a bug that caused the server to crash if trying to restore a table from a backup generated by `BACKUP TABLE` from a schema that includes [user-defined functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/user-defined-functions), and the restore target database does not have a schema with the same name. [#96911][#96911]
- Changefeeds with the `unordered` option can use multi-region [Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/changefeed-sinks). [#96567][#96567]
- Fixed a bug in changefeeds where long running [initial scans](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-changefeed#initial-scan) will fail to generate checkpoints. Failure to generate [checkpoints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work) is particularly bad if the changefeed restarts. Without checkpoints, the changefeed will restart from the beginning, and in the worst case, when exporting substantially sized tables, the changefeed initial scan may not complete. [#96995][#96995]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added [latency information](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/statements-page#statement-statistics) in seconds to the statement statistics on `crdb_internal.statement_statistics`, `system.statement_statistics`, and `crdb_internal.cluster_statement_statistics`, with information about: `min`, `max`, `p50`, `p90`, and `p99. Also added the columns: `latency_seconds_min`, `latency_seconds_max`, `latency_seconds_p50`, `latency_seconds_p90`, and `latency_seconds_p99` to `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics`.[#96396][#96396]
- Deprecated the `PGDUMP` and `MYSQLDUMP` formats for [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/import). They are still present, but will be removed in a future release. See the [Migration Overview](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/migration-overview) page for alternatives. [#96386][#96386]
- [`COPY ... FROM ... QUOTE '"'`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/copy-from) will no longer error. [#96572][#96572]
- Added `last_error_code` column to the `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics` table. Added `last_error_code` field to the `statistics` JSON blob in the `crdb_internal.statement_statistics` and `system.statement_statistics` tables. [#96436][#96436]
- Added support for expressions of the form `COLLATE "default"`, `COLLATE "C"`, and `COLLATE "POSIX"`. Since the default [collation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/collate) cannot be changed currently, these expressions are all equivalent. The expressions are evaluated by treating the input as a normal string, and ignoring the collation.  This means that comparisons between strings and collated strings that use `"default"`, `"C"`, or `"POSIX"` are now supported.  Creating a column with the `"C"` or `"POSIX"` collations is still not supported. [#96828][#96828]
- The insights subsystem in `sqlstats` is now able to detect failed executions, regardless if they were slow or not. [#97039][#97039]
- The internal `statement_statistics` and `transaction_statistics` tables now include sampled execution statistics on storage iteration. [#96016][#96016]
- Introduced the `declare_cursor_statement_timeout_enabled` [session variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/set-vars) that disables statement timeouts during `FETCH` when using `DECLARE CURSOR`. [#96607][#96607]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- A [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/backup) that encounters too many retryable errors will now fail instead of pausing to allow subsequent backups the chance to succeed. [#96673][#96673]
- Added an option to balance CPU time (`cpu`) instead of queries per second (`qps`) among stores in a cluster. This is done by setting `kv.allocator.load_based_rebalancing.objective='cpu'`. `kv.allocator.cpu_rebalance_threshold` is also added, similar to `kv.allocator.qps_rebalance_threshold` to control the target range for store CPU above and below the cluster mean. [#96127][#96127]
- The [load-based splitter](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/load-based-splitting) now supports using request CPU usage to split ranges. This is introduced with the previous cluster setting `kv.allocator.load_based_rebalancing.objective`, which when set to `cpu`, will use request CPU usage. The threshold above which CPU usage of a range is considered for splitting is defined in the cluster setting `kv.range_split.load_cpu_threshold`, which has a default value of `250ms`. [#96128][#96128]
- Added the flag `--disable-max-offset-check` to disable node self-termination when it detects [clock skew](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/operational-faqs#what-happens-when-node-clocks-are-not-properly-synchronized) with the rest of the cluster beyond `--max-offset`. The operator assumes responsibility for ensuring that real clock skew never exceeds `--max-offset`. [#96141][#96141]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added execution insights to the [Statement Fingerprint Details](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/statements-page.html#sql-statement-fingerprints) and [Transaction Fingerprint Details](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-transactions-page#transaction-fingerprints-view) pages. [#96440][#96440]
- Transaction insights that were not found will now display a message `Insight not found`. [#96832][#96832]
- Added a waiting statement ID and fingerprint to the [Insights Transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-insights-page#transaction-executions-view) details page. Added a blocking transaction ID and fingerprint to the the [Insights Statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-insights-page#statement-executions-view) page. [#96872][#96872]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where casting a [`TIMETZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/time) to an [`ARRAY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/array) results in displaying second offsets, even if they are zero. [#96583][#96583]
- Allowed [`ALTER TABLE .. ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT .. NOT VALID`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/alter-table) and [`VALIDATE CONSTRAINT ..`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/alter-table#validate-constraints) to behave consistently with PostgreSQL. Previously, the `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` would fail and cause the whole statement to fail.[#96648][#96648]
- Resolved the [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/timestamp) to match PostgreSQL. We previously included the minute/second offset for `TIMESTAMPTZ` in certain places when casting it to [`STRING`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/string), even when they were zero. [#96833][#96833]
- Resolved using negative years instead of BC when casting a [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/timestamp) to a [`STRING`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/string). [#96833][#96833]
- Fixed the [`SHOW GRANTS FOR public`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-grants) command so it works correctly. Previously, this would return an error saying that the `public` role does not exist. [#96957][#96957]
- Statement source (square bracket) syntax is no longer allowed in [user-defined functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/user-defined-functions). Prior to this fix, using this syntax in a UDF would cause a panic. This restriction will be lifted in the future. [#96824][#96824]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The execution of multiple [`FOREIGN KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/foreign-key) and [`UNIQUE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/unique) constraint checks have been parallelized in some cases. As a result, these checks should be completed faster, particularly in multi-region environments where the checks require cross-region reads. [#96123][#96123]
