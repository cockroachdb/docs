<p>
UDFs can now also be used in Changefeed expressions (Enterprise) and <code>CHECK</code> constraints, and referenced from other objects.

<p>
By default, when granting or revoking a role from another role, the system waits until all transactions that are consulting the current set of role memberships to complete. This is done to preserve CockroachDBâ€™s default isolation level. However, the downside of this wait is that grant and revoke will take longer than the longest currently executing transaction.
<p>
In some cases, you may not care about whether concurrent transactions will immediately see the side-effects of the role grant or revoke operation, but would instead prefer that the operation finish quickly.
<p>

This allows for more efficient data retrieval by reducing the number of roundtrips required between the client and server.
<p>
Third-party tools such as <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-asyncpg">asyncpg</a> use this feature to implement efficient asynchronous communication between the PostgreSQL server and client.

It provides an efficient implementation of the PostgreSQL server binary protocol for high-performance asynchronous database applications.
<p>
Asyncpg is commonly used with ORM libraries such as SQLAlchemy to provide a simple, flexible, and efficient adapter for working with PostgreSQL databases. This makes it ideal for handling large volumes of data and scaling applications to meet demanding performance requirements.

<p>FIPS-ready CockroachDB binaries are designed for workloads that require FIPS 140-2. FIPS-ready CockroachDB delegates cryptographic operations to the OpenSSL library available on the host operating system, rather than Go's cryptographic libraries. We recommend that OpenSSL has a FIPS 140-2 certificate. FIPS mode must be enabled in the Linux kernel to ensure that FIPS 140-2 is enforced by the operating system.

<p>
Sending data locally reduces your network costs and frees up the WAN bandwidth for the important data that must be transferred

Previously, customers with multi-site deployments paid more for network bandwidth than strictly necessary due to system operations that required snapshots.  Additionally, because of congested TCP channels between regions, transferring snapshots could negatively impact user traffic and slow snapshot transfers.

<p>
This change will only apply to new clusters. Existing clusters will retain the 25-hour default when upgrading, unless you have previously overridden it with an explicit value, in which case, that value will be retained. Backups taken from clusters running versions prior to v23.1 will similarly retain the GC TTL configured when the backup was taken.

<h4 id="v23-1-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v23.1](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/upgrade-cockroach-version), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as key cluster setting changes, and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- Replaced the `cdc_prev()` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/functions-and-operators) in favor of a `cdc_prev` tuple. This is an incompatible change that may break [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/change-data-capture-overview) that use the previous `cdc_prev()` function. [#85177][#85177]
- [`SHOW RANGES FOR TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges) now includes rows for all indexes that support the table. Prior to this change, `SHOW RANGES FOR TABLE foo` was an alias for `SHOW RANGES FOR INDEX foo@primary`. This was causing confusion, as it would miss data for secondary indexes. It is still possible to filter to just the primary index using `SHOW RANGES FOR INDEX foo@primary`. The statement output now also includes the index name. [#93545][#93545]
- CockroachDB now supports sharing storage ranges across multiple indexes/tables. This behavior is not enabled by default in v23.1, but will be enabled by default in a future release. When the behavior is enabled, there will no longer be a guarantee that there is at most one SQL object (e.g., table/index/sequence/materialized view) per storage range. As a result, the columns `table_id`, `database_name`, `schema_name`, `table_name` and `index_name` in `crdb_internal.ranges` and `.ranges_no_leases` will become meaningless, since a range will no longer be attributed to a single table/index. In v23.1, the default behavior of [`SHOW RANGES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges) is retained, but you should consider setting the [`sql.show_ranges_deprecated_behavior.enabled`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings#setting-sql-show-ranges-deprecated-behavior-enabled) cluster setting to `false`. This will have the following effects that will become the defaults in a future release:

   - The aforementioned columns in the `crdb_internal` virtual tables will be removed. Existing code can use the updated output of the [`SHOW RANGES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges) statement instead, optionally using `WITH KEYS` to expose the raw start/end keys.
   - `SHOW RANGES FROM DATABASE` continues to report one row per range, but stops returning the database / schema / table / index name.
   - `SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE` continues to report one row per range, but stops returning the index name.  Suggested replacements:
      - Instead of: `SELECT range_id FROM crdb_internal.ranges WHERE table_name = 'x'`, use: `SELECT range_id FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE x]`
      - Instead of `SELECT range_id FROM crdb_internal.ranges WHERE table_name = $1 OR table_id = $2` (variable / unpredictable table name or ID), use: `SELECT range_id FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM CURRENT_CATALOG WITH TABLES] WHERE table_name = $1 OR table_id = $2`
      - Instead of `SELECT start_key FROM crdb_internal.ranges WHERE table_name = 'x'`, use: `SELECT raw_start_key FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE x WITH KEYS]`
      - Instead of `SELECT start_key FROM crdb_internal.ranges WHERE table_name = $1 OR table_id = $2` (unpredictable / variable table name or ID), use: `SELECT raw_start_key FROM [SHOW RANGES FROM CURRENT_CATALOG WITH TABLES, KEYS] WHERE table_name = $1 OR table_id = $2` [#93644][#93644]
- When the [cluster setting `sql.show_ranges_deprecated_behavior.enabled` is set to `false` (recommended in v23.1)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings#setting-sql-show-ranges-deprecated-behavior-enabled), the format of the columns `start_key` and `end_key` for [`SHOW RANGES FROM DATABASE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges) and `SHOW RANGES FROM TABLE` have been extended to include which table/index the key belongs to. This is necessary because a range can now contain data from more than one table/index. [#93644][#93644]
- When the [cluster setting `sql.show_ranges_deprecated_behavior.enabled` is set to `false` (recommended in v23.1)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings#setting-sql-show-ranges-deprecated-behavior-enabled), the output of [`SHOW RANGES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges) no longer includes `range_size`, `range_size_mb`, `lease_holder`, or `lease_holder_localities` by default. This ensures that `SHOW RANGES` remains fast in the common case. Use the new option [`WITH DETAILS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges#options) to include these columns. [#93644][#93644]
- The format of the columns `start_key` and `end_key` for `SHOW RANGE ... FOR ROW` has been changed to be consistent with the output of `SHOW RANGES FROM INDEX`. [#93644][#93644]
- Changefeeds using "preview" expressions (released in v23.1.0) and that access the previous state of the row using the `cdc_prev()` function will no longer work and will need to be recreated with new syntax. [#94429][#94429]
- Some of the transformations specific to changefeeds have been deprecated and replaced. These functions were released in limited access in v22.2.  Deprecated changefeed transformations continue to function. Closely monitor changefeeds that are created during upgrade. While effort was made to maintain backward compatibility, the updated changefeed transformation may produce slightly different output, such as different column names. [#96295][#96295]
- Fixed a bug where, when `server.identity_map.configuration` was used, CockroachDB did not verify the client-provided username against the target mappings. Note that **this means that the client must now provide a valid DB username.** This requirement is compatible with PostgreSQL; it was not previously required by CockroachDB but it is now. This does not apply when identity maps are not in use. [#94915][#94915]
- Previously, the type of the `replicas`, `voting_replicas`,`non_voting_replicas` and `learner_replicas` in `crdb_internal.ranges` were overridden to `INT2VECTOR` causing incompatible indexing between `.ranges` and `.ranges_no_leases`. Now the types of those columns in the two tables are set to `INT[]`. [#96287][#96287]
- The output of the [`SHOW RANGES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/show-ranges) command for the `crdb_internal.ranges` and `crdb_internal.ranges_no_leases` tables has been updated, and the previous output is deprecated. To enable the new command output, set the `sql.show_ranges_deprecated_behavior.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) to `false`. The new output will become default in v23.2. [#99618][#99618]
- Previously, if a user specified a [`search_path`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/sql-name-resolution#current-schema) in the connection string parameters, it would always be treated as case sensitive. Now, in order to have the schema names in the `search_path` respect case, the user must include double quotes around the name. [#101492][#101492]
- The deprecated CLI command `debug unsafe-remove-dead-replicas` has been removed. Use `debug recover` instead. [#89150][#89150]

<h4 id="v23-1-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.

| Category | Description | Change Type | Backport version |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQL language change | The [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `sql.ttl.default_range_concurrency` and table storage parameter `ttl_range_concurrency` are no longer configurable. [#89392](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/89392) | No longer configurable | v22.2.1 |
| SQL language change | The `sql.distsql.max_running_flows` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) has been removed. [#84888](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/84888) | Removed | None |
| Operational change | The [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `server.web_session.purge.period` and `server.web_session.purge.max_deletions_per_cycle`, which were specific to the cleanup function for `system.web_sessions`, have been replaced by `server.log_gc.period` and `server.log_gc.max_deletions_per_cycle` which apply to the cleanup function for `system.eventlog`, `system.rangelog` and `system.web_sessions` equally. [#90789](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/90789) | Removed, repurposed | None |
| Operational change | The [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `server.web_session.auto_logout.timeout` has been removed. [#90789](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/90789) | Removed, defaults to true | None |
| Operational change | The [load-based splitter](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/load-based-splitting) now supports using request CPU usage to split ranges. This is introduced with the previous cluster setting `kv.allocator.load_based_rebalancing.objective`, which when set to `cpu`, will use request CPU usage. The threshold above which CPU usage of a range is considered for splitting is defined in the cluster setting `kv.range_split.load_cpu_threshold`, which has a default value of `250ms`. (Relates to #100211 in this table.) [#96128](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/96128) | Repurposed | None |
| Operational change | The `kv.range_split.load_cpu_threshold` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings#setting-kv-range-split-load-cpu-threshold) now has a minimum setting value of `10ms`. Previously there was no minimum so, while unlikely, this could have an impact if you had chosen a custom setting lower than the established minimum. [#98250](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/98250) | New minimum | None |
| Security update | The new [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `server.user_login.downgrade_scram_stored_passwords_to_bcrypt.enabled`, which allows you to migrate passwords from SCRAM to bcrypt during user authentication, defaults to `true`. If it is `true` and if `server.user_login.password_encryption` is `crdb-bcrypt`, then during login, the stored hashed password will be migrated from SCRAM to bcrypt. [#97429](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/97429) | New setting | v22.2.6 |
| Security update | The default value for the `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) is now 10610. (Previously the default was 119680.) The old value was found to have been too high for many types of client hardware, and in some cases could cause regressions in connection latency. The new value was chosen by running tests with clients that have 1 or 2 vCPUs provisioned. Additionally, the new cluster setting `server.user_login.rehash_scram_stored_passwords_on_cost_change.enabled` was added, and defaults to `true`. If it is `true` and the stored SCRAM password for a user has a different cost than the configured default cost, then the next time the user logs in, their password will automatically be rehashed using the configured default cost. If the rehashing is not desired, then operators should update the `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256` cluster setting to the value they desire before upgrading. This change is being backported to [v22.2](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.2). [#98254](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/98254) | Changed default | v22.2.7 |
| Command-line change | The `--drain-wait` argument to the [`cockroach node drain`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cockroach-node) command will be automatically increased if the command detects that it is smaller than the sum of the [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/node-shutdown#cluster-settings) `server.shutdown.drain_wait`, `server.shutdown.connection_wait`, `server.shutdown.query_wait` times two, and `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`. If the `--drain-wait` argument is 0, then no timeout is used. This recommendation [was already documented](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/node-shutdown#drain-timeout), but now the advice will be applied automatically. [#98390](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/98390) | New effect | v22.2.1 |
| Bug fix | RPC connections between nodes now require RPC connections to be established in both directions, otherwise the connection will be closed. This is done to prevent asymmetric network partitions where nodes are able to send outbound messages but not receive inbound messages, which could result in persistent unavailability. This behavior can be disabled by the [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `rpc.dialback.enabled`. [#94778](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/94778) | New setting, enabled by default | None |
| Bug fix | Fixed a rare bug introduced in v22.2.0 that could cause a node to crash with an `attempting to append refresh spans after the tracked timestamp has moved forward` error when querying virtual tables in the [`crdb_internal`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/crdb-internal) or [`pg_catalog`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/pg-catalog) system catalogs. If you are experiencing this bug, set the `sql.distsql.use_streamer.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) to `false` before upgrading a cluster to v23.1. [#99443](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/99443) | New guidance | v22.2.8 |
| Bug fix | The [**Hot Ranges** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-hot-ranges-page) DB Console page would show hot ranges by CPU and not QPS (queries per second), depending on the value of the `kv.allocator.load_based_rebalancing.objective` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) (default `cpu`). Now the page will always collect statistics based on QPS. (Relates to #96128 in this table.) [#100211](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/100211) | Repurposed setting | No |

<h4 id="v23-1-0-deprecations">Deprecations</h4>

- Ordinal column references (e.g., `SELECT @1, @2 FROM t`) are now deprecated. By default, statements using this syntax will now result in an error. If desired, such statements can be allowed using the session setting `SET allow_ordinal_column_references=true`. Support for ordinal column references is scheduled to be removed in upcoming version v23.2. [#93754][#93754]
- The `CONTROLCHANGEFEED` [role option](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/alter-role#role-options) will be deprecated in the future (see issue [#94757](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/94757)). With this change, usages of the `CONTROLCHANGEFEED` role option will come with a deprecation warning. Its existing behavior remains the same. The `SELECT` and `CHANGEFEED` privileges will be used for changefeeds henceforth:
   - The `SELECT` privilege on a set of tables allows a user to run core changefeeds against them.
   - The `CHANGEFEED` privilege on a set of tables allows a user to run enterprise changefeeds on them, and also manage the underlying changefeed job (ie. view, pause, cancel, and resume the job).
   Notably, a new [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) `changefeed.permissions.require_external_connection_sink.enabled` is added and set to `false` by default. Enabling this setting restricts users with `CHANGEFEED` on a set of tables to create enterprise changefeeds into external connections only. To use a given external connection, a user typically needs the `USAGE` privilege on it.  Note that `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` can be used with both the `CHANGEFEED` and `SELECT` privileges to assign coarse-grained permissions (i.e., assign permissions to all tables in a schema rather than manually assign them for each table). [#94796][#94796]
- Deprecated the `PGDUMP` and `MYSQLDUMP` formats for [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/import). They are still present, but will be removed in a future release. See the [Migration Overview](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/migration-overview) page for alternatives. [#96386][#96386]
