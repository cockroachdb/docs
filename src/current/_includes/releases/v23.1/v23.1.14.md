## v23.1.14

Release Date: January 17, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-1-14-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now supports [importing into](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/import-into) a table that has columns typed as arrays of user-defined types (such as enums). Tables that use multiple user-defined types with the same name but different schemas are still unsupported. [#116361][#116361]
- Added a new field, `StmtPosInTxn`, to the `CommonSQLExecDetails` (included in SQL audit logs, SQL execution logs, and telemetry events) to represent the statement's index (position) in the transaction. The first statement's `StmtPosInTxn` is `1`. [#116558][#116558]

<h3 id="v23-1-14-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Updated the [`changefeed.lagging_ranges_threshold`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings#settings) and [`changefeed.lagging_ranges_polling_interval`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings#settings) cluster settings to be public in v23.1. [#115803][#115803]

<h3 id="v23-1-14-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**Cluster Overview** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-cluster-overview-page) now correctly renders the background color for email signups, fixing an issue where it was difficult to read the text. [#114546][#114546]
- Updated the **CPU Time** label to **SQL CPU Time** on the [Overview page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview-dashboard) and clarified the tooltip. [#116448][#116448]
- Fixed an issue where the following `AggHistogram`-powered metrics reported quantiles incorrectly in the [Overview page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/ui-overview-dashboard). The list of affected metrics is:
    - `changefeed.message_size_hist`
    - `changefeed.parallel_io_queue_nanos`
    - `changefeed.sink_batch_hist_nanos`
    - `changefeed.flush_hist_nanos`
    - `changefeed.commit_latency`
    - `changefeed.admit_latency`
    - `jobs.row_level_ttl.span_total_duration`
    - `jobs.row_level_ttl.select_duration`
    - `jobs.row_level_ttl.delete_duration`

    This bug affected only DB Console dashboards and not the Prometheus-compatible endpoint `/_status/vars`. [#114747][#114747]
- In the **SQL Activity Transaction Details** page, you can now view a transaction fingerprint ID across multiple applications by passing a comma-separated encoded string of transaction fingerprint IDs in the `appNames` URL search parameter. [#116102][#116102]

<h3 id="v23-1-14-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in in the TimeScale component's **Now** button behavior that could prevent charts from updating after a custom time range was selected.[#115513][#115513]
- Fixed a bug where an active replication report update could get stuck in a retry loop on clusters with over 10000 ranges, which would prevent a node from shutting down cleanly. [#114242][#114242]
- Fixed a nil pointer dereference bug in the error handling for `GetFiles`. [#114829][#114829]
- Fixed a bug that prevented the **SQL Activity** page from showing internal statements when the `sql.stats.response.show_internal.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings) was set to `true`. [#114819][#114819]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a discrepancy between computed statistics and the stored value for statics when a delete was rolled back. [#113772][#113772]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that could cause an internal error Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an internal error when using a prepared statement using the `text` format with a user-defined composite type. [#115063][#115063]
- Fixed a bug that would cause a [prepared statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/sql-grammar#prepare_stmt) to fail if it references an enum as well as a table that has undergone a schema change. [#115174][#115174]
- Fixed a bug that could cause finalization during a major-version upgrade to contend with descriptor lease renewals on a large cluster. Descriptor lease renewals now always have a lower priority than finalization. [#114672][#114672]
- [Backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/backup) now evenly distribute their work across all replicas, including followers, regardless of leaseholder placement. [#115018][#115018]
- Fixed a bug that could cause replica processing in store queues to get stuck if a the replica's ID has changed. [#115036][#115036]
- Fixed an bug introduced in v22.2 that could lead to stuck queries or inaccurate results when using lookup [joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/joins) involving equality columns and multiple ranges. [#115581][#115581]
- Fixed a bug in the declarative schema changer that could cause [`CREATE INDEX`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/create-index) with expressions to fail on materialized [views](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/views). [#115596][#115596]
- Fixed a bug that could cause an inaccorate "too few columns" error for a query that used `ANY {array}` syntax with a subquery. [#115591][#115591]
- Fixed a bug that could cause  a "too few/many columns" errors for a query that used an `IN` or `NOT IN` clause with a non-trivial right operand, such as a subquery (rather than a constant tuple). [#115591][#115591]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.2 that could cause errors or inaccurate results when performing a lookup or index [join](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/joins) on a table with three or more column families. [#115899][#115899]
- Fixed a bug that could cause an internal error or a panic while attempting to forecast statistics on a numeric column. [#115899][#115899]
- Fixed a bug when issuing a [`BEGIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/begin-transaction) statement where incorrect `Age` field could be logged in the statement log. This bug could also cause statements to incorrectly appear in the slow query log. [#115257][#115257]
- Fixed a bug in the SQL Statistics UI where the runtime was incorrectly calculated. This bug could cause recorded values to appear to exceed 100%. [#117497][#117497]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a `CREATE CHANGEFEED WITH {key_column}` statement to retry forever. [#117555][#117555]

<h3 id="v23-1-14-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Reduced query planning time significantly for some queries that join multiple tables. [#114512][#114512][#116107][#116107]
