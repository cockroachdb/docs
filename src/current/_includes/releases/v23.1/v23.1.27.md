<h3 id="v23-1-27-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare bug where a [lease transfer](/docs/v23.1/architecture/replication-layer.md#epoch-based-leases-table-data) could lead to a `side-transport update saw closed timestamp regression` panic. The bug could occur when a node was [overloaded](/docs/v23.1/ui-overload-dashboard.md) and failing to heartbeat its [node liveness](/docs/v23.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.md#node-liveness-issues) record.
