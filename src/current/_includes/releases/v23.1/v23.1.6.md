<h3 id="v23-1-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in v23.1.5 where [debug zips]({% link v23.1/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}) were empty in the `crdb_internal.cluster_settings.txt` file. Debug zips now properly show the information from `cluster_settings`. [#107105][#107105]
- Fixed a bug where some primary indexes would incorrectly be treated internally as secondary indexes, which could cause schema change operations to fail. The bug could occur if [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`]({% link v23.1/alter-table.md %}#alter-primary-key) was used on v21.1 or earlier, and the cluster was upgraded. [#106426][#106426]
- Extended the `cockroach debug doctor` to detect [indexes]({% link v23.1/indexes.md %}) which could potentially lose data by being dropped when a column is stored inside them and added a check inside [`DROP INDEX`]({% link v23.1/drop-index.md %}) to prevent dropping indexes with this problem to avoid data loss. [#106863][#106863]
