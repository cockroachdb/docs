- [Azure Blob Storage credentials for implicit authentication](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/cloud-storage-authentication?filters=azure#azure-blob-storage-implicit-authentication) can now be stored in a file with the following YAML format:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ yaml
    azure_tenant_id: {MY_TENANT_ID},
    azure_client_id: {MY_CLIENT_ID},
    azure_client_secret: {MY_CLIENT_SECRET}
    ~~~

    Set the environment variable `COCKROACH_AZURE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to the path of the file. The implicit authentication method first attempts to authenticate using credentials in the file before attempting to authenticate using any other credentials specified in the [`DefaultAzureCredential` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet), such as environment variables and Managed Identity. These credentials can also be used for [encrypted backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/take-and-restore-encrypted-backups#use-key-management-service). [#106688][#106688]

<h3 id="v23-1-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [`DROP INDEX ... CASCADE`](../v23.1/drop-index.html) could drop unrelated [foreign key constraints](../v23.1/foreign-key.html). For example, if `DROP INDEX ... CASCADE` was executed on a unique index for a `Table A`, and if a `Table B` had a foreign key reference to `Table A`, unrelated outbound foreign key constraints on `Table B` would be dropped. [#107793][#107793]
- Fixed a bug that would result in corruption of [encrypted data at rest on a cluster node](../v23.1/security-reference/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest). If a node with this corrupted state was restarted, the node could fail to rejoin the cluster. If multiple nodes encountered this bug at the same time during roll out, the cluster could lose [quorum](../v23.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#overview). For more information, refer to [Technical Advisory 106617](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/advisories/a106617). [#107277][#107277]
