<h3 id="v23-1-25-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Secrets are now sanitized from URLs before being written to unredacted [logs](/docs/v23.1/configure-logs.md) when used in the following SQL statements:
    - [`BACKUP`](/docs/v23.1/backup.md)
    - [`RESTORE`](/docs/v23.1/restore.md)
    - [`CREATE SCHEDULE FOR BACKUP`](/docs/v23.1/create-schedule-for-backup.md)
    - [`ALTER BACKUP SCHEDULE`](/docs/v23.1/alter-backup-schedule.md)
    - [`ALTER BACKUP`](/docs/v23.1/alter-backup.md)
    - [`SHOW BACKUP`](/docs/v23.1/show-backup.md)
    - [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](/docs/v23.1/create-changefeed.md)
    - [`CREATE SCHEDULE FOR CHANGEFEED`](/docs/v23.1/create-schedule-for-changefeed.md)
    - [`ALTER CHANGEFEED SET {sink}`](/docs/v23.1/alter-changefeed.md)
    - [`IMPORT`](/docs/v23.1/import.md)
    - [`EXPORT`](/docs/v23.1/export.md)
    - [`CREATE EXTERNAL CONNECTION`](/docs/v23.1/create-external-connection.md)
    - [`COPY`](/docs/v23.1/copy-from.md)

    [#127537][#127537]
- The cluster setting [`server.jwt_authentication.issuers`](/docs/v23.1/sso-sql.md#cluster-settings) can now take multiple values to support various kinds of providers and their mapped JWKS URIs. This can be set to one of the following values:
    - Simple string that Go can parse as a valid issuer URL: `'https://accounts.google.com'`.
    - String that can be parsed as a valid JSON array of issuer URLs list: `['example.com/adfs','https://accounts.google.com']`.
    - String that can be parsed as a valid JSON and deserialized into a map of issuer URLs to corresponding JWKS URIs. In the third case, CockroachDB will override the JWKS URI present in the issuer's well-known endpoint: `'{ "issuer_jwks_map": { "https://accounts.google.com": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs", "example.com/adfs": "https://example.com/adfs/discovery/keys" } }'`.

    When `issuer_jwks_map` is set, CockroachDB directly uses the JWKS URI to get the key set. In all other cases where [`server.jwt_authentication.jwks_auto_fetch.enabled`](/docs/v23.1/sso-sql.md#cluster-settings) is set CockroachDB obtains the JWKS URI first from the issuer's well-known endpoint and then uses this endpoint. [#128751][#128751]

<h3 id="v23-1-25-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `sql.auth.grant_option_inheritance.enabled` [cluster setting](/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-sql-auth-grant-option-inheritance-enabled). The default value is `true`, which results in behavior that matches the existing behavior of CockroachDB. When set to `false`, the [`GRANT OPTION`](/docs/v23.1/grant.md) is not inherited via role membership, which will prevent the descendant roles from being able to grant the privilege to others. The privilege itself is still inherited via role membership. [#126862][#126862]
- Added the `sql.auth.grant_option_for_owner.enabled` [cluster setting](/docs/v23.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-sql-auth-grant-option-for-owner-enabled). The default value is `true`, which results in behavior that matches the existing behavior of CockroachDB. When set to `false`, then the [`GRANT OPTION`](/docs/v23.1/grant.md) is not implcitly given to the owner of an object. The object owner still implicitly has all privileges on the object, just not the ability to grant them to other users. [#127005][#127005]

<h3 id="v23-1-25-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [Database](/docs/v23.1/ui-databases-page.md) details and Table details pages in the [DB Console](/docs/v23.1/ui-overview.md) now display the correct `"stats last created"` value. [#126415][#126415]
- The [Database](/docs/v23.1/ui-databases-page.md) and Tables pages in the [DB Console](/docs/v23.1/ui-overview.md) will show a loading state while loading information for databases and tables including size and [range](/docs/v23.1/architecture/glossary.md#architecture-range) counts. [#127699][#127699]
- In the [Database](/docs/v23.1/ui-databases-page.md) details page, the table name will no longer appear with quotes around the schema and table name. [#127763][#127763]
- [`ALTER ROLE`](/docs/v23.1/alter-role.md) events in the [DB Console](/docs/v23.1/ui-overview.md) event log now render correctly when the event does not contain any role options. [#126563][#126563]
- Fixed a bug where the [Databases](/docs/v24.1/ui-databases-page.md) page crashed if the range information was not available. [#127090][#127090]

<h3 id="v23-1-25-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in which the [`DISCARD`](/docs/v23.1/alter-table.md) statement was disallowed with [`default_transaction_read_only = on`](/docs/v23.1/session-variables.md). [#127549][#127549]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION`](/docs/v23.1/alter-database.md#drop-region) could fail if any tables under the given database have [indexes on expressions](/docs/v23.1/expression-indexes.md). [#126600][#126600]
- Fixed a bug when [restoring](/docs/v23.1/restore.md) a database with a [composite type](/docs/v23.1/create-type.md#create-a-composite-data-type). [#126847][#126847]
- Fixed a bug when inputting [`public` role](/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization.md#default-roles) as user name for [built-in compatibility functions](/docs/v23.1/functions-and-operators.md#compatibility-functions), such as `has_database_privilege` and `has_schema_privilege`. [#126853][#126853]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate an [`IS NOT NULL`](/docs/v23.1/null-handling.md#nulls-and-simple-comparisons) filter if it was applied to non-`NULL` tuples that had `NULL` elements, such as `(1, NULL)` or `(NULL, NULL)`. This bug has existed since v20.2. [#126942][#126942]
- Fixed a bug where [`CREATE TABLE`](/docs/v23.1/create-table.md) with [index expressions](/docs/v23.1/expression-indexes.md) could hit undefined column errors on [transaction retries](/docs/v23.1/transaction-retry-error-reference.md). [#126200][#126200]
- Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak when executing SQL statements with comments, for example, `SELECT /* comment */ 1;`. Memory owned by a SQL session would continue to grow as these types of statements were executed. The memory would only be released when closing the [SQL session](/docs/v24.2/show-sessions.md). This bug has been present since v23.1. [#127757][#127757]
- Fixed a bug where [`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`](/docs/v23.1/create-index.md) would not correctly short-circuit if the given index already existed. [#128239][#128239]
- Fixed a bug in syntax validation, in which the `DESCENDING` clause was not allowed for non-terminal columns of an [inverted index](/docs/v23.1/inverted-indexes.md). Only the last column of an inverted index should be prevented from being `DESCENDING`. This is now properly checked. [#128239][#128239]
- Fixed a bug where an [index](/docs/v23.1/indexes.md) could store a column in the primary index if that column had a mixed-case name. [#128239][#128239]
- Fixed a memory leak that could occur when specifying a non-existent virtual cluster name in the connection string. [#128110][#128110]
- Setting or dropping a default value on a [computed column](/docs/v23.1/computed-columns.md) is now blocked, even for `NULL` defaults. Previously, setting or dropping a default value on a computed column was a no-op. [#128468][#128468]
