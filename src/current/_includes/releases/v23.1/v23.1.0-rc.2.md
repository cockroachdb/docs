<h3 id="v23-1-0-rc-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in versions 22.1.19, 22.2.8, and pre-release versions of 23.1 that could cause queries to return spurious insufficient [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization) errors. For the bug to occur, two databases would need to have duplicate tables, each with a [foreign key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/foreign-key) reference to another table. The error would then occur if the same SQL string was executed against both databases concurrently by users that have [privileges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization) over only one of the tables.
