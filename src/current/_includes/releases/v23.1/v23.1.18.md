## v23.1.18

Release Date: April 9, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-1-18-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed an oversight where CockroachDB was allowing mutation statements (such as [`UPDATE`]({% link v23.1/update.md %}) or [`DELETE`]({% link v23.1/delete.md %})) and locking statements (such as [`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`]({% link v23.1/select-for-update.md %})) in implicit single-statement [transactions]({% link v23.1/transactions.md %}) using [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`]({% link v23.1/as-of-system-time.md %}). [#120159][#120159]

<h3 id="v23-1-18-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `admission.kv.bulk_only.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v23.1/cluster-settings.md %}), when set to `true`, only skips store-level [admission control]({% link v23.1/admission-control.md %}) for normal priority work, and continues to subject the work to CPU admission control. [#119173][#119173]

<h3 id="v23-1-18-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Resolved an issue where clusters with multiple [stores]({% link v23.1/cockroach-start.md %}#store) per node could list inaccurate region/node information on the [Databases Page]({% link v23.1/ui-databases-page.md %}). [#120234][#120234]
- Fixed a bug where the [timeseries graphs shown on the **SQL Activity Statement Fingerprint** page]({% link v23.1/ui-statements-page.md %}#charts) in [DB Console]({% link v23.1/ui-overview.md %}) were not rendering properly. This involved fixing a bug related to setting the time range of the charts. [#121783][#121783]

<h3 id="v23-1-18-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, on long-running [sessions]({% link v23.1/show-sessions.md %}) that issue many (hundreds of thousands or more) [transactions]({% link v23.1/transactions.md %}), CockroachDB's internal memory accounting system, the limit for which is configured via the [`--max-sql-memory` flag]({% link v23.1/cockroach-start.md %}#general)), could leak. This bug, in turn, could result in the error message `"root: memory budget exceeded"` for other queries. The bug was present in v23.1.17 and is now fixed. [#121874][#121874]
- Fix a bug where running [`RESTORE`]({% link v23.1/restore.md %}) on certain [backups]({% link v23.1/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}) would open a very large number of connections to the [backup storage provider]({% link v23.1/use-cloud-storage.md %}). [#119925][#119925]
- A user with the `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization#managing-privileges) can no longer see constants inside of queries that originate from other [users](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization#roles) in the [`SHOW SESSIONS`]({% link v23.1/show-sessions.md %}) result. Previously, this redaction did not occur. [#119963][#119963]
- Previously, the [`SHOW QUERIES`]({% link v23.1/show-statements.md %}#aliases) and [`SHOW STATEMENTS`]({% link v23.1/show-statements.md %}) required the user to have the `VIEWACTIVITY` or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/security-reference/authorization#managing-privileges). However, a user should always be able to view their own queries, even without these privileges. This is now fixed. [#119963][#119963]
- Fixed a bug in which it was possible to `SET transaction_read_only = false` during an [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`]({% link v23.1/as-of-system-time.md %}) transaction. [#120159][#120159]
- Fixed a slow memory leak that could accumulate when opening many new [connections]({% link v23.1/connection-pooling.md %}). The bug was present in v22.2.9+ and v23.1+. [#120242][#120242]
- Users will no longer see [views]({% link v23.1/views.md %}) displayed on the [**Databases** page]({% link v23.1/ui-databases-page.md %}) in [DB Console]({% link v23.1/ui-overview.md %}). Previously, views would be listed with no information, only displaying errors. [#120213][#120213]

<h3 id="v23-1-18-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Enabled the [admission control]({% link v23.1/admission-control.md %}) CPU limiter for [row-level TTL]({% link v23.1/row-level-ttl.md %}) to reduce latency impact from CPU-intensive scans issued as part of [row-level TTL jobs]({% link v23.1/row-level-ttl.md %}#view-scheduled-ttl-jobs). [#120516][#120516]
