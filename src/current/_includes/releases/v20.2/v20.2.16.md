- Fixed a bug causing [changefeeds](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) to sometimes get stuck. [#68009][#68009]
- Fixed an error in which cascaded [drops of views](../v20.2/drop-view.html) could incorrectly run into `table ... is being dropped` errors. [#68617][#68617]
- Fixed an oversight in the data generator for TPC-H which was causing a smaller number of distinct values to be generated for `p_type` and `p_container` in the part table than the spec calls for. [#68709][#68709]
- Fixed a bug in [full cluster restores](../v20.2/restore.html#full-cluster) where dropped descriptor revisions would cause the restore to fail. [#69639][#69639]
- Fixed a bug that created non-partial unique constraints when a user attempted to create a partial unique constraint in [`ALTER TABLE`](../v20.2/alter-table.html) statements. [#68747][#68747]
- Fixed a bug where the `schedules.backup.succeeded` and `schedules.backup.failed` metrics would sometimes not be updated. [#69257][#69257]
- Fixed a bug that could cause prolonged unavailability due to lease transfer to a replica that may be in need of a Raft snapshot. [#69801][#69801]
