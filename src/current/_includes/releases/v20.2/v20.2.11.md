<h3 id="v20-2-11-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Floating point infinity values are now formatted as `Infinity` (or `-Infinity` if negative). This is for compatibility with PostgreSQL [#65105][#65105] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE SET`](../v20.2/insert.html#on-conflict-clause) statements without predicates now acquire locks using the `FOR UPDATE` locking mode during their initial row scan, which improves performance for contended workloads. This behavior is configurable using the [`enable_implicit_select_for_update` session variable](../v20.2/set-vars.html) and the [`sql.defaults.implicit_select_for_update.enabled` cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) [#65364][#65364] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [`ST_GeomFromGeoJSON(string)`](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) spatial function is now marked as the preferred overload, meaning it will resolve correctly in more contexts. [#65441][#65441] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The cancellation behavior for [DistSQL](../v20.2/architecture/sql-layer.html) flows has been improved. [#65046][#65046]

<h3 id="v20-2-11-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where empty series would show up in metrics graphs and legends, and when data was incorrectly attributed to the wrong nodes on graphs for clusters with decommissioned nodes. [#66034][#66034]
- Removed shading on line graphs, which improves legibility when viewing more than a few series on the same plot. [#66034][#66034]
- Drag to zoom on metrics graphs now supports time ranges under 10 minutes. [#66034][#66034] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-2-11-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) no longer resolves intents one by one. This eliminates the need to run a high-priority query to clean up intents to unblock `BACKUP` in case of intent buildup. [#64931][#64931]
- Fixed a bug that could cause backups to be slower. `LockTableWaiter` now checks the finalized transaction cache before pushing transactions to avoid duplicating work. [#64999][#64999]
- Fixed a bug where interval math on a [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v20.2/timestamp.html) on a DST boundary would incorrectly add or subtract an extra hour. [#65097][#65097]
- Fixed a bug where `date_trunc` on a [`TIME`](../v20.2/time.html) value on a DST boundary could switch timezones and produce the incorrect result. [#65097][#65097]
- Fixed a bug causing the [`ZONECONFIG` privilege](../v20.2/authorization.html#privileges) on tables and databases to be incorrectly interpreted as `USAGE`, which could corrupt a table and/or database because `USAGE` is an invalid privilege for tables and databases. Also fixed the case when the `ZONECONFIG` privilege would be incorrectly restored as `USAGE` for tables and databases created and backed up in v20.1 and then restored through a full cluster `RESTORE` in v20.2 or later. [#65159][#65159]
- Fixed a bug which could cause a panic when running an `EXECUTE` of a previously prepared statement with a `REGCLASS` or `REGTYPE` parameter or a [user-defined type](../v20.2/enum.html) argument after running [`BEGIN AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v20.2/as-of-system-time.html) with an invalid timestamp. [#65150][#65151]
- Fixed a bug which could cause a panic when issuing a query referencing a [user-defined type](../v20.2/enum.html) as a placeholder. [#65151][#65151]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.2 that caused rows to be incorrectly de-duplicated from a scan with a non-unique index. [#65288][#65288]
- Fixed a bug causing `revision_history` cluster [backups](../v20.2/backup.html) to not include dropped databases. This means that, previously, dropped databases could not be restored from backups that were taken after the database was dropped. [#65317][#65317]
- Fixed a bug where empty [zone configurations](../v20.2/configure-zone.html) get created for certain indexes during [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v20.2/alter-primary-key.html). [#65175][#65175]
- Fixed a bug causing [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](../v20.2/show-create.html) output to not display the [zone configurations](../v20.2/configure-zone.html) of a table or index if there were no partitions, even if there were zone configurations on the index or table. [#65175][#65175]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER DATABASE ... SET OWNER ...`](../v20.2/alter-database.html) did not work if the database name was a keyword. [#65367][#65367]
- Fixed a bug where [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](../v20.2/show-create.html) would show the [zone configurations](../v20.2/configure-zone.html) of a table with the same name from a different schema. [#65369][#65369]
- Previously, CockroachDB would crash when attempting to create a table using [`CREATE TABLE ... AS`](../v20.2/create-table-as.html) syntax where `AS` selects from `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics`, `crdb_internal.node_transaction_statistics`, or `crdb_internal.node_txn_stats` virtual tables. [#65544][#65544]
- Fixed a bug where binary [`TIMETZ`](../v20.2/time.html) values were not being decoded correctly when sent as a parameter in the wire protocol. [#65579][#65579]
- A certain percentage of cases in which a node could have served a follower read were not handled correctly, resulting in the node routing the request to another nearby node for no reason. This has been fixed. [#65470][#65470]
- Fixed a race condition during transaction cleanup that could leave old transaction records behind until MVCC garbage collection. [#65384][#65384]
- Improved transaction cleanup for disconnected clients to reduce intent buildup. [#65384][#65384]
- Fixed a bug where the [storage layer](../v20.2/architecture/storage-layer.html) would under some rare write-heavy workloads start off by writing `SSTable` files that were too small for CockroachDB to manage effectively. The storage layer now creates fewer, larger files under those workloads, in line with expected behavior. [#65481][#65481]
- [Scheduled backups](../v20.2/manage-a-backup-schedule.html) with [interleaved tables](../v20.2/interleave-in-parent.html) can now be created with the `include_deprecated_interleaves` option. [#65730][#65730]
- Calling [`get_bit` or `set_bit`](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#string-and-byte-functions) on a byte array argument now goes to the correct index of the underlying bitstring, which matches the Postgres behavior. [#65787][#65787]
- Previously, [`ALTER DATABASE ... CONVERT TO SCHEMA`](../v20.2/alter-database.html) could potentially leave the schema with invalid privileges thus causing the privilege descriptor to be invalid. [#65813][#65813]
- Fixed a scenario in which a rapid sequence of splits could trigger a storm of Raft snapshots. This would be accompanied by log messages of the form `would have dropped incoming MsgApp, but allowing due to ...`, which tended to occur as part of [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html)/[`IMPORT`](../v20.2/import.html) operations. [#65500][#65500]
- Previously, a schema's privilege descriptor could become corrupted upon executing [`ALTER DATABASE ... CONVERT TO SCHEMA`](../v20.2/alter-database.html). This is due to privileges that are invalid on a schema being copied over to the schema, rendering the schema unusable due to invalid privileges. [#65999][#65999]
- Previously, [`TRUNCATE`](../v20.2/truncate.html) transactionally scanned the meta range to find ranges to unsplit, creating contention with `TRUNCATE`'s new behavior of preserving splits. [#65942][#65942]
- Fixed the error classification for duplicate index names where the later index was a [`UNIQUE`](../v20.2/unique.html) index. [#64002][#64002]
- Fixed the error classification for [`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE`](../v20.2/alter-table.html) with the same name as an existing index. [#64002][#64002]
- Fixed a bug in [`SHOW RANGES`](../v20.2/show-ranges.html) that misattributed localities to nodes when using multiple stores. [#66038][#66038]
- Fixed a bug where [incremental backups](../v20.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) with [`revision_history`](../v20.2/backup.html#options) would sometimes fail if a view was altered between incremental backups. [#66072][#66072]

<h3 id="v20-2-11-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Fixed an issue in the optimizer that prevented spatial predicates of the form `(column && value) = true` from being index-accelerated. These queries can now use a [spatial index](../v20.2/spatial-indexes.html), if one is available. [#65988][#65988]
