<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `INTERVAL(6)` is now supported as an alias for [`INTERVAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/interval), for compatibility with third-party tools. [#41447][#41447]
- Added the `pg_available_extensions` table, for compatibility with third-party tools. [#41447][#41447]
- The `pg_attrdef()` and `pg_get_indexdef()` [built-in functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators) no longer include type annotations on default expressions, and `pg_get_indexdef()` now includes the index method in the returned `CREATE INDEX` statement, for compatibility with third-party tools. [#41447][#41447]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The `generate_subscripts()` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators) now behaves properly on `int2vector` and `oidvector` types. [#41447][#41447]
- Fixed a bug causing the `cluster_logical_timestamp()` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators) to sometimes return incorrect results. [#41439][#41439]
- Prevented an unlikely race condition where a WAL pending recycling could be deleted, leading to a crash. This bug was present in past 19.2 alphas/betas only, not in any earlier release. [#41523][#41523]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Metadata queries that use the `'string'::regclass` form are now much more efficient in the presence of a large number of tables. [#41447][#41447]
- The `pg_get_coldesc()` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators) now retrieves comments more efficiently. [#41447][#41447]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-1-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- Clarified epoch-based vs. expiration-based leases in the [Replication Layer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/architecture/replication-layer#epoch-based-leases-table-data) architecture documentation. [#5578][#5578]
- Updated the list of [Enterprise features](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/enterprise-licensing). [#5599][#5599]
- Documented the new [`--geo-partitioned-replicas` flag of the `cockroach demo` command](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/cockroach-demo#start-a-multi-region-demo-cluster-with-automatic-geo-partitioning), which starts a 9-node in-memory cluster with the [Geo-Partitioned Replicas](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/topology-geo-partitioned-replicas) data topology applied to the `movr` database. This lets you quickly simulate one of the most effective data topology patterns for getting low latency in a multi-region cluster. [#5587][#5587]
