<h3 id="v19-2-4-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Previous versions of CockroachDB were incorrectly enabling non-admin SQL users to use the [statements details](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/admin-ui-statements-page) in the Admin UI and the HTTP endpoint `/_status/statements`. This information is sensitive because the endpoint does not hide data that the requester does not have privilege over. This has been corrected by requiring a [SQL `admin` user](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/authorization) to access the statements details page and the HTTP endpoint. [#44354][#44354]

<h3 id="v19-2-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would return an internal error when the [`substring` function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators#string-and-byte-functions) with a negative length was executed via the vectorized engine. CockroachDB now returns a regular query error on executing the function. [#44629][#44629]
- Fixed "no output column equivalent to.." and "column not in input" errors in some cases involving [`DISTINCT ON`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/select-clause#eliminate-duplicate-rows) and [`ORDER BY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/query-order). [#44598][#44598]
- Fixed "expected constant FD to be strict" internal error. [#44604][#44604]
- Fixed possibly incorrect query results in various cornercases, especially when [`SELECT DISTINCT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/select-clause#eliminate-duplicate-rows) is used. [#44604][#44604]
- Fixed a bug where running a query with the [`LIKE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators) operator using the custom `ESCAPE` symbol when the pattern contained Unicode characters could result in an internal error in CockroachDB. [#44648][#44648]
- CockroachDB no longer repeatedly looks for non-existing jobs, which may cause  high memory usage, when cleaning up schema changes. [#44698][#44698]
- Fixed "no indexes" internal error in some cases when we [`GROUP BY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/select-clause#create-aggregate-groups) on a virtual table. [#44723][#44723]
- Fixed invalid query results in some corner cases where part of a [`WHERE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/select-clause#parameters) clause is incorrectly discarded. [#44749][#44749]
- Fixed a typechecking error where [`BETWEEN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/select-clause#filter-aggregate-groups) would sometimes allow boundary expressions of a different type. [#44810][#44810]
- [`CASE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators) operators with an unknown `WHEN` type no longer return an error. [#44818][#44818]
