<h3 id="v19-2-9-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- [Schema changes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/online-schema-changes) are now logged in greater detail. [#50375][#50375]

<h3 id="v19-2-9-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that occurred during [incremental backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/backup#incremental-backups) with revision history on a database (or full cluster) when a table in the database being backed up was dropped. When other tables were later created, dropped, or altered, future incremental backups would return an error. [#50208][#50208]
- Fixed a bug in [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/truncate) that could leave tables in a state where they could not be renamed. [#50714][#50714] [#50756][#50756]#50756]
