<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-2-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Go 1.12.10 is now required to build CockroachDB from source. [#41647][#41647] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Named ports in URLs are no longer supported due to a [URL parsing security fix in Go 1.12.8](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3226f2d492963d361af9dfc6714ef141ba606713). Use port numbers instead. [#41647][#41647] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Mutations under [`UNION` or `UNION ALL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/selection-queries#union-combine-two-queries) are once again supported. [#41500][#41500] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added new `skip` and `nullif` options for [`IMPORT ... DELIMITED DATA`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/import), which ignore the specified number of lines at the beginning of the file and force all empty string fields to be inserted as `NULL` in the imported table, respectively. [#41656][#41656] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is no longer possible to use [`IMPORT INTO`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/import-into) with an [interleaved table](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/interleave-in-parent). This restriction is temporary and will be lifted in a future release. [#41651][#41651] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/import) is no longer allowed during a [rolling upgrade](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/upgrade-cockroach-version). [#41733][#41733] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed multiple bugs relating to `COPY FROM PARENT` in [replication zones](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/configure-replication-zones). [#41677][#41677]
- The `system.replication_stats` table no longer incorrectly shows some ranges belonging to [table partitions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/partitioning) as over-replicated. [#41700][#41700]
- Fixed a bug that resulted in some queries returning an "index join must be against primary index" error. [#41723][#41723]
- Fixed a bug where backfills could lead to certain [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/change-data-capture) row updates never being emitted. [#41721][#41721]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/change-data-capture) row updates to be emitted at a timestamp less than or equal to an already forwarded resolved timestamp. [#41714][#41714]
- Fixed a bug in cloud storage sink file naming for [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/change-data-capture) that could violate ordering in the presence of schema changes. [#41693][#41693]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Increased [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/backup) parallelism in some cases. [#41729][#41729]
- Improved the performance of generating the `system.replication_*` tables for large clusters. [#41757][#41757]
- Improved performance of bulk ingestion. [#41768][#41768]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-rc-2-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- Clarified that to upgrade to the next major version [upgrade path for rolling upgrades](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/upgrade-cockroach-version), a cluster must be on a production release of the previous version, as opposed to a testing release (alpha/beta). [#5644][#5644]
- Documented the experimental [`SHOW RANGE FOR ROW`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/show-range-for-row) statement, which shows information about a range for a particular row of data. This information is useful for verifying how SQL data maps to underlying ranges, and where the replicas for a range are located. [#5612][#5612]
- Improved the usability of the tutorial on [deploying a Python To-Do app with Flask, Kubernetes, and CockroachCloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/deploy-a-python-to-do-app-with-flask-kubernetes-and-cockroachcloud). [#5694][#5694]
- Updated [Helm-specific instructions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes) for Kubernetes version 1.16.0 and fixed various errors. [#5657][#5657], [#5659][#5659]
- Documented the [`FOR UPDATE` locking clause](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/postgresql-compatibility#locking-and-for-update), which is supported in [selection queries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/selection-queries#parameters) for database migration compatibility. [#5658][#5658]
- Documented using `timezone()` and `AT TIME ZONE` functions to convert a `TIMESTAMPTZ` into a [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/timestamp), or vice versa, in a specified timezone. [#5614][#5614]
- Clarified the required privileges for the [`CONFIGURE ZONE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/configure-zone) statement. [#5609][#5609]
