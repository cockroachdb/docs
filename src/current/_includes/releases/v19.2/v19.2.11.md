<h3 id="v19-2-11-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Links to unimplemented issues that are returned in error messages now use the CockroachLabs redirect/short-link server. [#53955][#53955]

<h3 id="v19-2-11-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Reduced memory used by scans of tables containing [JSON](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/jsonb) data. [#53319][#53319]

<h3 id="v19-2-11-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The [Cluster Node Map](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/admin-ui-cluster-overview-page#node-map-enterprise) and the [Debug Page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/admin-ui-debug-pages) that lists cluster localities are now available again to non-admin users. This fixes a bug introduced in v19.2.3. [#53332][#53332]
- Fixed a bug that could cause backfills to fail with a vague `TransactionStatus` error as they are completing. [#53765][#53765]
- Fixed a bug that could cause CockroachDB to crash when evaluating queries with [window functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/window-functions) with the `GROUPS` mode of framing when `OFFSET FOLLOWING` boundary was used and when the offset was a very large value such that it could result in an integer overflow. [#53758][#53758]
- Fixed a bug that could cause CockroachDB to crash when using a `RANGE`-mode window function with an offset in some cases (e.g, `OVER (PARTITION BY b ORDER BY a RANGE 1 PRECEDING`). [#54074][#54074]
- Adding a [`NOT NULL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/not-null) constraint no longer fails with the error `check ... does not exist`. [#54290][#54290]
- A `NOT VALID` [foreign key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/foreign-key) constraint no longer fails with the internal error `table descriptor is not valid: duplicate constraint name`. [#54290][#54290]
- Fixed a bug that could cause columns used in an index containing foreign key columns as a prefix to lead to all of the index columns being set to [`NULL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/null-handling) or [the default value](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/default-value) on `CASCADE`. [#54592][#54592]
- Fixed a rare bug that could lead to index backfills failing on [transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/transactions) restarts. [#54860][#54860]
