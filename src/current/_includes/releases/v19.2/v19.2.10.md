<h3 id="v19-2-10-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed "column not in input" internal error in some corner cases. [#50860][#50860]
- Previously, CockroachDB could crash when internal memory accounting hit a discrepancy. Now it will report an error instead. [#51015][#51015]
- Fixed incorrect results in some cases involving [joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/joins) on interleaved tables with limits. [#51435][#51435]
- Previously, CockroachDB could hit an internal error when executing `regexp_replace` [builtin](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/functions-and-operators#built-in-functions). This has been fixed. [#51348][#51348]
- Previously, CockroachDB could hit a "command is too large" error when performing an [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/upsert) operation with many values. Internally, we attempt to perform such operation by splitting it into "batches", but the batching mechanism was broken. This has been fixed. [#51612][#51612]
- CockroachDB previously could crash on some queries with [merge joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/joins). This has been fixed. [#52074][#52074]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur when an aggregate function argument contained a correlated subquery with another aggregate function referencing the outer scope. This now returns an appropriate user-friendly error, "aggregate function calls cannot be nested". [#52141][#52141]
- Previously, subtracting months from a [`TIMESTAMP` / `TIMESTAMPTZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/timestamp) or [`DATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/date) whose date value is greater than 28 could subtract a further year off. This has been fixed. [#52155][#52155]
- Large write requests no longer have a chance of erroneously throwing a "transaction with sequence has a different value" error. [#52268][#52268]
- Previously, CockroachDB could return incorrect results on query that encountered a `ReadWithinUncertaintyInterval` error. This has been fixed. [#52252][#52252]
- Previously, CockroachDB would erroneously restart the execution of empty, unclosed portals after they had been fully exhausted. This has been fixed. [#52444][#52444]
- Previously, executing a large number of statements in a [transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/transactions) without [committing](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v19.2/commit-transaction) could crash a CockroachDB server. This has been fixed. [#52403][#52403]

<h3 id="v19-2-10-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Queries no longer block during planning if cached table statistics have become stale and the new statistics have not yet been loaded. Instead, the stale statistics are used for planning until the new statistics have been loaded. This improves performance because it prevents latency spikes that may occur if there is a delay in loading the new statistics. [#52189][#52189]
