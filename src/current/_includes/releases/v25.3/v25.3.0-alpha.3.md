<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- CockroachDB can now synchronize SQL role membership from the groups claim contained in a JWT when the cluster setting `server.jwt_authentication.authorization.enabled` is set to `true`.  The claim name and the fallback `userinfo` JSON key are configurable by the cluster settings `server.jwt_authentication.group_claim` and `server.jwt_authentication.userinfo_group_key` respectively. This behavior matches the existing LDAP role-sync feature. [#147318][#147318]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused a routine with an `INSERT` statement to unnecessarily block dropping a hash-sharded index or computed column on the target table. This fix applies only to newly created routines. In releases prior to v25.3, the fix must be enabled by setting the session variable `use_improved_routine_dependency_tracking` to `on`. [#146250][#146250]
- Partial indexes can now reference user-defined functions. [#147817][#147817]
- Computed column expressions and `ON UPDATE` expressions can now reference user-defined functions. [#147817][#147817]
- `IMPORT TABLE` as well `PGDUMP` and `MYSQLDUMP` formats of `IMPORT` are now fully removed. These have been deprecated since v23.2. [#148248][#148248]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Removed the stale `--oss` flag from the `dev ui watch` subcommand. This flag was no longer in use, as the UI development workflow now exclusively targets the CCL build. This change simplifies the tool by removing an unused build path and potential confusion for developers. [#147978][#147978]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that allowed a column to be dropped from a table even if it was referenced in the `RETURNING` clause of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement in a routine. In releases prior to v25.3, the fix must be enabled by setting the session variable `use_improved_routine_dependency_tracking` to `on`. [#146250][#146250]
- Fixed a bug where `libpq` clients using the async API could hang with large result sets (Python: psycopg; Ruby: ActiveRecord, ruby-pg). [#148222][#148222]
- Restore no longer gets stuck in the `reverting` state after failed cleanup of dropped temporary system tables.
