- CockroachDB can now synchronise SQL
  role membership from the groups claim contained in a JWT when
  `server.jwt_authentication.authorization.enabled = true`.  The claim
  name and the fallback *userinfo* JSON key are configurable by
  `server.jwt_authentication.group_claim` and
  `server.jwt_authentication.userinfo_group_key` respectively.
  Behaviour matches the existing LDAP role-sync feature.
  .
  Common IdP examples
  -------------------
  - Okta (default mapping)
    SET CLUSTER SETTING server.jwt_authentication.group_claim = 'groups';
    SET CLUSTER SETTING server.jwt_authentication.userinfo_group_key = 'groups';
    .
  - Keycloak
    If you map Keycloak Groups to a JWT claim (default):
    group_claim = 'groups'             -- e.g. "groups": ["team-a","team-b"]
    .
    If you prefer Keycloakâ€™s built-in realm roles, CockroachDB does not follow
    nested paths like "realm_access.roles".  Add a Keycloak protocol mapper that
    flattens roles into a top-level claim (for example "roles") and then
    configure:
    group_claim = 'roles';             -- e.g. "roles": ["team-a","team-b"]
    .
    The userinfo endpoint usually returns the same JSON keys, so the same values
    work for `userinfo_group_key` as well. [#147318][#147318]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused a routine with an `INSERT` statement to unnecessarily block dropping a hash-sharded index or computed column on the target table. This fix applies only to newly created routines. In releases prior to v25.3, the fix must be enabled by setting the session variable `use_improved_routine_dependency_tracking` to `on`.
 [#146250][#146250]
- Partial indexes can now reference user-defined functions.
 [#147817][#147817]
- Computed column expressions and `ON UPDATE` expressions can now reference user-defined functions.
 [#147817][#147817]
- IMPORT TABLE as well PGDUMP and MYSQLDUMP
  formats of IMPORT are now fully removed. These have been deprecated
  since 23.2. [#148248][#148248]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Removed the stale `--oss` flag from the `dev ui watch` subcommand. This flag was no longer in use, as the UI development workflow now exclusively targets the CCL build. This change simplifies the tool by removing an unused build path and potential confusion for developers. [#147978][#147978]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that allowed a column to be dropped from a table even if it was referenced in the `RETURNING` clause of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement in a routine. In releases prior to v25.3, the fix must be enabled by setting the session variable `use_improved_routine_dependency_tracking` to `on`.
 [#146250][#146250]
- Fixed a bug where `libpq` clients using the async API could hang with large result sets (Python: psycopg; Ruby: ActiveRecord, ruby-pg).
 [#148222][#148222]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-alpha-3-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- Restore no longer gets stuck in the reverting state after failed cleanup of dropped temporary system tables.
