<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB now prohibits `ORDER BY` and join equality operations on `REFCURSOR` types, matching PostgreSQL behavior.
 [#149292][#149292]
- Fixed an issue where CockroachDB could hit an internal error when performing a `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, or `UPSERT` where the initial scan of the mutation is locking and is on a table different from the one being mutated. A possible workaround was `SET enable_implicit_select_for_update = false`, but this could increase contention. The bug was introduced in v25.2 and is now fixed.
