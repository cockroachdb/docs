<h3 id="v25-3-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixes a bug where the job responsible for
  compacting stats for the SQL activity state could enter an unschedulable
  state.
  Fixes: #155165 [#155964][#155964]
- Previously, CockroachDB didn't include reads and
  writes performed by routines (user-defined functions and stored
  procedures) as well as apply joins into `bytes read`, `rows read`, and
  `rows written` statement execution statistics, and this is now fixed.
  The bug has been present since before 23.2 version. [#156501][#156501]
- A bug where changefeeds using CDC
  queries could sometimes unexpectedly fail after a schema
  change with a descriptor retrieval error has been fixed. [#156551][#156551]
