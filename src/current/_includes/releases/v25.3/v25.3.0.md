This is available via a <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v25.3/prometheus-endpoint#metrics">new scrape endpoint</a>: <code>/metrics</code>.

It can be enabled through a cluster setting.
    </p>  
    <p class="feature-description">
      This optimization reduces <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/dev/architecture/storage-layer#write-amplification">write-amplification</a>—the ratio of total bytes written to disk versus the bytes written to database—by up to 50%. It reduces the write-bandwidth needed per database write operation, and CPU needed for compaction, improving overall write throughput.
    </p>
    <p class="feature-description">
      Traditionally, both keys and values are stored inline in SSTables. When value separation is enabled, some values are stored outside SSTables in external blob files. When a value is separated, the SSTable contains a value pointer describing the location of the value in an external blob file. During compaction, only the key and its value pointer are copied from one level to another, conserving write bandwidth when values are large.

    <p class="feature-description">Key benefits include:
    <ul>
    <li>Enhanced Security: Centralized user management improves security policy enforcement and reduces manual error risks.</li>
    <li>Increased Efficiency: Automates user provisioning, de-provisioning, and role assignments.</li>
    <li>Simplified Auditing: Provides a single source of truth for user identities.</li>
    <li>Reduced Overhead: Eliminates separate SQL user management processes. This integration allows the entire SQL user lifecycle to be managed from LDAP/AD systems, improving overall security and operational efficiency.</li>

This capability enhances flexibility when defining complex views by enabling calls to both SQL and PL/pgSQL routines, making it easier to encapsulate business logic and maintain cleaner schemas. The feature also improves compatibility with PostgreSQL, simplifying the process of migrating existing applications that rely on function- or procedure-based view logic.

      This release introduces <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/egress-perimeter-controls">Egress Perimeter Controls</a> for CockroachDB Cloud Advanced clusters on Microsoft Azure, specifically designed to support <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/pci-dss">PCI DSS</a> compliance. This feature is in <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v25.3/cockroachdb-feature-availability">Preview</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="feature-description">
      This feature enables customers to restrict outbound network traffic from their CockroachDB Cloud cluster to a predefined list of external destinations. This is a critical control for organizations handling cardholder data, as it helps meet PCI DSS Requirement 1.2.1 and 1.3.4, which mandate limiting inbound and outbound traffic to only that which is necessary and explicitly denying all other unauthorized egress.
    </p>
    
    <p class="feature-description">Key features and benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced Security: Granular control over outbound network connections from your CockroachDB cluster, minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized data exfiltration.</li>
      <li>PCI DSS Compliance: Directly addresses specific PCI DSS requirements (e.g., controlling and restricting egress traffic), assisting organizations in achieving and maintaining compliance for their cardholder data environments (CDE).</li>
      <li>Data Protection: Ensures that sensitive data egress, such as backups or change data capture (CDC), is confined to approved, secure destinations.</li>
      <li>Reduced Risk: Mitigates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access by enforcing strict network boundaries around your database.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="feature-description">
      This functionality provides a vital security layer for customers operating under stringent regulatory requirements like PCI DSS on Azure, enabling a more secure and compliant cloud database environment.

    <p class="feature-description">
      CMEK enables customers to control the encryption keys used to protect their data at rest within CockroachDB Cloud on Azure. Keys are managed via the customer's Azure Key Vault.

    <p class="feature-description">Key benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced Data Security: Customers control key lifecycle (creation, rotation, revocation), improving data protection.</li>
      <li>PCI DSS Compliance: Addresses PCI DSS Requirement 3 for protecting stored cardholder data.</li>
      <li>Operational Control: Provides greater control and visibility over data encryption strategy.</li>
