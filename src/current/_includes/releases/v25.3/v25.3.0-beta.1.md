Release Date: June 30, 2025

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Directionality may no longer be assigned to any vector index column. Prefix columns are not scannable in a vector index, so directionality is not relevant to them.
 [#147307][#147307]
- Changed the basic sequence caching option to cache at the per-node level by default. The `PER SESSION CACHE` sequence option is added to provide the previous per-session cache behavior.
 [#148290][#148290]
- Removed the 'started' column in `SHOW JOBS`, which was a duplicate of the 'created' column.
 [#148464][#148464]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Introduced the following cluster settings for enabling and configuring value separation in the storage engine: `storage.value_separation.enabled`, `storage.value_separation.minimum_size`, and `storage.value_separation.max_reference_depth`.
 [#148535][#148535]
- Non-admin users no longer have access to changefeed jobs they do not own and which are not owned by a role of which they are a member, regardless of whether they have the `CHANGEFEED` privilege on the table or tables those jobs may be watching. Admin users, or those with global `SHOWJOB` / `CONTROLJOB` privileges, can still interact with all jobs, regardless of ownership.
 [#148537][#148537]
- In order to selectively capture
  traces for transactions running in an active workload without haing
  to capture them via statement diagnostic bundles, customers can now
  use the `sql.trace.txn.sample_rate` cluster setting to enable tracing
  for a fraction of their workload. The `sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold`
  will still need to be set to a positive value to provide a filter
  for how slow a transaction needs to be after being sampled to merit
  emitting a trace. Traces are emitted to the `SQL_EXEC` logging
  channel. [#148542][#148542]
- Added the following cluster settings for configuring blob file rewrite compactions: `storage.value_separation.rewrite_minimum_age` and `storage.value_separation.compaction_garbage_threshold`.
 [#148837][#148837]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where using column families on tables with vector indexes would cause the index to fail to return results.
 [#147307][#147307]
- Large mutation statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `UPSERT`) are now less likely to encounter contention with automatic table statistics collection in some cases. The bug was present since v19.1.
 [#148488][#148488]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The optimizer will no longer apply a fast-path to deletes cascading to `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables. This prevents the cascading delete from accessing more regions than necessary.
 [#148105][#148105]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- The `replicas.cpunanospersecond` metric was added. Notably, when child labels are enabled, it exposes evaluation-related Replica CPU usage by tenant.
 [#146526][#146526]
- CockroachDB now raises an error when encountering improper
  inline SSL credentials instead of panicking. [#148242][#148242]
- Restore will now re-attempt `AdminSplit` KV requests
  instead of immediately failing and pausing the job. [#148484][#148484]
- To improve changefeed performance, the session variable `create_table_with_schema_locked` is enabled by default. This means all new tables are created with the `schema_locked` storage parameter. This setting must be explicitly unset for explicit transactions or for schema changes that do not support automatic disabling (e.g., `ALTER TABLE ... SET LOCALITY`).
