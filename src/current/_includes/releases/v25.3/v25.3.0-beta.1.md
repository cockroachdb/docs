<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Directionality may no longer be assigned to any vector index column. Prefix columns are not scannable in a vector index, so directionality is not relevant to them.
 [#147307][#147307]
- Changed the basic sequence caching option to cache at the per-node level by default. The `PER SESSION CACHE` sequence option is added to provide the previous per-session cache behavior.
 [#148290][#148290]
- Removed the 'started' column in `SHOW JOBS`, which was a duplicate of the 'created' column.
 [#148464][#148464]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Introduced the following cluster settings for enabling and configuring [value separation in the storage engine]({% link v25.3/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#value-separation): `storage.value_separation.enabled`, `storage.value_separation.minimum_size`, and `storage.value_separation.max_reference_depth`.
 [#148535][#148535]
- Non-admin users no longer have access to changefeed jobs they do not own and which are not owned by a role of which they are a member, regardless of whether they have the `CHANGEFEED` privilege on the table or tables those jobs may be watching. Admin users, or those with global `SHOWJOB` / `CONTROLJOB` privileges, can still interact with all jobs, regardless of ownership.
 [#148537][#148537]
- In order to selectively capture traces for transactions running in an active workload without having to capture them via statement diagnostic bundles, customers can now use the `sql.trace.txn.sample_rate` cluster setting to enable tracing for a fraction of their workload. The `sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold` will still need to be set to a positive value to provide a filter for how slow a transaction needs to be after being sampled to merit emitting a trace. Traces are emitted to the `SQL_EXEC` logging channel.
  [#148542][#148542]
- Added the following cluster settings for configuring blob file rewrite compactions: `storage.value_separation.rewrite_minimum_age` and `storage.value_separation.compaction_garbage_threshold`.
  [#148837][#148837]
- Added the `replicas.cpunanospersecond` metric. Notably, when child labels are enabled, this metric exposes evaluation-related Replica CPU usage by tenant.
  [#146526][#146526]
- CockroachDB now raises an error when encountering improper inline SSL credentials instead of panicking.
  [#148242][#148242]
- Restore will now re-attempt `AdminSplit` KV requests instead of immediately failing and pausing the job.
  [#148484][#148484]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where using column families on tables with vector indexes would cause the index to fail to return results.
 [#147307][#147307]
- Large mutation statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `UPSERT`) are now less likely to encounter contention with automatic table statistics collection in some cases. The bug was present since v19.1.
 [#148488][#148488]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The optimizer will no longer apply a fast-path to deletes cascading to `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables. This prevents the cascading delete from accessing more regions than necessary.
