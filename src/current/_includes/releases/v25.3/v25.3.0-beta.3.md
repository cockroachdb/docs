<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added support for invoking a UDF from a view query. Renaming or setting the schema on the routine is currently not allowed if it is referenced by a view.
 [#149514][#149514]
- The session setting `optimizer_prefer_bounded_cardinality` is now enabled by default. This setting instructs the optimizer to prefer query plans where every expression has a guaranteed upper-bound on the number of rows it will process.
 [#149675][#149675]

<h3 id="v25-3-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that would cause a `CALL` statement executed via a portal in the extended wire protocol to result in an error like `unknown portal ""` if the stored procedure contained `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statements. The bug had existed since PL/pgSQL transaction control statements were introduced in v24.1. The fix is off by default in versions prior to v25.3.
 [#149385][#149385]
- In v25.1, automatic partial statistics collection was enabled by default (by setting the `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection.enabled` cluster setting to `true`). Partial statistics collection may encounter certain expected scenarios that were previously reported as failed stats jobs with PostgreSQL error code `55000`. These errors are benign and are no longer reported. Instead, the stats job will be marked as "succeeded," though no new statistics will be created.
