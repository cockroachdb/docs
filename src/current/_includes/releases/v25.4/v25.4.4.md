Release Date: February 11, 2026

<h3 id="v25-4-4-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Changefeeds now support the `partition_alg`
  option for specifying a kafka partitioning algorithm. Currently `fnv-1a`
  (default) and `murmur2` are supported. The option is only valid on kafka
  v2 sinks. This is protected by the cluster setting
  `changefeed.partition_alg.enabled`. An example usage: `SET CLUSTER SETTING
  changefeed.partition_alg.enabled=true; CREATE CHANGEFEED ... INTO
  'kafka://...' WITH partition_alg='murmur2';` Note that if a changefeed is
  created using the murmur2 algorithm, and then the cluster setting is
  disabled, the changefeed will continue using the murmur2 algorithm
  unless the changefeed is altered to use a differed `partition_alg`. [#161534][#161534]

- The **SQL Activity** > **Sessions** page now defaults the **Session Status** filter to **Active, Idle** to exclude closed sessions. [#160936][#160936]

<h3 id="v25-4-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where renaming a column that participated in multiple hash-sharded indexes would fail. [#160087][#160087]
- Fixed a bug that caused `SHOW CREATE FUNCTION` to error when the function body contained casts from columns to user-defined types. [#160125][#160125]
- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when a statistics creation task panicked. [#160421][#160421]
- Fixed a bug where rolling back a transaction that had just rolled back a savepoint would block other transactions accessing the same rows for five seconds. [#160476][#160476]
- Fixed a bug where IMPORT with AVRO data using OCF format could silently lose data if the underlying storage (e.g., S3) returned an error during read. Such errors are now properly reported. Other formats (specified via `data_as_binary_records` and `data_as_json_records` options) are unaffected. The bug has been present since about v20.1. [#161324][#161324]
- Previously, if buffered writes were enabled
  (which is a public preview feature, off by default), multi-stmt explicit
  txns that use SAVEPOINTs to recover from certain errors (like duplicate
  key value violations) could lose the writes that were performed _before_
  the savepoint was created in rare cases. The bug has been present since
  the buffered writes feature was added in 25.2 and is now fixed. [#162033][#162033]
- Fixed an error that occurred when using generic
  plan that generates a lookup join on indexes containing identity
  computed columns. [#162290][#162290]

<h3 id="v25-4-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Added a new session variable, `distsql_prevent_partitioning_soft_limited_scans`, which, when true, prevents scans with soft limits from being planned as multiple TableReaders by the physical planner. This should decrease the initial setup costs of some fully-distributed query plans. [#160628][#160628]

<h3 id="v25-4-4-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Replaces bors with Trunk merge queue for better performance and reliability. Configuration-only change with no runtime impact - maintains same safety checks while improving CI workflow. [#161243][#161243]
