<h3 id="v25-4-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A bug has been fixed that caused internal errors
  for `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT .. DO UPDATE` statements when the target
  table had both a computed column and a `BEFORE` trigger. This bug has
  been present since triggers were introduced in v24.3.0. [#155077][#155077]
