<h3 id="v25-4-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an error that occurred when using generic
  plan that generates a lookup join on indexes containing identity
  computed columns. [#162290][#162290]
- Fixed a rare race condition between range splits and MVCC garbage collection where a GCRequest could target keys outside its declared span. In rare cases, this could result in data on the post-split right-hand side (RHS) being incorrectly garbage collected, potentially leading to lost writes. The system now detects and rejects such malformed GC requests. [#163772][#163772]
- Fixed a bug where generating a debug zip could trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition on a node if malformed log entries were present in logs using json or json-compact formatting. Debug zip generation now safely handles malformed log lines and prevents excessive memory consumption. [#163802][#163802]
