<h3 id="v25-4-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an error that occurred when using generic
  plan that generates a lookup join on indexes containing identity
  computed columns. [#162290][#162290]
- Fixes a bug where generating a debug zip causes
  a node to OOM. This OOM happens when a log file contains a malformed
  log and is using json (or json-compact) formatting. [#163802][#163802]
