<h3 id="v25-4-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The background (elastic) store graphs for exhausted duration, and the wait duration histogram, have been separated from the foreground (regular) graphs. [#156869][#156869]

<h3 id="v25-4-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A mechanism that prevents unsafe replication changes from causing loss of quorum now functions correctly. An internal function has been fixed to properly return errors, enhancing the reliability of replication safeguards. [#156523][#156523]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could encounter a `vector encoder doesn't support ForcePut yet` error when executing `COPY` commands concurrently with certain schema changes. The bug had existed since before v23.2. [#157200][#157200]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a schema change to be stuck in the reverting state if the `infer_rbr_region_col_using_constraint` storage parameter was being set at the same time as adding a constraint that had a foreign key violation. [#157844][#157844]
