- The background (elastic) store graphs for exhausted duration, and the wait duration histogram have been separated from the foreground (regular) graphs. [#156869][#156869]

<h3 id="v25-4-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A mechanism that blocks replication changes that would result in a loss of quorum was ineffective. It now works as intended. [#156523][#156523]
- CockroachDB could previously encounter "vector encoder doesn't support ForcePut yet" error when performing COPY command concurrently with some schema changes. The bug has been present since before 23.2 and is now fixed. [#157200][#157200]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a schema change to be stuck in the reverting state if the infer_rbr_region_col_using_constraint storage parameter was being set at the same time as adding a constraint that had a foreign key violation. [#157844][#157844]
