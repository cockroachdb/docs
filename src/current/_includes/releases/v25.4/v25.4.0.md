    <p class="feature-description" markdown="1">
      Vector indexes in CockroachDB now support table backfills, making it easy to add vector indexes to existing tables without requiring manual data rewrites or service interruption. This update enhances the usability of vector search features by allowing seamless indexing of pre-existing data. Additionally, support for both cosine distance and inner product has been added, giving users more flexibility in selecting similarity metrics that best suit their machine learning or AI workloads. Together, these improvements make it easier to build and scale intelligent applications directly on CockroachDB.

    <p class="feature-description" markdown="1">
      This release introduces the Metrics Viewer role on CockroachDB Cloud, providing dedicated permissions for metrics collection and insights. This role is designed to enhance overall security by enabling granular access control to cluster performance data.

      The Metrics Viewer role grants read-only access to cluster metrics and related insights, without conferring any administrative or data manipulation privileges.
    </p>
    <p class="feature-description">Key benefits:</p>
    <ul class="feature-description">
      <li>Improved Security: Enables the principle of least privilege by allowing users or services to monitor cluster performance without broader access to sensitive data or configuration.</li>
      <li>Targeted Access: Provides focused access to operational metrics, empowering teams to monitor health and performance efficiently.</li>
      <li>Enhanced Collaboration: Facilitates secure collaboration by allowing different teams (e.g., SREs, developers) to access relevant metrics without over-provisioned permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="feature-description">When combined with the existing Cluster Developer role, a user can effectively gain "Power Developer" like functionalities, enabling them to develop applications and monitor their performance comprehensively while maintaining a clear separation of privileges for security.</p>
