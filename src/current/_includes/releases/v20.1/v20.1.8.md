<h3 id="v20-1-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [schema changes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/online-schema-changes), which affect referenced tables, might not have propagated to other nodes. [#55375][#55375]
- Fixed a bug where inscrutable errors were returned on failed [backup creation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/backup). [#54968][#54968]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB crashed when [executing a query via the vectorized engine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/vectorized-execution) when most of the SQL memory (determined via [`--max-sql-memory`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/cockroach-start#flags) startup argument) had already been reserved. [#55458][#55458]
- Fixed a bug where the [`age()`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/functions-and-operators#date-and-time-functions) function did not normalize the duration for large day or H:M:S values in the same way PostgreSQL does. [#55527][#55527]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB did not account for all the memory used by the vectorized hash aggregation which could lead to an OOM crash. [#55571][#55571]
- Fixed a bug where using the `MIN`/`MAX` aggregates in a prepared statement did not report the correct [data type](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/data-types) size. [#55621][#55621]
