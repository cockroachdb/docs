<h3 id="v24-1-0-beta-2-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Added the [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) `security.client_cert.subject_required.enabled` that enforces a mandatory requirement for the client certificate's role subject to be set. The subject can be defined through either the subject role option or by specifying the `root-cert-distinguished-name` and `node-cert-distinguished-name` properties. This setting applies to both RPC access and login via authCert. [#122368][#122368]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where table statistics were sometimes not collected on tables that have virtual [computed columns]({% link v24.1/computed-columns.md %}) of a user-defined type when the `sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled` cluster setting is enabled. The setting was introduced in v23.2.4 and is disabled by default. Only clusters running v23.2.4 with the non-default setting are affected. [#122320][#122320]
