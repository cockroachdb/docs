<h3 id="v24-1-0-beta-2-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- We are adding a cluster setting `security.client_cert.subject_required.enabled` which mandates a requirement for role subject to be set either through subject role option or root-cert-distinguished-name and node-cert-distinguished-name. It controls both RPC access and login via authCert. [#122368][#122368]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Adds a new timeseries metric storage.sstable.zombie.bytes. [#122211][#122211]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB could fail to collect table statistics on tables that have virtual computed columns of user-defined type if `sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled` cluster setting is enabled. The setting is introduced in 23.2.4 version and is disabled by default, so only this particular version is affected with non-default setting. [#122320][#122320]
