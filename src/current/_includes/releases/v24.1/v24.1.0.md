<h4 id="v24-1-0-enterprise-features" markdown="1">Enterprise features</h4>

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The following are [enterprise-only](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/enterprise-licensing) features. [Request a 30-day trial license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/) to try them out.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

- The [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.1/read-committed.md %}) isolation level now requires the cluster to have a valid [enterprise license](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/licensing-faqs#obtain-a-license). Otherwise, transactions which are configured to run as `READ COMMITTED` will be upgraded to [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.1/demo-serializable.md %}), as described in [Backward-incompatible changes](#read-committed-transaction-upgrade). [#120154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/120154)

<h4 id="v24-1-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v24.1]({% link v24.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as [key cluster setting changes](#v24-1-0-cluster-settings), and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`]({% link v23.2/as-of-system-time.md %}) queries can no longer use a timestamp followed by a question mark to signify a future-time value. This was an undocumented syntax. [#116830](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/116830)
- The [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.1/read-committed.md %}) isolation level now requires the cluster to have a valid [enterprise license](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/licensing-faqs#obtain-a-license). Otherwise, transactions which are configured to run as `READ COMMITTED` will be upgraded to [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.1/demo-serializable.md %}), as described in the next note. [#120154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/120154)
- <a id="read-committed-transaction-upgrade"></a>The `sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) is now `true` by default. As a result, [`READ COMMITTED`]({% link v24.1/read-committed.md %}) transactions are **not** automatically upgraded to [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.1/demo-serializable.md %}), and will run as `READ COMMITTED` by default. On v23.2, refer to the [**Upgrades of SQL Transaction Isolation Level**]({% link v24.1/ui-sql-dashboard.md %}#upgrades-of-sql-transaction-isolation-level) graph in the DB Console to check whether any transaction is being upgraded from a weaker isolation level to `SERIALIZABLE`, and could therefore run differently on v24.1. [#118479](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/118479)

<h4 id="v24-1-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.

- TBD

<h4 id="v24-1-0-deprecations">Deprecations</h4>

{% comment %}TODO: Intro para? Each sibling section has one.{% endcomment %}

- `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable` is now deprecated. Instead, use the new [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy`. `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy='balanced_simple'` has the same effect as setting `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable=true`. It does not require `initial_scan='only'`, which was required by the old setting. [#115166][#115166]
- The `cockroach connect` command has been removed. This command was [deprecated]({% link releases/v23.2.md %}#v23-2-0-deprecations) in CockroachDB v23.2. [#113893][#113893]
