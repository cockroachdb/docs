- Fixed a bug in v22.2+ where long running initial scans may incorrectly restore checkpoint job progress and drop events during node / changefeed restart. This issue was most likely to occur in clusters with: 1) changefeed.shutdown_checkpoint.enabled (v23.2) is set 2) Multiple table targets in a changefeed, or 3) Low changefeed.frontier_checkpoint_frequency or low changefeed.frontier_highwater_lag_checkpoint_threshold.

- Fix a crash introduced in v24.1.0-beta.2 that could occur when planning statistics collection on a table with a virtual computed column using a user-defined type when the newly-introduced cluster setting `sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled` is set to true. (The setting was introduced in v24.1.0-alpha.1 default true.) [#124064][#124064]
