## v24.1.8

Release Date: December 12, 2024

<h3 id="v24-1-8-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- All cluster settings that accept strings are now fully redacted when transmitted as part of our diagnostics telemetry. The transmitted payload includes a record of modified cluster settings and their values when they are not strings. If you previously applied the mitigations in [Technical Advisory 133479]({% link advisories/a133479.md %}), you can safely set the value of cluster setting `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` to false and turn on diagnostic reporting via the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` cluster setting without leaking sensitive cluster settings values. [#134016][#134016]

<h3 id="v24-1-8-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- `COCKROACH_SKIP_ENABLING_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORTING` is no longer mentioned in the `cockroach demo` command. [#134087][#134087]
- Added `system.users` to the list of system tables that changefeeds protect with protected timestamps (PTS). This table is required for change data capture queries. [#134836][#134836]
- Added changefeed support for the `mvcc_timestamp` option with the `avro` format. If both options are specified, the `avro` schema includes an `mvcc_timestamp` metadata field and emits the row's MVCC timestamp with the row data. [#136482][#136482]

<h3 id="v24-1-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- To prevent unnecessary queuing in admission control CPU queues, the `goschedstats.always_use_short_sample_period.enabled` setting should be set to `true` for any production cluster. [#133583][#133583]
- A new cluster setting `ui.database_locality_metadata.enabled`, when set to `true`, disables loading database and table region information in the DB Console Database and Table pages. This information can cause significant CPU load on large clusters with many ranges. The Database and Table pages in v24.3 onwards do not have this problem. If you require this data, use the `SHOW RANGES FROM {DATABASE|TABLE}` SQL statement to compute this information on-demand. [#134094][#134094]
- The row-level TTL job now will periodically log progress by showing the number of table spans that have been processed so far. [#135179][#135179]

<h3 id="v24-1-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could encounter an internal error `interface conversion: coldata.Column is` in an edge case. The bug was present in v22.2.13+, v23.1.9+, and v23.2+. [#133760][#133760]
- Fixed an unhandled error that could occur when using `REVOKE ... ON SEQUENCE ... FROM user` on an object that is not a sequence. [#133708][#133708]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect `NOT NULL` constraint violation errors on `UPSERT` and `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` statements when those statements updated an existing row and a subset of columns that did not include a `NOT NULL` column of the table. This bug had been present since at least v20.1.0. [#133822][#133822]
- Addressed a panic that could occur inside `CREATE TABLE AS` if sequence builtin expressions had invalid function overloads. [#133868][#133868]
- String constants can now be compared against collated strings. [#134105][#134105]
- Previously, when executing queries with index / lookup joins where ordering needed to be maintained, CockroachDB's behavior could lead to increased query latency, potentially by several orders of magnitude. This bug was introduced in v22.2, and is now fixed. [#134365][#134365]
- Fixed a bug where `DISCARD ALL` statements were counted under the `sql.ddl.count` metric. Now these statements will be counted under the `sql.misc.count` metric. [#134508][#134508]
- Fixed a bug where `DROP CASCADE` would occasionally panic with an `un-dropped backref` message on partitioned tables. [#134522][#134522]
- Reduced the duration of partitions in the gossip network when a node crashes. This eliminates false positives in the `ranges.unavailable` metric. [#134601][#134601]
- As a non-admin user who runs `DROP ROLE IF EXISTS` on a user that does not exist, you no longer get an error message. [#134968][#134968]
- Fixed a bug that caused quotes around the name of a routine to be dropped when the routine was called within another routine. This could prevent the correct routine name from being resolved if the nested routine name was case-sensitive. The bug has existed since v24.1, when nested routines were introduced. [#134001][#134001]
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect query results when the optimizer planned a lookup join on an index containing a column of type `CHAR(N)`, `VARCHAR(N)`, `BIT(N)`, `VARBIT(N)`, or `DECIMAL(M, N)`, and the query held that column constant to a single value (for example, with an equality filter). [#135111][#135111]
- Fixed an unhandled error that would occur if `DROP SCHEMA` was executed on the `public` schema of the `system` database, or on an internal schema, such as `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. [#135195][#135195]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect evaluation of some binary expressions involving `CHAR(N)` values and untyped string literals with trailing whitespace characters. For example, the expression `'f'::CHAR = 'f '` now correctly evaluates to `true`. [#135690][#135690]
- `CREATE SCHEMA` now returns the correct error if a the schema name is missing. [#135926][#135926]

<h3 id="v24-1-8-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Unnecessary block loads of SSTable files are now avoided in some rare cases after a replica rebalance. [#134541][#134541]
