<h3 id="v24-1-23-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Backporting detailed error logging logic
  gated behind a cluster setting. The cluster setting  enables detailed
  error logging for messages exceeding Kafka v2 size limit. [#150183][#150183]
- Changefeeds emitting to Kafka sinks that were created in CockroachDB v24.2.1+, or v23.2.10+ and v24.1.4+ with the `changefeed.new_kafka_sink.enabled` cluster setting enabled now include the message key, size, and MVCC timestamp in "message too large" error logs. [#150183][#150183]

<h3 id="v24-1-23-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an issue where the `mvcc_timestamp` field was incorrectly returning zero values when used with CDC queries. The timestamp is now emitted correctly. [#147110][#147110]
- Fixed a bug that could cause some errors returned by attempts to upload backup data to external storage providers to be undetected, potentially causing incomplete backups. [#151083][#151083]
