<h3 id="v24-1-7-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Add sink error metric (`changefeed.sink_errors`) and expand reporting of internal retries metric (`changefeed.internal_retry_message_count`) to all sinks that perform internal retries. [#132352][#132352]
- Added a timer for inner sink client flushes. Fixed a bug where timers were not correctly registered with the metric system. [#133196][#133196]
- Allowed access to DB console APIs via JWT, which can be supplied as a Bearer token in Authorization header. [#133536][#133536]

<h3 id="v24-1-7-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Some metric charts on the overview and replication pages have more terse legends to facilitate easier browsing. [#129358][#129358]
- DB Console will reflect any throttling behavior from the cluster due to an expired license or missing telemetry data. Enterprise licenses are not affected. [#132091][#132091]
- Due to the inaccuracy of the "Range Count" column on the "Databases" page and the cost incurred to fetch the correct range count for every database in a cluster, this data will no longer be visible. This data is still available via a `SHOW RANGES` query. [#133269][#133269]

<h3 id="v24-1-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where the CLI would not correctly escape JSON values that had double-quotes inside of a string when using the --format=sql flag. [#131930][#131930]
- Fixed an error that could happen if an aggregate function was used as the value in a SET command. [#131959][#131959]
- Add automated clean-up/validation for dropped roles inside of default privileges. [#132135][#132135]
- Fix a bug that could cause RESTORE to hang after encountering transient errors from the storage layer.  Epic: none. [#132259][#132259]
- Addressed a rare bug that could prevent backups taken during a DROP COLUMN operation with a sequence owner from restoring with the error: "rewriting descriptor ids: missing rewrite for <id> in SequenceOwner..." [#132325][#132325]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect evaluation of `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `IF` expressions with branches producing fixed-width string-like types, such as `CHAR`. In addition, the `BPCHAR` type has been fixed so that it no longer incorrectly imposes a length limit of 1. [#130890][#130890]
- Fixed a bug existing since before v23.1 which could lead to incorrect results in rare cases. The bug requires a join between two tables, with an equality between columns with equivalent but not identical types (e.g. OID and REGCLASS). In addition, the join must lookup into an index that includes a computed column that references one of the equivalent columns. [#132509][#132509]
- Fixed a bug existing since before v23.1 which could lead to incorrect results in rare cases. The bug requires a lookup join into a table with a computed index column, where the computed column expression is composite sensitive. A composite sensitive expression can compare differently if supplied non-identical but equivalent input values (e.g. `2.0::DECIMAL` vs `2.00::DECIMAL`). [#132509][#132509]
- Fixes a bug where a span stats request on a mixed version cluster resulted in an NPE [#132681][#132681]
- The franz-go library has been updated to fix a potential deadlock on changefeed restarts. [#132785][#132785]
- Fixed an issue where changefeeds would fail to update protected timestamp records in the face of retryable errors. [#132775][#132775]
- Fix a bug which could result in changefeeds using cdc queries failing due to a system table being GC'd. [#131648][#131648]
- Fix a rare bug in which an update of a primary key column which is also the only column in a separate column family can sometimes fail to update the primary index. This bug has existed since v22.2. Requirements to hit the bug are:  1. A table with multiple column families. 2. A column family containing a single PK column. 3. That column family is not the first column family. 4. That column family existed before its column was in the PK. 5. That column must be of type FLOAT4/8, DECIMAL, JSON, collated string    type, or array. 6. An update that changes that column from a composite value to a non-    composite value. [#132122][#132122]
- The proretset column of the pg_catalog.pg_proc table is now properly set to true for set-returning builtin functions. [#132875][#132875]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause incorrect evaluation of scalar expressions involving `NULL` values in rare cases. [#132947][#132947]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause incorrect evaluation of scalar expressions involving NULL values in rare cases. [#132947][#132947]
- A bug in the query optimizer which could cause CockroachDB nodes to crash in rare cases has been fixed. The bug could occur when a query contains a filter in the form `col IN (elem0, elem1, ..., elemN)` only when `N` is very large, e.g., 1.6+ million, and when `col` exists in a hash-sharded index or exists a table with an indexed, computed column dependent on `col`. [#133065][#133065]
- Users with the admin role can now run `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR target_role ...` on any target_role. Previously, this could result in a privilege error, which is incorrect as admins are allowed to perform any operation. [#133070][#133070]
- REASSIGN OWNED BY will now transfer ownership of the public schema. Previously, it would always skip over the public schema even if it was owned by the target role. [#133070][#133070]

<h3 id="v24-1-7-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Reduce the write-amplification impact of rebalances by splitting snapshot sstable files into smaller ones before ingesting them into Pebble. [#129018][#129018]
- Enhanced performance when schema_locked is not in use by improving error handling during periodic table history polling.  ``` ❯ benchstat before.txt after.txt goos: darwin goarch: arm64                                         │  before.txt  │              after.txt               │                                         │    sec/op    │    sec/op     vs base                │ PauseOrResumePolling/non-terminal_error    5.533µ ± 5%   3.849µ ± 29%  -30.44% (p=0.000 n=10) PauseOrResumePolling/not_schema_locked    7069.5n ± 4%   176.4n ±  9%  -97.50% (p=0.000 n=10) PauseOrResumePolling/schema_locked         136.2n ± 4%   131.8n ±  7%        ~ (p=0.306 n=10) geomean                                    1.747µ        447.2n        -74.39% ``` [#132190][#132190]
