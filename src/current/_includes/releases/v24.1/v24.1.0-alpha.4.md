Release Date: March 25, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- When [configuring logs](../v24.1/configure-logs.html#output-to-files), `file-permissions` are now applied literally, such that `file-permissions: 644` will result in files with permissions matching `644` (instead of the previous behavior's `640`). Previously, CockroachDB's `umask` (which is always at least `007`) was being applied after the `file-permissions` field was used to create files, meaning the resulting permissions did not match those specified in the log configuration. [#120669][#120669]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The following [metrics](../v24.1/metrics.html) were added for observability of per-store disk events:
	- `storage.disk.read.count`
	- `storage.disk.read.bytes`
	- `storage.disk.read.time`
	- `storage.disk.write.count`
	- `storage.disk.write.bytes`
	- `storage.disk.write.time`
	- `storage.disk.io.time`
	- `storage.disk.weightedio.time`
	- `storage.disk.iopsinprogress`

	The metrics match the definitions of the `sys.host.disk.*` system metrics. [#119885][#119885]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- `server.controller.default_target_cluster` can now be set to any virtual cluster name by default, including a virtual cluster yet to be created or have service started. [#120080][#120080]
- The [`READ COMMITTED`](../v24.1/read-committed.html) isolation level now requires the cluster to have a valid enterprise license. [#120154][#120154]
- The new boolean changefeed option [`ignore_disable_changefeed_replication`](../v24.1/create-changefeed.html#ignore-disable-changefeed), when set to `true`, prevents the changefeed from filtering events even if CDC filtering is configured via the `disable_changefeed_replication` [session variable](../v24.1/session-variables.html), `sql.ttl.changefeed_replication.disabled` [cluster setting](../v24.1/cluster-settings.html), or the `ttl_disable_changefeed_replication` [table storage parameter](../v24.1/alter-table.html#table-storage-parameters). [#120255][#120255]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added support for the [PL/pgSQL](../v24.1/plpgsql.html) `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` statements. [#119647][#119647]
- [Identity columns](../v24.1/create-table.html#identity-columns) now support enhanced sequence management through the [`ALTER [COLUMN] column_name SET sequence_option`](../v24.1/alter-table.html#alter-column) and [`ALTER [COLUMN] column_name RESTART [WITH restart]`](../v24.1/alter-table.html#alter-column) commands. This update facilitates the fine-tuning of identity column sequences. [#119432][#119432]
- It is now possible to use the `STRICT` option with [`SELECT ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) and [`RETURNING ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) in order to enforce that a SQL statement within a [PL/pgSQL](../v24.1/plpgsql.html) routine returns exactly one row. [#120486][#120486]
- Added a [session setting](../v24.1/session-variables.html) `plpgsql_use_strict_into`, which causes PL/pgSQL [`SELECT ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) and [`RETURNING ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) to require exactly one row from the SQL statement, similar to Oracle behavior. [#120486][#120486]
- Added a new `failure_count INT NOT NULL` column to `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics`. It represents the number of recorded statement execution failures for the given statement, as a new component of the overall statistics. [#120236][#120236]
- The `FORCE_INVERTED_INDEX` hint causes the [optimizer](../v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) to prefer a query plan scan over any inverted index of the hinted table. An error is emitted if no such query plan can be generated. [#120384][#120384]
- The `REPAIRCLUSTERMETADATA` privilege has been aliased to  `REPAIRCLUSTER`. Both names can be used interchangeably. [#116844][#116844]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The [cluster setting](../v24.1/cluster-settings.html) `admission.wal.failover.unlimited_tokens.enabled` can be set to `true` to cause unlimited admission tokens during write-ahead log (WAL) failover. This should not be changed without significant expertise, since the default, which preserves the token counts from the preceding non-WAL-failover interval, is expected to be safer. [#120135][#120135]
- The new [`cockroach start`](../v24.1/cockroach-start.html) option `--wal-failover=among-stores` or `COCKROACH_WAL_FAILOVER=among-stores` environment variable will configure a multi-store CockroachDB node to fail over a store's write-ahead log (WAL) to another store's data directory. Failing over the write-ahead log may allow some operations against a store to continue to complete even if the underlying storage is temporarily unavailable. [#120509][#120509]
- The new `storage.wal_failover.unhealthy_op_threshold` [cluster setting](../v24.1/cluster-settings.html) allows configuring the latency threshold at which a WAL write is considered unhealthy. [#120509][#120509]
- Two new metrics track the status of the SQL Activity Update job, which pre-aggregates top K information within the SQL statistics subsytem and writes the results to `system.statement_activity` and `system.transaction_activity`:
	- `sql.stats.activity.updates.successful`: Number of successful updates made by the SQL activity updater job.
	- `sql.stats.activity.update.latency`: The latency of updates made by the SQL activity updater job. Includes failed update attempts. [#120522][#120522]
- Added a new counter metric, `sql.stats.flush.done_signals.ignored`, that tracks the number of times the SQL activity update job has ignored the signal that indicates that a flush has completed. This metric may indicate that the SQL activity update job is taking longer than expected to complete. [#120522][#120522]
- Added a new counter metric, `sql.stats.activity.updates.failed`, to measure the number of update attempts made by the SQL activity update job that failed with errors. [#120522][#120522]
- Added a new counter metric, `sql.stats.flush.fingerprint.count`, that tracks the number of unique statement and transaction fingerprints included in the SQL stats flush. [#120522][#120522]
- The `/_status/stores` endpoint now includes `node_id`, `dir`, and `wal_failover_path` fields to show the store's node ID, data directory, and path to the configured WAL failover secondary, if configured. [#120677][#120677]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The new `--go-gc-percent` flag of the [`cockroach start`](../v24.1/cockroach-start.html) command controls the garbage collection target percentage of the Go runtime, mirroring the existing `GOGC` environment variable. A garbage collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. If left unspecified and if a Go soft memory limit is configured (i.e., not explicitly disabled via `--max-go-memory` or `GOMEMLIMIT`), the garbage collection target percentage defaults to 300%. Setting the flag to a negative value disables  the target percentage garbage collection heuristic, and only the soft memory limit heuristic triggers garbage collection. [#119605][#119605]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**Queues** dashboard](../v24.1/ui-queues-dashboard.html) now includes lease queue metrics. [#119386][#119386]
- The DB Console **SQL Activity** [**Statement Fingerprint**](../v24.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprint-page) page has replaced the **Failed?** boolean column with a **Failure Count** column that shows the number of failed executions for the given statement fingerprint.<br /> In the **SQL Activity** table, the same statement fingeprint no longer appears in separate rows for failed executions and successful executions. Instead, they are combined into a single statement fingerprint. [#120236][#120236]
- The DB Console now displays an alert message when a license has expired or will expire in fewer than 15 days. [#120490][#120490]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug with [`DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`](../v24.1/drop-schema.html) that could lead to dangling function references in other schemas accessing any functions. [#119932][#119932]
- Fixed a bug where a [`RESTORE`](../v24.1/restore.html) of a backup that itself contained a table created by the `RESTORE` of a table with an in-progress [`IMPORT INTO`](../v24.1/import-into.html) would fail to restore all rows. [#120414][#120414]
- Fixed a bug where [identity columns](../v24.1/create-table.html#identity-columns) without any configured sequence options did not display the default values for identity attributes in `information_schema`. [#119459][#119459]
- Fixed a bug where a [`GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES`](../v24.1/grant.html) statement could fail if sequences existed and they did not support a privilege (e.g., `BACKUP`). [#120685][#120685]
- Fixed a bug where an [`EXPLAIN (DDL)`](../v24.1/explain.html) statement would generate event log entries for schema changes that were not executed.  [#120563][#120563]
