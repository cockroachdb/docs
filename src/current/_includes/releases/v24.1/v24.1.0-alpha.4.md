Release Date: March 25, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- When [configuring logs](../v24.1/configure-logs.html#output-to-files), `file-permissions` are now applied literally, such that `file-permissions: 644` will result in files with permissions matching `644` (instead of the previous behavior's `640`). Previously, CockroachDB's `umask` (which is always at least `007`) was being applied after the `file-permissions` field was used to create files, meaning the resulting permissions did not match those specified in the log configuration. [#120669][#120669]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The following [metrics](../v24.1/metrics.html) were added for observability of per-store disk events:
	- `storage.disk.read.count`
	- `storage.disk.read.bytes`
	- `storage.disk.read.time`
	- `storage.disk.write.count`
	- `storage.disk.write.bytes`
	- `storage.disk.write.time`
	- `storage.disk.io.time`
	- `storage.disk.weightedio.time`
	- `storage.disk.iopsinprogress`

	The metrics match the definitions of the `sys.host.disk.*` system metrics. [#119885][#119885]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- `server.controller.default_target_cluster` can now be set to any virtual cluster name by default, including a virtual cluster yet to be created or have service started. [#120080][#120080]
- The [`READ COMMITTED`](../v24.1/read-committed.html) isolation level now requires the cluster to have a valid enterprise license. [#120154][#120154]
- The new boolean changefeed option [`ignore_disable_changefeed_replication`](../v24.1/create-changefeed.html#ignore-disable-changefeed-replication), when set to `true`, prevents the changefeed from filtering events even if CDC filtering is configured via the `disable_changefeed_replication` [session variable](../v24.1/session-variables.html), `sql.ttl.changefeed_replication.disabled` [cluster setting](../v24.1/cluster-settings.html), or the `ttl_disable_changefeed_replication` [table storage parameter](../v24.1/alter-table.html#table-storage-parameters). [#120255][#120255]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added support for the [PL/pgSQL](../v24.1/plpgsql.html) `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` statements. [#119647][#119647]
- [Identity columns](../v24.1/create-table.html#identity-columns) now support enhanced sequence management through the [`ALTER [COLUMN] column_name SET sequence_option`](../v24.1/alter-table.html#alter-column) and [`ALTER [COLUMN] column_name RESTART [WITH restart]`](../v24.1/alter-table.html#alter-column) commands. This update facilitates the fine-tuning of identity column sequences. [#119432][#119432]
- It is now possible to use the `STRICT` option with [`SELECT ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) and [`RETURNING ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) in order to enforce that a SQL statement within a [PL/pgSQL](../v24.1/plpgsql.html) routine returns exactly one row. [#120486][#120486]
- Added a [session setting](../v24.1/session-variables.html) `plpgsql_use_strict_into`, which causes PL/pgSQL [`SELECT ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) and [`RETURNING ... INTO`](../v24.1/plpgsql.html#assign-a-result-to-a-variable) to require exactly one row from the SQL statement, similar to Oracle behavior. [#120486][#120486]
- Added a new `failure_count INT NOT NULL` column to `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics`. It represents the number of recorded statement execution failures for the given statement, as a new component of the overall statistics. [#120236][#120236]
- The `FORCE_INVERTED_INDEX` hint causes the [optimizer](../v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) to prefer a query plan scan over any inverted index of the hinted table. An error is emitted if no such query plan can be generated. [#120384][#120384]
- The `REPAIRCLUSTERMETADATA` privilege has been aliased to  `REPAIRCLUSTER`. Both names can be used interchangeably. [#116844][#116844]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The new [`cockroach start`](../v24.1/cockroach-start.html) option [`--wal-failover=among-stores` or `COCKROACH_WAL_FAILOVER=among-stores`]({% link v24.1/cockroach-start.md %}#write-ahead-log-wal-failover) environment variable will configure a multi-store CockroachDB node to fail over a store's write-ahead log (WAL) to another store's data directory. Failing over the write-ahead log may allow some operations against a store to continue completing, even if the underlying storage is temporarily unavailable. This feature is in [preview]({% link v24.1/cockroachdb-feature-availability.md %}#features-in-preview). [#120509][#120509]
- The new `storage.wal_failover.unhealthy_op_threshold` [cluster setting](../v24.1/cluster-settings.html) allows configuring the latency threshold at which a WAL write is considered unhealthy. [#120509][#120509]
- Two new metrics track the status of the SQL Activity Update job, which pre-aggregates top K information within the SQL statistics subsytem and writes the results to `system.statement_activity` and `system.transaction_activity`:
	- `sql.stats.activity.updates.successful`: Number of successful updates made by the SQL activity updater job.
	- `sql.stats.activity.update.latency`: The latency of updates made by the SQL activity updater job. Includes failed update attempts. [#120522][#120522]
- Added a new counter metric, `sql.stats.flush.done_signals.ignored`, that tracks the number of times the SQL activity update job has ignored the signal that indicates that a flush has completed. This metric may indicate that the SQL activity update job is taking longer than expected to complete. [#120522][#120522]
- Added a new counter metric, `sql.stats.activity.updates.failed`, to measure the number of update attempts made by the SQL activity update job that failed with errors. [#120522][#120522]
- Added a new counter metric, `sql.stats.flush.fingerprint.count`, that tracks the number of unique statement and transaction fingerprints included in the SQL stats flush. [#120522][#120522]
- The `/_status/stores` endpoint now includes `node_id`, `dir`, and `wal_failover_path` fields to show the store's node ID, data directory, and path to the configured WAL failover secondary, if configured. [#120677][#120677]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The new `--go-gc-percent` flag of the [`cockroach start`](../v24.1/cockroach-start.html) command controls the garbage collection target percentage of the Go runtime, mirroring the existing `GOGC` environment variable. A garbage collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage. If left unspecified and if a Go soft memory limit is configured (i.e., not explicitly disabled via `--max-go-memory` or `GOMEMLIMIT`), the garbage collection target percentage defaults to 300%. Setting the flag to a negative value disables the target percentage garbage collection heuristic, and only the soft memory limit heuristic triggers garbage collection. To monitor the impact of this change in the DB Console, look for an increase in **Memory usage** in the [Hardware dashboard]({% link v24.1/ui-hardware-dashboard.md %}#memory-usage) and an increase in **Go total memory usage** in the [Runtime dashboard]({% link v24.1/ui-runtime-dashboard.md %}#memory-usage). This does not increase the risk of an out-of-memory exception (OOM), because the Go memory limit (controlled by the `--max-go-memory` flag or the `GOMEMLIMIT` environment variable) prevents Go from consuming too much memory. [#119605][#119605]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**Queues** dashboard](../v24.1/ui-queues-dashboard.html) now includes lease queue metrics. [#119386][#119386]
- The DB Console **SQL Activity** [**Statement Fingerprint**](../v24.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprint-page) page has replaced the **Failed?** boolean column with a **Failure Count** column that shows the number of failed executions for the given statement fingerprint.<br /> In the **SQL Activity** table, the same statement fingeprint no longer appears in separate rows for failed executions and successful executions. Instead, they are combined into a single statement fingerprint. [#120236][#120236]
- The DB Console now displays an alert message when a license has expired or will expire in fewer than 15 days. [#120490][#120490]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug with [`DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`](../v24.1/drop-schema.html) that could lead to dangling function references in other schemas accessing any functions. [#119932][#119932]
- Fixed a bug where a [`RESTORE`](../v24.1/restore.html) of a backup that itself contained a table created by the `RESTORE` of a table with an in-progress [`IMPORT INTO`](../v24.1/import-into.html) would fail to restore all rows. [#120414][#120414]
- Fixed a bug where [identity columns](../v24.1/create-table.html#identity-columns) without any configured sequence options did not display the default values for identity attributes in `information_schema`. [#119459][#119459]
- Fixed a bug where a [`GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES`](../v24.1/grant.html) statement could fail if sequences existed and they did not support a privilege (e.g., `BACKUP`). [#120685][#120685]
- Fixed a bug where an [`EXPLAIN (DDL)`](../v24.1/explain.html) statement would generate event log entries for schema changes that were not executed.  [#120563][#120563]
