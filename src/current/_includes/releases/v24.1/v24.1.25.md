<h3 id="v24-1-25-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an `INSERT` statement could fail with a type checking error while adding a `BIT(n)` column. [#153606][#153606]
- A bug has been fixed that caused panics when
  executing `COPY` into a table with hidden columns and expression
  indexes. The panic only occurred when the
  `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` setting was enabled.
  This bug has been present since
  `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` was introduced in
  v22.1.0. [#154282][#154282]

<h3 id="v24-1-25-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- fixes a bug where the presence of duplicate temporary
  tables in a backup caused the restore to fail with an error containing
  the text 'restoring table desc and namespace
  entries: table already exists'.
