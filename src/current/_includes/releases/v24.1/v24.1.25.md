<h3 id="v24-1-25-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an `INSERT` statement could fail with a type checking error while adding a `BIT(n)` column. [#153606][#153606]
- Fixed a bug that caused panics when executing `COPY` into a table with hidden columns and expression indexes. The panic only occurred when the session setting `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` was enabled. This bug was introduced with `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` in v22.1.0. [#154282][#154282]
- Fixed a bug where the presence of duplicate temporary tables in a backup caused the restore to fail with an error containing the text `restoring table desc and namespace entries: table already exists`. [#154400][#154400]
