<h3 id="v24-1-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added a new Kafka [changefeed sink](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md) that uses the [`franz-go` library](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) and CockroachDB's `batching_sink` implementation. The new Kafka sink can be enabled with the `changefeed.new_kafka_sink_enabled` [cluster setting](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md), which is disabled by default. [#128018][#128018]
- The new Kafka sink, enabled with [`changefeed.new_kafka_sink_enabled`](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md), as well as the Google Cloud Pub/Sub sink, now display notices indicating the topics that a changefeed will emit to. [#128333][#128333]

<h3 id="v24-1-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a new `sql.auth.grant_option_for_owner.enabled` [cluster setting](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md) to prevent the [`GRANT OPTION`](/docs/v24.1/show-grants.md#privilege-grants) from being given to the owner of an object by default. The cluster setting defaults to `true`, retaining the existing behavior; when it is set to `false`, the `GRANT OPTION` is not implicitly given to an object's owner. The owner will still have all privileges on an object except the ability to grant privileges to other users. [#126959][#126959]

<h3 id="v24-1-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- A `--locality-file` flag is now available on the [`cockroach start`](/docs/v24.1/cockroach-start.md) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](/docs/v24.1/cockroach-start-single-node.md) commands. This allows specifying node [locality](/docs/v24.1/cockroach-start.md#locality) (typically a `region` value) as a file, rather than by using the [`--locality` flag](/docs/v24.1/cockroach-start.md#locality). [#127475][#127475]

<h3 id="v24-1-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**Databases** and **Tables** pages](/docs/v24.1/ui-databases-page.md) in the DB Console now show a loading state while loading information for databases and tables, including size and range counts. [#127748][#127748]
- On the [**Databases** page](/docs/v24.1/ui-databases-page.md) in the DB Console, table names will no longer appear with quotes around the schema and table name. [#127766][#127766]

<h3 id="v24-1-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2.0 in which CockroachDB would hit an internal error when evaluating [`INSERT`s](/docs/v24.1/insert.md) into [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](/docs/v24.1/alter-table.md#set-the-table-locality-to-regional-by-row) tables where the source was a [`VALUES`](/docs/v24.1/selection-queries.md#values-clause) clause with a single row and at least one Boolean expression. [#127277][#127277]
- Fixed a bug in which the [`DISCARD`](/docs/v24.1/alter-table.md) statement was disallowed when the [session setting](/docs/v24.1/session-variables.md#default-transaction-read-only) `default_transaction_read_only` was set to `on`. [#127363][#127363]
- In the [DB Console event log](/docs/v24.1/ui-overview-dashboard.md#events-panel), [`ALTER ROLE`](/docs/v24.1/alter-role.md) events now display correctly even when no [role options](/docs/v24.1/alter-role.md#role-options) are included in the `ALTER ROLE` statement. [#126568][#126568]
- Fixed a formatting issue with the `sql_sequence_cached_node` value of the [`serial_normalization` session setting](/docs/v24.1/session-variables.md). This could lead to an error connecting to CockroachDB if this value was set as the default for `serial_normalization` via the cluster setting [`sql.defaults.serial_normalization`](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-sql-defaults-serial-normalization). [#127673][#127673]
- Fixed a bug where [dropping `ENUM` values](/docs/v24.1/alter-type.md#drop-a-value-in-a-user-defined-type) that were referenced by [index expressions](/docs/v24.1/expression-indexes.md) could fail with an error. [#127454][#127454]
- Fixed a bug that caused a memory leak when executing SQL statements with [comments](/docs/v24.1/comment-on.md), for example, `SELECT /* comment */ 1;`. Memory owned by a SQL session would continue to grow as these types of statements were executed. The memory would only be released when closing the [SQL session](/docs/v24.1/show-sessions.md). This bug had been present since v23.1. [#127759][#127759]
- Fixed a bug where [schema changes](/docs/v24.1/online-schema-changes.md) could hang if the lease rangefeed stopped receiving updates. [#127487][#127487]
- Fixed small memory leaks that would occur during [changefeed](/docs/v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md) creation. [#128018][#128018]
- Fixed a memory leak that could occur when specifying a non-existent [virtual cluster](/docs/v24.1/cluster-virtualization-overview.md) name in the connection string. [#128106][#128106]
- Fixed a bug where [`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`](/docs/v24.1/create-index.md) would not correctly short-circuit if the given index already existed. [#128311][#128311]
- Fixed a bug in syntax validation, in which the `DESCENDING` clause was not allowed for non-terminal columns of an [inverted index](/docs/v24.1/inverted-indexes.md). Only the last column of an inverted index should be prevented from being `DESCENDING`. This is now properly checked. [#128311][#128311]
- Fixed a bug where an [index](/docs/v24.1/indexes.md) could store a column in the primary index if that column had a mixed-case name.  [#128311][#128311]
- Setting or dropping a default value on a [computed column](/docs/v24.1/computed-columns.md) is now blocked, even for `NULL` defaults. Previously, setting or dropping a default value on a computed column was a no-op. [#128466][#128466]
- Fixed a bug that could cause spurious user permission errors when multiple databases shared a common schema with a routine referencing a table. The bug had existed since v22.2 when [user-defined functions (UDFs)](/docs/v24.1/user-defined-functions.md) were introduced. [#126412][#126412]
- Fixed a bug where [`debug zip`](/docs/v24.1/cockroach-debug-zip.md) would return an error while fetching unstructured/malformed logs. [#128605][#128605]
- Fixed a bug where a hash-sharded [constraint](/docs/v24.1/constraints.md) could not be created if it referred to columns that had a backslash in the name. [#128521][#128521]
- Fixed a bug in which the output of [`EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT)`](/docs/v24.1/explain.md) for various `CREATE` statements was not redacted. This bug had existed since [`EXPLAIN (REDACT)`](/docs/v24.1/explain.md#parameters) was introduced in v23.1 and affects the following statements:
  - `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT) CREATE TABLE`
  - `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT) CREATE VIEW`
  - `EXPLAIN (OPT, REDACT) CREATE FUNCTION` [#128489][#128489]
