<h3 id="v24-1-12-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The cluster setting server.jwt_authentication.issuers now takes the issuers configuration value apart from the URI. This can be set to one of the following values: 1. Simple string that Go can parse as a valid issuer URL. 2. String that can be parsed as valid JSON array of issuer URLs list. 3. String that can be parsed as valid JSON and deserialized into a map of issuer URLs to corresponding JWKS URIs. In the third case we will be overriding the JWKS URI present in the issuer's well-known endpoint. Example valid values: - 'https://accounts.google.com' - ['example.com/adfs','https://accounts.google.com'] - '{    "issuer_jwks_map": {        "https://accounts.google.com": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs",        "example.com/adfs": "https://example.com/adfs/discovery/keys"     }    }' When `issuer_jwks_map` is set, we directly use the JWKS URI to get the key set. In all other cases where JWKSAutoFetchEnabled is set we obtain the JWKS URI first from issuer's well-known endpoint and then use this endpoint. [#138155][#138155]

<h3 id="v24-1-12-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The pts records of running feeds are now updated when the set of targets changes, such as when system tables are added to the protected tables list. [#138668][#138668]

<h3 id="v24-1-12-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting has been added, which reverts the changes of #133037 that cause the change in typing behavior described in #137837. Specifically, it makes type-checking and overload resolution ignore the newly added "unpreferred" overloads. This setting defaults to `on`. [#138000][#138000]
- Since v23.2 table statistics histograms have been collected for non-indexed JSON columns. Histograms are no longer collected for these columns if `sql.stats.non_indexed_json_histograms.enabled` is set to `false`. This reduces memory usage during table statistics collection, for both automatic and manual collection via `ANALYZE` and `CREATE STATISTICS`. [#140268][#140268]
- Added support for a new index hint, AVOID_FULL_SCAN, which will prevent the optimizer from planning a full scan for the specified table if any other plan is possible. The hint can be used in the same way as other existing index hints. For example, SELECT * FROM table_name@{AVOID_FULL_SCAN};. This hint is similar to NO_FULL_SCAN, but will not error if a full scan cannot be avoided. Note that normally a full scan of a partial index would not be considered a "full scan" for the purposes of the NO_FULL_SCAN and AVOID_FULL_SCAN hints, but if the user has explicitly forced the partial index via FORCE_INDEX=index_name, we do consider it a full scan. [#140272][#140272]
- The `optimizer_prefer_bounded_cardinality` session setting has been added which instructs the optimizer to prefer query plans where every expression has a guaranteed upper-bound on the number of rows it will process. This may help the optimizer produce better query plans in some cases. This setting is disabled by default. [#140272][#140272]
- The `optimizer_min_row_count` session setting has been added which sets a lower bound on row count estimates for relational expressions during query planning. A value of zero, which is the default, indicates no lower bound. Note that if this is set to a value greater than zero, a row count of zero can still be estimated for expressions with a cardinality of zero, e.g., for a contradictory filter. Setting this to a value higher than 0, such as 1, may yield better query plans in some cases, such as when statistics are frequently stale and inaccurate. [#140272][#140272]

<h3 id="v24-1-12-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- New metrics which expose the ttl for various certificates [#138659][#138659]
- This patch introduces a metric, `sql.schema_changer.object_count`, that keeps track of the count of objects in the cluster. [#138839][#138839]

<h3 id="v24-1-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- `ALTER BACKUP SCHEDULE` no longer fails on schedules whose collection URI contains a space. [#138080][#138080]
- Previously `SHOW CREATE TABLE` was showing incorrect data with regards to inverted indexes.  It now shows the correct data that can be repeatedly entered back into crdb to recreate the same table. [#138168][#138168]
- Fixed a bug where querying the `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` table while the schema changer was dropping a constraint could result in a query error. [#138285][#138285]
- Fixed a timing issue between `ALTER VIEW .. RENAME` and `DROP VIEW` that caused repeated failures in the `DROP VIEW` job. [#137887][#137887]
- Queries that perform a cast from the string representation of an array containing geometry or geography types to a SQL array type will now succeed. [#138693][#138693]
- Security.certificate.* metrics will now be updated if a node loads new certificates while running. [#138659][#138659]
- When we set `allow_role_memberships_to_change_during_transaction` are able to create and drop users quickly even when there are contending transactions on the `system.users` and `system.role_options`. [#139027][#139027]
- Fixed a bug where the error "batch timestamp T must be after replica GC threshold" could occur during a schema change backfill operation, and cause the schema change job to retry infinitely. Now this error is treated as permanent, and will cause the job to enter the failed state. [#139248][#139248]
- CockroachDB could previously hit a bounded memory leak when collecting table statistics on a table that had both very wide (10KiB or more) and relatively small (under 400B) `BYTES`-like values within the same row. This has been present since before 19.2 version. Additionally, in 24.1.0 a bug was introduced that made this leak also apply to `STRING`-like values. [#139174][#139174]
