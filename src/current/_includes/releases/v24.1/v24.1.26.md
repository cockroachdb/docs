<h3 id="v24-1-26-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare race condition between range splits and MVCC garbage collection where a GCRequest could target keys outside its declared span. In rare cases, this could result in data on the post-split right-hand side (RHS) being incorrectly garbage collected, potentially leading to lost writes. The system now detects and rejects such malformed GC requests. [#163777][#163777]
- Fixed a bug where generating a debug zip could trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition on a node if malformed log entries were present in logs using json or json-compact formatting. Debug zip generation now safely handles malformed log lines and prevents excessive memory consumption. [#163799][#163799]
