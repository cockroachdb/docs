## v24.1.0-alpha.1

Release Date: March 7, 2024

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- AS OF SYSTEM TIME queries can no longer use a timestamp followed by a question mark to signifiy a future-time value. This was an undocumented syntax. [#116830][#116830]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Versions during upgrades are renamed, for example `23.2-8` is now `23.2-upgrading-to-24.1-step-008`. [#115223][#115223]
- Remove the /debug/events endpoint which is no longer populated. [#117936][#117936]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- `ALTER CHANGEFEED` no longer removes CDC query when modifying changefeed properties. [#116498][#116498]
- `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable` is now deprecated. Users should use a new cluster setting `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy` instead. `changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy='balanced_simple'` has the same effect as setting `changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable=true`. It does not require `initial_scan='only'`, which was required by the old setting. [#115166][#115166]
- Fix CDC query to correctly handle `changefeed_creation_time()` function. [#117520][#117520]
- The new 'WITH PRIOR REPLICATION DETAILS' option can now be passed when inspecting a virtual cluster with SHOW VIRTUAL CLUSTER to request additional details about where the virtual cluster was replicated _from_ and when it was activated, if that virtual cluster was created via replication.  Epic: CRDB-34233. [#117636][#117636]
- A virtual cluster which was previously being used as the source for physical cluster replication into a standby in another cluster which has since been activated can now be reconfigured to become a standby of that now-promoted cluster, reversing the direction of the replication stream, and does so by reusing the existing data as much as possible.  Epic: CRDB-34233. [#117656][#117656]
- BACKUPs now load range information as they need it to avoid a spike in metadata lookups when backups begin. Epic: none. [#116520][#116520]
- Clusters created to run PCR no longer automatically disable the spanconfig.range_coalescing settings. Users who started using PCR on 23.1 or 23.2 may wish to manually reset these settings.  Epic: none. [#119221][#119221]
- Physical Cluster Replication is now always enabled, and the setting physical_replication.enabled has been removed. [#119149][#119149]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- ALTER BACKUP SCHEDULE ... EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY can now be used set the next scheduled execution of the schedule to the current time. Epic: none. [#112118][#112118]
- Fix the SQL activity update job to avoid conflicts on update, reduces the amount of data cached to just what the overview page requires, and fix the correctess of the top queries. [#112350][#112350]
- `pg_catalog`'s `pg_class` and `pg_attribute` tables now have context of user-defined composite types (in accordance with PostgreSQL's corresponding `pg_catalog` tables). In addition, the `typrelid` column in the `pg_type` table has the proper oid for composite types. [#111179][#111179]
- The newly added builtin `jsonb_array_to_string_array` no longer removes NULL objects and includes them into the resulting array. [#112975][#112975]
- Currently, RUs are showing integer number. RUs have the potensial to be floating number, however they are now rounded. From now on, RUs are showing floating number, so they are not rounded. [#111986][#111986]
- The `information_schema._pg_char_octet_length` builtin function is now supported, which improves compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#111401][#111401]
- The `pg_encoding_max_length` builtin function is now supported, which improves compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#111401][#111401]
- The `information_schema._pg_datetime_precision` builtin function is now supported, which improves compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#111401][#111401]
- The `information_schema._pg_interval_type` builtin function is now supported, which improves compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#111401][#111401]
- This patch populates information_schema.user_defined_types with information about user defined types and information_schema.attributes with information about the attributes of composite data types. [#111401][#111401]
- The optimizer will no longer generate a constrained scan that only uses filters from a check constraint. This prevents cases where a constrained scan actually scans the entire table because the constraints aren't selective. [#114332][#114332]
- Reads rolled back by savepoints are now refreshable, matching the Postgres behavior and avoiding potential serializability violations. [#111424][#111424]
- Implement the postgis ST_TileEnvelope function [#112971][#112971]
- Added support for third argument in the array_position() builtin. If provided, it gives the index from which to begin searching in the array. [#112161][#112161]
- Added the bit_count builtin function for BIT and BYTEA types. [#115273][#115273]
- A pg_backend_pid column was added to crdb_internal.node_sessions and crdb_internal.cluster_sessions. This value corresponds to the numerical ID returned from pg_backend_pid(). [#116673][#116673]
- Reject changing column types unless an explicitly cast is provided where cannot automatically cast. This replicates logic in postgres. Prior to this change, casts such as BOOL to INT were possible without explicitly casting. [#115442][#115442]
- A new session setting, `optimizer_merge_joins_enabled`, has been added that, when true, instructs the optimizer to explore query plans with merge joins. The setting defaults to true. [#116410][#116410]
- CockroachDB now supports parsing queries like `SELECT FROM t` that only produce the row count and do not output any columns. [#116835][#116835]
- Metaphone() builtin function was added. [#110950][#110950]
- This patch adds the new EXPIRATION WINDOW option set through `ALTER TENANT appTenant SET REPLICATION EXPIRATION WINDOW ='100ms'`, which allows the user to override the default producer job expiration window of 24 hours. The producer job expiration window determines how long the producer job stays alive without a heartbeat from the consumer job. [#117776][#117776]
- SELECT FOR SHARE SKIP LOCKED, which was previously disallowed, no works. [#117560][#117560]
- Add configurable settings for total TCP keep alive probes (server.sql_tcp_keep_alive.count) and TCP probe intervals (server.sql_tcp_keep_alive.interval) for SQL connections. Removes the COCKROACH_SQL_TCP_KEEP_ALIVE environment variable subsuming it. [#115833][#115833]
- Remove sql.trace.session_eventlog.enabled and the associated event log tracing. The information in these traces is still available in the DEV log channel by enabling --vmodule=conn_executor=2. [#117928][#117928]
- `array_agg` aggregate function can now support arrays as the input. Note, however, that CockroachDB still doesn't have full support of nested arrays (that is tracked by #32552), and `array_agg` doesn't support nested arrays as inputs either. [#117838][#117838]
- Additional execution statistic that measures "client time" is now included into `plan.txt` files of the stmt bundles. This client time tracks how long the query execution was blocked on the client receiving the PGWire protocol messages. Note that in EXPLAIN ANALYZE context it doesn't make much sense because in that variant the output rows are discarded and are not communicated to the client. [#117591][#117591]
- Add column `trace_id` to the response of the `SHOW SESSIONS` command. [#118002][#118002]
- New field `SkippedTransactions` in the SampledTransaction event, which is emitted to the TELEMETRY logging channel when telemetry logging is enabled and set to "transaction" mode. [#115722][#115722]
- Added support for the ENCODING option of COPY, as long as the encoding of 'UTF8' is specified. [#118010][#118010]
- Add the SHOW VARIABLES FOR ROLE command which allows the database administrator to easily view the default values for a session variables applied to a given user. [#117875][#117875]
- The sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled cluster setting is now true by default. This means that any syntax and settings that configure the READ COMMITTED isolation level will now cause the transaction to use that isolation level, rather than automatically upgrading the transaction to SERIALIZABLE. [#118479][#118479]
- Add a new cluster setting, `sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled`, which when set enables collection of table statistics on virtual computed columns. [#118241][#118241]
- Added the autocommit_before_ddl session variable. When set to true, any schema change statement that is sent during an explicit transaction will cause the transaction to commit before executing the schema change. [#118440][#118440]
- CREATE SEQUENCE is now enabled by default in the declarative schema changer. [#117793][#117793]
- PL/pgSQL now supports nested blocks, with the following limitations for now: variable shadowing is disallowed, and exception handlers cannot be used in a routine with nested blocks. [#117710][#117710]
- Make the cluster setting `sql.index_recommendation.drop_unused_duration` public for docs. [#118676][#118676]
- It is now possible to hint to the optimizer that it should plan a straight join by using the syntax `... INNER STRAIGHT JOIN ...`. If the hint is provided, the optimizer will now fix the join order as given in the query, even if it estimates that a different plan using join reordering would have a lower cost. [#116013][#116013]
- Add column `goroutine_id` to the response of the `SHOW SESSIONS` command. [#118644][#118644]
- Introduced a new setting, `close_cursors_at_commit`, which causes a cursor to remain open even after its calling transaction commits. Note that transaction rollback still closes any cursor created in that transaction. [#117910][#117910]
- Added the server.max_open_transactions_per_gateway cluster setting. When set to a non-negative value, then non-admin users cannot execute a query if the number of transactions open on the current gateway node is already at the configured limit. [#118781][#118781]
- Added the setseed() builtin function. It sets the seed for the random generator used by the random() builtin function. [#119042][#119042]
- OUT and INOUT parameter classes are now supported in User-Defined Functions. [#118610][#118610]
- Out-of-process SQL servers will start exporting a new sql.aggregated_livebytes metric. This metric gets updated once every 60 seconds by default, and its update interval can be configured via the `tenant_global_metrics_exporter_interval` cluster setting. [#119140][#119140]
- Added support for index hints with INSERT and UPSERT statements. This allows INSERT ... ON CONFLICT and UPSERT queries to use index hints in the same way they are already supported for UPDATE and DELETE statements. [#119104][#119104]
- A new `ttl_disable_changefeed_replication` table storage parameter has been added and can be used to disable changefeed replication for row-level TTL on a per-table basis. [#119611][#119611]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The following 2 cluster settings are marked as public and should be documented: - sql.telemetry.query_sampling.mode - sql.telemetry.txn_mode.tracking_limit [#114186][#114186]
- Updates the error message in case of stalled disks to use the appropriate term for that event ("disk stall"), which is also what metrics/dashboards refer to that event as. [#114746][#114746]
- This change introduces the `changefeed.emitted_batch_sizes` histogram metric which measures the batch sizes used when emitting data to sinks. This metric supports metrics labels.  Closes: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/114141 [#115537][#115537]
- The cluster setting sql.contention.record_serialization_conflicts.enabled is now on by default. This means any 40001 errors that are returned containing conflicting transaction information will be recorded by the contention registry.  Closes: #114416 [#116664][#116664]
- The setting `kv.rangefeed.scheduler.enabled` has been removed, as the rangefeed scheduler is now unconditionally enabled. [#114410][#114410]
- The setting `kv.rangefeed.catchup_scan_concurrency` has been removed. Catchup scans are throttled via `kv.rangefeed.concurrent_catchup_iterators` on a per-node basis. [#114408][#114408]
- The cluster setting `changefeed.mux_rangefeed.enabled` has been removed, and is in effect always enabled. [#114408][#114408]
- The gossip status advanced debug page now includes information about the server's high water stamps for every other node it knows about in the gossip cluster. [#117011][#117011]
- COCKROACH_RANGEFEED_RPC_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE env variable has been removed, and rangefeed connection now uses the same window size as other RPC connections. [#117545][#117545]
- New cluster settings:  - sql.telemetry.transaction_sampling.statement_events_per_transaction.max: controls the maximum number of statement events to emit per sampled transaction for TELEMETRY - sql.telemetry.transaction_sampling.frequency: controls the maximum frequency at which we sample transactions for telemetry [#115733][#115733]
- Events for cluster setting changes are now emitted to the OPS channel rather than the DEV channel. [#117923][#117923]
- The new environment variable, COCKROACH_RPC_USE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_CLASS, instructs CRDB to send most network/RPC workloads, except the system traffic, through a single "default" RPC/TCP connection. This is a safety mechanism, it reverts to pre-v24.1 behaviour in case the environment does not tolerate multiple TCP connections. The default behaviour in v24.1+ is having multiple connections dedicated to different types of traffic, such as raft and rangefeeds. [#117810][#117810]
- Transactions sampled for the telemetry logging channel will now emit a SampledTransaction event. To sample transactions, set the cluster setting `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.mode = 'transaction'` and enable telemetry logging via `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.enabled = true`. [#115722][#115722]
- In (unredacted) debug zips, the crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events table file has 2 new columns: - waiting_stmt_query: query of the waiting stmt - blocking_txn_queries_unordered: unordered list of the blocking txn's queries [#118478][#118478]
- Transaction replay protection state is now passed between the outgoing and incoming leaseholder for a range during a lease transfer. This avoids cases where lease transfers can cause transactions to throw TransactionAbortedError(ABORT_REASON_NEW_LEASE_PREVENTS_TXN) errors. [#118300][#118300]
- CRDB will now automatically generate CPU profiles if there is an increase in CPU utilization. This can help investigate possible issues after the fact. [#118850][#118850]
- Expanded --include-range-info flag to additionally include problem ranges. This is still defaulted to true. [#119205][#119205]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-cluster-virtualization">Cluster virtualization</h3>

- Added a new 'flashback' command to revert a virtual cluster to an earlier state using ALTER VIRTUAL CLUSTER RESET DATA.  Epic: CRDB-34233. [#117429][#117429]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Debug zip's no longer include redundant hex_ columns for system table BYTES columns. [#112033][#112033]
- Add --follower-read-percent to the workload kv run. [#113094][#113094]
- Workload schemachange now writes a .otlp.ndjson.gz archive containing OTLP trace bundles for debugging purposes. [#114770][#114770]
- Cockroach debug tsdump creates tsdump.yaml  1. tsdump raw format automatically creates yaml file in default location `/tmp/tsdump.yaml`  2. new flag: `--yaml`. Allows users to specify path to create `tsdump.yaml` instead of default location  Usage:  cockroach debug tsdump --host <host>:<port> \ --format raw --yaml=/some_path/tsdump.yaml > /some_path/tsdump.gob  Authored by: Daniel Almeida  Epic: none [#114046][#114046]
- Removal of the `cockroach connect` functionality. [#113893][#113893]
- Change the SQL shell help URL to point to cockroach-sql.html. [#118960][#118960]
- A new encode-uri utility has been added to make generating connection strings for use with physical replication easier. [#119528][#119528]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Store initialization now logs progress every 10 seconds. [#115760][#115760]
- Introduce a new lease preferences graph on the replication dashboard. The lease preferences graph will display when the current leaseholder is not the first lease preference and where the current leaseholder satisfies no applied lease preference. [#116709][#116709]
- Statement bundles are now enabled for tenant clusters. [#117357][#117357]
- Properly remove warning of old date on Active Executions when auto refresh is enabled. [#118675][#118675]
- On Statement Details page always show the entire selected period, instead of just the period that had data. [#118680][#118680]
- The error messages surfaced in DB Console now include information about the HTTP response status code, if one is present. [#118782][#118782]
- The `Full Table/Index Scans` chart in the sql metrics dashboard now shows the non-negative derivative of the number of full scans tracked. [#118787][#118787]
- The Overload Dashboard page now includes two additional graphs: - Elastic CPU Utilization - This is used the show the CPU utilization by   elastic work, compared to the limit set for elastic work. - Elastic CPU Exhausted Duration Per Second - This is used to show the   duration of CPU exhaustion by elastic work, in microseconds. [#118763][#118763]
- The "Write Too Old" metric in the "Transaction Restarts" graph under the SQL Dashboard now includes all restarts previously categorized as "Write Too Old (multiple)". The former is a now a superset of the latter. The "Write Too Old (multiple)" metric will be removed in a future release. [#119411][#119411]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that has existed since before v22.2 which could cause an internal error during distributed execution for an expression like `CASE` that requires its inputs to be the same type with all `NULL` inputs. [#108892][#108892]
- Fixes null input handling for the geospatial built-ins st_pointfromgeohash and st_geomfromgeohash. [#113781][#113781]
- The geospatial st_makeenvelope built-in now correctly supports xmin or ymin to be greater than xmax or ymax, respectively. [#113781][#113781]
- Fixed a bug that could cause 23.1 nodes in clusters which had not finalized the 23.1 version upgrade to use excessive CPU retrying expected errors related to the incomplete upgrade state. [#113864][#113864]
- Debug zip doesn't fail on corrupted log files. [#113722][#113722]
- Placeholder arguments can now be used in SET TRANSACTION statements. [#113689][#113689]
- Previously, when session variable `use_declarative_schema_changer=off`, ALTER PK would delete any comments associated with the old primary index and with the old primary key constraint. This is inconsistent with the behavior with when `use_declarative_schema_changer=on`, which is the default setting, where those comments would be carried over to the new primary index. Furthermore, the old behavior also caused a bug that could prevent command `SHOW CREATE t` from working (see #114081). [#114354][#114354]
- Previously, when set `use_declarative_schema_changer=off` and we attempt to alter primary key on a table that has unique secondary indexes on new-pk-cols, the unique secondary index would incorrectly still have old-pk-cols as its keySuffixColumn after the ALTER PK. This is problematic because a subsequent dropping of the old-pk-cols would unexpectedly drop those unique secondary indexes as well, even without CASCADE. This commit fixes that. [#114622][#114622]
- ALTER BACKUP SCHEDULE can be used to set updates_cluster_last_backup_time_metric without providing an explicit value, matching the behavior of the option when specified during CREATE SCHEDULE.  Epic: none. [#113523][#113523]
- Previously, if we have a table with secondary indexes that store some columns `col` via the `STORING` clause, and we alter primary key to `col` on this table, then we'd end up with incorrect secondary index where it continues to have the `STORING` clause, even though that column is already in the primary key and we don't allow creating a secondary index storing any primary key columns. This commit fixes that such that after the ALTER PK, the `STORING` clause is dropped on those secondary indexes. [#115214][#115214]
- Fixes a regression that causes uploads to object locked buckets to fail because of the absence of an MD5 hash [#115713][#115713]
- ALTER PRIMARY KEY now preserves the name of the original primary index when `use_declarative_schema_changer=off` [#115338][#115338]
- We fixed a bug where if we add a unique-without-index-not-valid constraint to a table, then the `create_statement` from `SHOW CREATE t` is not executable and errors with "unique constraint cannot be NOT VALID". The intention here is to disallow index-backed-unique constraint and this patch fixes that. [#115354][#115354]
- An empty full backup, followed by non-empty incrementals taken inside an application tenant may be unrestoreable because of the use of an incorrect SQL codec [#116316][#116316]
- Fixed a bug in the row-level TTL job that would cause it to skip expired rows if the primary key of the table included columns of the collated string or decimal type. [#116988][#116988]
- Incorrectly labeled PL/pgSQL blocks now return an expected syntax error. [#117608][#117608]
- CREATE EXTERNAL CONNECTION IF NOT EXISTS no longer returns an error if the connection already exists. [#117312][#117312]
- CockroachDB now correctly uses the histograms on columns of COLLATED STRING type. The bug has been present since pre-22.1 release. [#117714][#117714]
- Improved an interaction during range lease transfers which could previously cause `RETRY_ASYNC_WRITE_FAILURE` errors to be returned to clients. [#117840][#117840]
- Backfilling tables for CREATE TABLE AS or CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW could get into a retry loop if data was deleted and these jobs took longer than the GC TTL. [#117877][#117877]
- Decommissioning replicas which are part of a mis-replicated range will no longer get stuck on a rebalance operation that was falsely determined to be unsafe. This bug was introduced in 23.1.0. [#117900][#117900]
- A memory leak within the insights system was found to occur when `sql.metrics.transaction_details.enabled` was disabled, while leaving `sql.metrics.statement_details.enabled` enabled. This patch fixes the memory leak by preventing the collection of further statement & transaction insights when `sql.metrics.transaction_details.enabled` is disabled. [#117709][#117709]
- Fixed a rare panic that could happen during a pg_dump import that contains a function like `SELECT addgeometrycolumn(...)`. Now, attempting to import a pg_dump with a function that has a subquery in one of its arguments results in an expected error. [#118569][#118569]
- AUTO CREATE STATS jobs could previously lead to growth in an internal system table resulting in slower job-system related queries. [#118589][#118589]
- Cockroach will no longer spam the logs with "unable to get CPU capacity" errors every 10 seconds when running outside of a CPU cgroup. [#118657][#118657]
- A bug has been fixed where casts of floats to integers truncated the value. These casts now round a float to the nearest integer, rounding ties to even integers. [#117798][#117798]
- Fix a bug where stmts like `ADD COLUMN j INT, ADD UNIQUE WIHOUT INDEX (j)` would fail with an internal error. [#118291][#118291]
- Previously, altering from a Regional By Row table to a Regional By Table table could cause leaseholders to never move to the databse's primary region. This is now fixed. [#118001][#118001]
- Those with VIEWACTIVITY privilege can now request statement bundles using crdb_internal.requets_statement_bundle or via db-console's sql activity page. [#118760][#118760]
- This commit fixes an internal error with message like: "LeafTxn ... incompatible with locking request" that occurs when performing an update under read committed isolation which cascades to a table with multiple other foreign keys. [#118722][#118722]
- ALTER PRIMARY KEY could fail with a "non-nullable column <x> with no value! Index scanned .." when validating recreated secondary indexes. [#118843][#118843]
- Fixed a bug which caused an inscrutable error when a sequence name allocated by `SERIAL` conflicted with an existing type name. [#118861][#118861]
- Fixed a bug where COMMENT statements could fail with an "unexpected value" error if multiple COMMENT statements were running concurrently. [#119007][#119007]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an internal error "attempting to append refresh spans after the tracked timestamp has moved forward" in some cases when using virtual tables (like `crdb_internal.system_jobs`, etc), and this has now been fixed. The bug was introduced in 23.1 version. [#119176][#119176]
- Fixed a bug that caused the sql.txns.open.internal and sql.statements.active.internal metrics to never get updated. These metrics are gauges that count the number of transactions and statements being executed by operations internal to CockroachDB; they do not include any operations executed by the external SQL client. This bug was present since v22.1.0. [#119251][#119251]
- Crdb_internal.leases could cause a node to become unavailable due to a deadlock in the leasing subsystem. [#119305][#119305]
- If an individual replica's circuit breaker had tripped but the range was otherwise functional, e.g. because the replica was partially partitioned away from the leaseholder, it was possible for a gateway to persistently error when contacting this replica instead of retrying against a functional leaseholder elsewhere. The gateway will now retry such errors against other replicas once. [#118737][#118737]
- Fixes a bug in the webhook sink where the http request body may not be initialized on retries, resulting in the error "http: ContentLength=... with Body length 0". [#119326][#119326]
- Fixed a bug where rangefeed resolved timestamps could get stuck, continually emitting the log message "pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split", typically following a range merge. [#119512][#119512]
- Fixed a condition where some files were not closed  when inspecting backup metadata during BACKUP and RESTORE. Epic: none. [#119625][#119625]
- Fixed a bug where some backup metadata files opened during RESTORE were not closed. Epic: none. [#119625][#119625]
- A bug has been fixed that caused internal errors when executing EXPORT statement. [#119538][#119538]

<h3 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Sorting by locality can improve the performance and predictability of follower reads. [#112993][#112993]
- Allows stores to start in parallel reducing start times for nodes with many stores. [#115285][#115285]

- Rangefeeds, the infrastructure used for changefeeds, now use a more efficient engine that reduces the number of goroutines and the associated Go scheduler pressure and latency. [#114410][#114410]
- Rangefeeds, the infrastructure for changefeeds, now use a more efficient multiplexing protocol. [#114408][#114408]
- The optimizer now generates constrained scans on indexes containing boolean, computed expressions. [#114798][#114798]
- This change introduces a separate RPC connection class for most raft traffic. This improves isolation and reduces interference with the foreground SQL traffic, which reduces chances of head-of-line blocking caused by unrelated traffic under high load conditions. The new COCKROACH_RAFT_USE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_CLASS env variable can be set to use the default connection class instead (the previous behaviour). [#117385][#117385]
- This change separates the rangefeed traffic into its own RPC connection class. This improves isolation and reduces interference with the foreground SQL traffic, which reduces chances of head-of-line blocking caused by unrelated traffic. The new COCKROACH_RANGEFEED_USE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_CLASS env variable can be set to use the DefaultClass instead (which was the previous default choice for rangefeeds). [#117730][#117730]
- This change makes changefeed initial scan traffic, which can be bulky, go through a different RPC/TCP connection than the foreground SQL/KV traffic. This reduces interference between workloads, and reduces chances of head-of-line blocking issues. [#117810][#117810]
- The optimizer now generates more efficient query plans for queries with comparison of timestamp and interval columns, e.g., `timestamp_col - '1 day'::INTERVAL > now()`. [#118307][#118307]

- The --config-profile command line flag added for preview support of PCR in the previous release has been removed. Nodes, including those for clusters on which PCR may be used, are instead started normally, with the one-time steps to configure the cluster for PCR being performed via SQL statements instead. Specifically, to use PCR, on the source cluster one must 1) create an application tenant, 2) switch it to be the default, and 3) enable rangefeeds. [#119366][#119366]

- Cluster setting for changefeed.balance_range_distribution.enable now has a clearer description. [#114599][#114599]

<h4 id="v24-1-0-alpha-1-missing-category">Missing category</h4>

- `kafka_sink_config` now supports specifying a different client ID for different changefeeds, enabling users to define distinct kafka quota configurations for various changefeeds.  For any kafka versions >= V1_0_0_0 ([KIP-190: Handle client-ids consistently between clients and brokers](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-190%3A+Handle+client-ids+consistently+between+clients+and+brokers)), any string can be used as client ID. For earlier kafka versions, clientID can only contain characters [A-Za-z0-9._-] are acceptable.  For example, ``` CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR ... WITH kafka_sink_config='{"ClientID": "clientID1"}' ``` [#118643][#118643]
- Changefeed.kafka_throttling_hist_nanos has now been added to metrics to monitor sarama throttling behavior resulting from exceeding kafka quota. [#117693][#117693]
