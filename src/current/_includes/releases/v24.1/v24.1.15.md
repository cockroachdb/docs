<h3 id="v24-1-15-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the `sql.statement_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the statement timeout.
 [#142157][#142157]
- Added the `sql.transaction_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the transaction timeout.
 [#142157][#142157]
- The `node decommission` CLI command now waits until the target node is completely drained before marking it as fully decommissioned. Previously, the command would start draining but not wait, leaving the node in an unstable state where it could still accept client requests while being unable to communicate with the cluster, causing those requests to hang or hit unexpected errors.

<h3 id="v24-1-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause SHOW TABLES and
  other introspection operations to encounter a "batch timestamp
  must be after replica GC threshold" error. [#141723][#141723]
- Fixed a bug that could cause gateway nodes to panic when performing an `UPSERT` on a table with a `BOOL` primary key column and a partial index that used the primary key column as the predicate expression.
 [#141824][#141824]
- Fixed a bug where `CREATE SEQUENCE` without other concurrent DDL operations could hit a retry error because of the schema being incorrectly modified.
 [#142609][#142609]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate casts to some OID types (like `REGCLASS`) in some cases. The bug had been present since at least v22.1.
 [#141959][#141959]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `nil pointer dereference` errors when executing statements with user-defined functions (UDFs). The error could also occur when executing statements with some built-in functions, like `obj_description`.
 [#141651][#141651]
- Fixed a bug where a node that was drained as part of decommissioning may have interrupted SQL connections that were still active during drain (and for which drain would have been expected to wait).
 [#142816][#142816]
- Fixed a bug where the fraction completed and internal checkpoints during an index backfill operation would stop getting written if any of the periodic fraction/checkpoint write operations failed. Additional logging was added so that progress is logged in addition to being written to the job record. This bug affected schema change operations such as creating an index or adding a non-nullable column to a table.
 [#141786][#141786]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent `SHOW CREATE TABLE` from working if a database was offline (e.g., due to a `RESTORE` on that database).
 [#141510][#141510]
- Fixed a bug in which CockroachDB disregarded tuple labels in some cases. This could cause unexpected behavior, such as when converting a tuple to `JSON` with `to_jsonb`. The bug causing incorrect removal of tuple labels was introduced in v22.1.0, and changes in v24.1.7 made unexpected behavior due to the bug more likely.
 [#142137][#142137]
- Fixed a bug where the declarative schema changer allowed `CREATE SEQUENCE` operations to proceed even while a `DROP SCHEMA` or `DROP DATABASE` was in progress. Such operations now retry if the parent object has a schema change in progress, preventing new child objects from being created under deleted parent objects.
 [#142761][#142761]
- Fixed a bug in `v24.1.14`, `v24.3.7`, `v24.3.8`, and `v25.1` that could cause a nil-pointer error when a column's default expression contained a volatile expression (like `nextval`) as a UDF argument.
 [#143637][#143637]

<h3 id="v24-1-15-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- When configuring the `sql.ttl.default_delete_rate_limit` cluster setting, a notice is displayed informing the user that the TTL rate limit is per leaseholder per table with a link to the docs.
