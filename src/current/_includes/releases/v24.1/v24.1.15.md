## v24.1.15

Release Date: April 3, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

### Operational changes

- Added the `sql.statement_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the statement timeout. [#142157][#142157]
- Added the `sql.transaction_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the transaction timeout. [#142157][#142157]
- The `node decommission` CLI command now waits until the target node is fully drained before marking it as decommissioned. Previously, the command would start draining but not wait, leaving the node in an unstable state where it could still accept client requests while being unable to communicate with the cluster, causing those requests to hang or fail with unexpected errors. [#142427][#142427]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that could cause `SHOW TABLES` and other introspection operations to encounter a "batch timestamp must be after replica GC threshold" error. [#141723][#141723]
- Fixed a bug that could cause gateway nodes to panic when performing an `UPSERT` on a table with a `BOOL` primary key column and a partial index using the primary key column as the predicate expression. [#141824][#141824]
- Fixed a bug where `CREATE SEQUENCE` without concurrent DDL operations could hit a retry error due to incorrect schema modification. [#142609][#142609]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate casts to some OID types (e.g., `REGCLASS`). This issue had been present since v22.1 or earlier. [#141959][#141959]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `nil pointer dereference` errors when executing statements with user-defined functions (UDFs) or certain built-in functions like `obj_description`. [#141651][#141651]
- Fixed a bug where nodes drained during decommissioning could interrupt active SQL connections unexpectedly, even when drain was expected to wait for them to complete. [#142816][#142816]
- Fixed a bug where the fraction completed and internal checkpoints during an index backfill operation would stop being written if any periodic fraction/checkpoint write failed. Progress is now additionally logged to aid debugging. This bug affected schema changes such as creating an index or adding a non-nullable column. [#141786][#141786]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent `SHOW CREATE TABLE` from working if a database was offline (e.g., due to a `RESTORE`). [#141510][#141510]
- Fixed a bug where tuple labels were sometimes disregarded, causing unexpected behavior, such as when converting a tuple to `JSON` with `to_jsonb`. This bug existed since v22.1.0 and became more likely to cause issues after changes in v24.1.7. [#142137][#142137]
- Fixed a bug where the declarative schema changer allowed `CREATE SEQUENCE` operations to proceed even while a `DROP SCHEMA` or `DROP DATABASE` was in progress. Such operations now retry if the parent object has a schema change in progress. [#142761][#142761]
- Fixed a bug in `v24.1.14`, `v24.3.7`, `v24.3.8`, and `v25.1` that could cause a nil-pointer error when a column's default expression contained a volatile expression (like `nextval`) as a UDF argument. [#143637][#143637]

### Miscellaneous

- Configuring the `sql.ttl.default_delete_rate_limit` cluster setting now displays a notice clarifying that the TTL rate limit is per leaseholder per table, with a link to the documentation. [#142832][#142832]
