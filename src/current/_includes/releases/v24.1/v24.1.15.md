<h3 id="v24-1-15-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug existing only in pre-release versions
  of v25.1 which could cause unexpected errors during planning for `VALUES`
  expressions containing function calls with multiple overloads. [#140648][#140648]
- The `optimizer_check_input_min_row_count`
  session setting has been added to control the minimum row count estimate
  for buffer scans of foreign key and unqiueness checks. It defaults to 0. [#141378][#141378]

<h3 id="v24-1-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A bug has been fixed that could cause "nil
  pointer dereference" errors when executing statements with UDFs. The
  error could also occur when executing statements with some built-in
  functions, like obj_description. [#141651][#141651]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent SHOW CREATE TABLE
  from working if a database was offline (e.g., due to a RESTORE on that
  database). [#141510][#141510]
- Fixed a bug that would cause an internal error
  when the result of a RECORD-returning UDF was wrapped by another expression
  (such as COALESCE) within a VALUES clause. [#140648][#140648]
- Data distribution page in
  advanced debug will no longer crash if there are null
  values for `raw_sql_config` in `crdb_internal.zones`. [#140659][#140659]
