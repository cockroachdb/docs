## v24.1.3

Release Date: August 1, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-1-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`]({% link v23.2/explain-analyze.md %}) statements are now supported when executed via Cloud Console [SQL shell]({% link cockroachcloud/sql-shell.md %}). [#125563][#125563]
- Added the [`sql.auth.grant_option_inheritance.enabled` cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-auth-grant-option-inheritance-enabled). The default value is `true`, which maintains consistency with CockroachDB's previous behavior: users granted a privilege with [`WITH GRANT OPTION`]({% link v24.1/grant.md %}) can in turn grant that privilege to others. When `sql.auth.grant_option_inheritance.enabled` is set to `false`, the `GRANT OPTION` is not inherited through role membership, thereby preventing descendant roles from granting the privilege to others. However, the privilege itself continues to be inherited through role membership. [#126300][#126300]

<h3 id="v24-1-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- `crdb_internal.cluster_execution_insights.txt` and `crdb_internal.cluster_txn_execution_insights.txt` have been removed from the [debug zip]({% link v24.1/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}). These files contained cluster-wide insights for statements and transactions. Users can still rely on the [per-node execution]({% link v24.1/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}#files) insights in `crdb_internal.node_execution_insights.txt` and `crdb_internal.node_txn_execution_insights.txt`. [#125807][#125807]
- For the [TELEMETRY logging channel]({% link v24.1/logging.md %}#telemetry), TCL `sampled_query` events will now be sampled at the rate specified by the setting [`sql.telemetry.query_sampling.max_event_frequency`]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-telemetry-query-sampling-max-event-frequency), which is already used to limit the rate of sampling DML statements. [#126729][#126729]

<h3 id="v24-1-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where collection of [debug information]({% link v24.1/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}) for very long-running [jobs]({% link v24.1/show-jobs.md %}) could use excessive space in the `job_info` system table and cause some interactions with the jobs system to become slow. [#126122][#126122]
- Fixed a bug where a change to a [user-defined type (UDT)]({% link v24.1/create-type.md %}) could cause queries against tables using that type to fail with an error: `histogram.go:694: span must be fully contained in the bucket`. The change to the user-defined type could come directly from an [`ALTER TYPE`]({% link v24.1/alter-type.md %}) statement, or indirectly from an [`ALTER DATABASE ADD REGION`]({% link v24.1/alter-database.md %}#add-region) or [`DROP REGION`]({% link v24.1/alter-database.md %}#drop-region) statement (which implicitly change the [`crdb_internal_region`]({% link v24.1/alter-table.md %}#set-the-table-locality-to-regional-by-row) type). This bug has existed since UDTs were introduced in v20.2. [#125800][#125800]
- Fixed a bug in which constant [`LIKE`]({% link v24.1/sql-feature-support.md %}#scalar-expressions-and-boolean-formulas) patterns containing certain sequences of backslashes did not become constrained scans. This bug has been present since v21.1.13 when support for building constrained scans from `LIKE` patterns containing backslashes was added. [#125539][#125539]
- Fixed the statistics estimation code in the [optimizer]({% link v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) so it does not use the empty histograms produced if [histogram collection]({% link v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#control-histogram-collection) has been disabled during stats collection due to excessive memory utilization. Now the optimizer will rely on distinct counts instead of the empty histograms and should produce better plans as a result. This bug has existed since CockroachDB v22.1. [#126153][#126153]
- Fixed a bug where [`CREATE TABLE`]({% link v24.1/create-table.md %}) statements with [index expressions]({% link v24.1/expression-indexes.md %}) could hit undefined column errors on [transaction retries]({% link v24.1/transactions.md %}#transaction-retries). [#125967][#125967]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would hit an internal error when evaluating [`INSERT`s]({% link v24.1/insert.md %}) into [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link v24.1/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) tables where the source is a [`VALUES` clause]({% link v24.1/selection-queries.md %}#values-clause) with a single row and at least one boolean expression. The bug was introduced in v23.2.0. [#125505][#125505]
- Fixed a bug in [`cockroach debug tsdump`]({% link v24.1/cockroach-debug-tsdump.md %}) where the command fails when a custom SQL port is used and the [`--format=raw`]({% link v24.1/cockroach-debug-tsdump.md %}#flags) flag is provided. [#125980][#125980]
- Fixed a bug where a [user-defined function (UDF)]({% link v24.1/user-defined-functions.md %}) that shared a name with a [built-in function]({% link v24.1/functions-and-operators.md %}#built-in-functions) would not be resolved, even if the UDF had higher precedence according to the [`search_path`]({% link v24.1/sql-name-resolution.md %}#search-path) variable. [#126296][#126296]
- Fixed a bug that caused [background jobs]({% link v24.1/show-jobs.md %}) to incorrectly respect a statement timeout.  [#126820][#126820]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION`]({% link v24.1/alter-database.md %}#drop-region) could fail if any tables under the given database have [indexes on expressions]({% link v24.1/expression-indexes.md %}). [#126599][#126599]
- Fixed a PostgreSQL incompatibility bug when inputting `public` as user name for [built-in functions]({% link v24.1/functions-and-operators.md %}) such as `has_database_privilege` and `has_schema_privilege`. [#126851][#126851]
- Fixed a bug when [restoring]({% link v24.1/restore.md %}) a database with a [composite type]({% link v24.1/create-type.md %}#create-a-composite-data-type). [#126428][#126428]
- Fixed a bug where the [Databases]({% link v24.1/ui-databases-page.md %}) page crashed if the range information was not available. [#127092][#127092]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate an [`IS NOT NULL`]({% link v24.1/null-handling.md %}#nulls-and-simple-comparisons) filter if it was applied to non-`NULL` tuples that had `NULL` elements, such as `(1, NULL)` or `(NULL, NULL)`. This bug has existed since v20.2. [#126938][#126938]
- The `sql_sequence_cached_node` value of the [`serial_normalization` setting]({% link v24.1/serial.md %}#modes-of-operation) was not correctly formatted. This could lead to errors while connecting to CockroachDB if the default value of `serial_normalization` was set to `serial_normalization`. The formatting bug was fixed, which also fixes the errors when connecting. [#127675][#127675]

<h3 id="v24-1-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Starting a `cockroach` process will no longer flush buffered [logs]({% link v24.1/logging-overview.md %}) to configured [logging sinks]({% link v24.1/configure-logs.md %}#configure-log-sinks) unless the process is running under `systemd`, where cockroach runs with the `NOTIFY_SOCKET` environment variable. [#126305][#126305]
- [Schema changes]({% link v24.1/online-schema-changes.md %}) that cause a data backfill, such as adding a non-nullable column or changing the primary key, will now split and scatter the temporary indexes used to perform the change. This reduces the chance of causing a [write hotspot]({% link v24.1/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#hot-spots) that can slow down foreground traffic. [#126684][#126684]
