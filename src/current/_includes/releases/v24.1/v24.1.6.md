## v24.1.6

Release Date: October 17, 2024

{% include "_includes/releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md" release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-1-6-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Updated the cluster setting [`changefeed.sink_io_workers`](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-changefeed-sink-io-workers) with all the [changefeed sinks](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md) that support the setting. [#130373][#130373]
- Added two network metrics, `changefeed.network.bytes_in` and `changefeed.network.bytes_out`. These metrics track the number of bytes sent by individual [changefeeds](/docs/v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md) to the following sinks:
	- [Kafka sinks](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md#kafka). If [child metrics are enabled](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-server-child-metrics-enabled), the metric will have a `kafka` label.
	- [Webhook sinks](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md#webhook-sink). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `webhook` label.
	- [Pub/Sub sinks](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md#google-cloud-pub-sub). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `pubsub` label.
	- [SQL sink](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-for.md). If child metrics are enabled, the metric will have a `sql` label. [#130583][#130583]
- Added a `changefeed.total_ranges` metric that can be used to monitor the number of ranges that are watched by [changefeed](/docs/v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md) aggregators. It shares the same polling interval as `changefeed.lagging_ranges`, which is controlled by the existing `lagging_ranges_polling_interval` option. [#130983][#130983]
- Disambiguated [metrics](/docs/v24.1/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md) and logs for the two buffers used by the KV feed. The following metrics now have a suffix indicating which buffer they correspond to: `changefeed.buffer_entries.*`, `changefeed.buffer_entries_mem.*`, `changefeed.buffer_pushback_nanos.*`. The old versions are kept for backward compatibility, though using the new format is recommended. [#131418][#131418]
- Added timers around key parts of the [changefeed](/docs/v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md) pipeline to help debug feeds experiencing issues. The `changefeed.stage.{stage}.latency` metrics now emit latency histograms for each stage. The metric respects the changefeed `scope` label for debugging specific feeds. [#131429][#131429]

<h3 id="v24-1-6-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Beginning with v24.1.6, CockroachDB v24.1 is in [Long term support (LTS)](releases/release-support-policy.md).

<h3 id="v24-1-6-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a `ranges.decommissioning` [metric](/docs/v24.1/metrics.md) representing the number of ranges that have a replica on a [decommissioning node](/docs/v24.1/node-shutdown.md?filters=decommission). [#130248][#130248]
- You can now configure the log format for the [`stderr` log sink](/docs/v24.1/configure-logs.md#output-to-stderr) by setting the `stderr.format` field in the [YAML configuration](/docs/v24.1/configure-logs.md#yaml-payload). [#131534][#131534]

<h3 id="v24-1-6-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [DB Console](/docs/v24.1/ui-overview.md) will now show a notification alerting customers without an Enterprise license to [upcoming license changes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/enterprise-license-update/) with a link to more information. [#130426][#130426]

<h3 id="v24-1-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in which `SHOW CLUSTER SETTING FOR VIRTUAL CLUSTER` would erroneously return `NULL` for some settings. [#128783][#128783]
- Addressed a bug in the [upgrade](/docs/v24.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.md) pre-condition for repairing descriptor corruption, which could lead to upgrade finalization being stuck. [#130518][#130518]
- Fixed a potential memory leak in [changefeeds](/docs/v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md) using a [cloud storage sink](/docs/v24.1/changefeed-sinks.md#cloud-storage-sink). The memory leak could occur if both [`changefeed.fast_gzip.enabled`](/docs/v24.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-changefeed-fast-gzip-enabled) and `changefeed.cloudstorage.async_flush.enabled` were `true`, and the changefeed received an error while attempting to write to the cloud storage sink. [#130601][#130601]
- Fixed a bug in which some [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](/docs/v24.1/select-for-update.md) or [`SELECT FOR SHARE`](/docs/v24.1/select-for-update.md) queries using `NOWAIT` could still block on locked rows when using the `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` [session setting](/docs/v24.1/session-variables.md) under [`SERIALIZABLE`](/docs/v24.1/demo-serializable.md) isolation. This bug was introduced with [`optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable`](/docs/v24.1/session-variables.md#optimizer-use-lock-op-for-serializable) in v23.2.0. [#130429][#130429]
- Fixed a bug that caused the [optimizer](/docs/v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.md) to plan unnecessary post-query uniqueness checks during [`INSERT`](/docs/v24.1/insert.md), [`UPSERT`](/docs/v24.1/upsert.md), and [`UPDATE`](/docs/v24.1/update.md) statements on tables with [partial](/docs/v24.1/partial-indexes.md), [unique](/docs/v24.1/create-index.md#unique-indexes), [hash-sharded indexes](/docs/v24.1/hash-sharded-indexes.md). These unnecessary checks added overhead to execution of these statements, and caused the statements to error when executed under [`READ COMMITTED`](/docs/v24.1/read-committed.md) isolation. [#130569][#130569]
- Previously, if a connection was attempting a [schema change](/docs/v24.1/online-schema-changes.md) while the same schema objects were being dropped, it was possible for the connection to be incorrectly dropped. This is now fixed. [#130961][#130961]
- Fixed a bug that could result in the inability to garbage collect an [MVCC](/docs/v24.1/architecture/storage-layer.md#mvcc) range tombstone within a [global table](/docs/v24.1/global-tables.md). [#130950][#130950]
- Fixed a bug that could cause errors with the message `internal error: Non-nullable column ...` when executing statements under [`READ COMMITTED`](/docs/v24.1/read-committed.md) isolation that involved tables with [`NOT NULL`](/docs/v24.1/not-null.md) virtual columns. [#131064][#131064]
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect results for queries containing a correlated subquery with a [`GROUP BY`](/docs/v24.1/select-clause.md#create-aggregate-groups) or [`DISTINCT ON`](/docs/v24.1/select-clause.md#eliminate-duplicate-rows) operator referencing an outer column. This issue would occur if the correlated subquery was in the input of a [`SELECT`](/docs/v24.1/select-clause.md) or [`JOIN`](/docs/v24.1/joins.md) operator that had a filter equating the outer-column reference to a non-outer column in the grouping operator's input, while the grouping column set did not include the replacement column but functionally determined it. This bug was introduced in v23.1. [#130989][#130989]
- The AWS endpoint and cloud custom HTTP client configuration are now considered when [implicit authentication](/docs/v24.1/cloud-storage-authentication.md) is used for cloud storage. Previously, these were only considered when using explicit credentials. [#131202][#131202]
- Fixed a bug where jobs created in sessions with non-zero session timezone offsets could hang before starting or report incorrect creation times when viewed in [`SHOW JOBS`](/docs/v24.1/show-jobs.md) and the DB Console. [#131406][#131406]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a [changefeed](/docs/v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md) from being able to resume after being paused for a prolonged period of time. [#130920][#130920]
- Fixed a bug where backup schedules could advance a protected timestamp too early, which caused incremental backups to fail. [#131390][#131390]

<h3 id="v24-1-6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The [query optimizer](/docs/v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.md) now plans limited, [partial index](/docs/v24.1/partial-indexes.md) scans in more cases when the new session setting [`optimizer_push_limit_into_project_filtered_scan`](/docs/v24.1/session-variables.md) is set to `on`. [#130336][#130336]
