<h3 id="v24-1-2-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added error messages for unsupported Apache Pulsar [changefeed]({% link v24.1/create-changefeed.md %}) sink parameters, e.g. `topic_prefix is not yet supported`. [#124666][#124666]
- Fixed a bug that was present since v22.2 where [changefeeds]({% link v24.1/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) with long-running [initial scans]({% link v24.1/create-changefeed.md %}#initial-scan) might incorrectly restore checkpoint job progress and drop events during [changefeed restarts]({% link v24.1/changefeed-messages.md %}#duplicate-messages) due to transient errors or node restarts. The bug was most likely to occur in clusters with the following contributing factors:
    - The `changefeed.shutdown_checkpoint.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) was enabled.
    - The cluster settings `changefeed.frontier_checkpoint_frequency` and `low changefeed.frontier_highwater_lag_checkpoint_threshold` were set low, which resulted in the initial scan taking many multiples of the configured frequency to complete.
    - There were multiple target tables with significant differences in row counts in one changefeed.
    - The changefeed target tables were large with many ranges.
    - The initial scan took a long time to complete (an hour or longer). [#124996][#124996]

<h3 id="v24-1-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Improved [disk usage metric reporting]({% link v24.1/ui-cluster-overview-page.md %}#capacity-metrics) over volumes that dynamically change their size over the life of the `cockroach` process. [#125050][#125050]
- The default values for the following [cluster settings]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}) were updated from `100000` to `7500`. These settings control the maximum number of [fingerprints]({% link v24.1/ui-statements-page.md %}#sql-statement-fingerprints) (distinct combinations of statements and [transactions]({% link v24.1/transactions.md %})) CockroachDB can store in memory, with stats being flushed on a `10m` [interval]({% link v24.1/interval.md %}) by default. You can increase these settings if your workload produces more unique fingerprints than this amount within the flush interval, and you notice that SQL stats are missing. [cockroachdb/cockroach#125554][#125554]
  - [`sql.metrics.max_mem_stmt_fingerprints`]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-metrics-max-mem-stmt-fingerprints)
  - [`sql.metrics.max_mem_txn_fingerprints`]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-metrics-max-mem-txn-fingerprints)

<h3 id="v24-1-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The favicon now renders properly for [DB Console]({% link v24.1/ui-overview.md %}), along with other image files. [#122706][#122706]

<h3 id="v24-1-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- [`SHOW TYPES`]({% link v24.1/show-types.md %}) now includes [user-defined composite types]({% link v24.1/create-type.md %}#create-a-composite-data-type). It had omitted those types ever since composite types were added in v23.1. [#124817][#124817]
- Fixed a crash introduced in v24.1.0-beta.2 that could occur when planning [statistics]({% link v24.1/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#table-statistics) collection on a table with a [virtual computed column]({% link v24.1/computed-columns.md %}) using a [user-defined type]({% link v24.1/create-type.md %}) when the [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-stats-virtual-computed-columns-enabled) `sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled` (introduced in v24.1.0-alpha.1) was set to `true`. [#124996][#124996]
- Fixed handling in the [declarative schema changer]({% link v24.1/online-schema-changes.md %}#declarative-schema-changer) when columns are included in the `STORING()` clause of a [`CREATE INDEX`]({% link v24.1/create-index.md %}) statement. CockroachDB now checks if the column is virtual up-front, and properly detects when a column is already handled by an existing [`INDEX`]({% link v24.1/indexes.md %}) when the column name has UTF-8 characters. [#125153][#125153]
- Fixed a bug where a change to a [user-defined type]({% link v24.1/create-type.md %}) could cause queries against tables using that type to fail with an error message like: `"histogram.go:694: span must be fully contained in the bucket"`. The change to the user-defined type could come directly from an [`ALTER TYPE`]({% link v24.1/alter-type.md %}) statement, or indirectly from an [`ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION`]({% link v24.1/alter-database.md %}#add-region) or [`DROP REGION`]({% link v24.1/alter-database.md %}#drop-region) statement (which implicitly changes the `crdb_internal_region` type). This bug had existed since UDTs were introduced in v20.2. [#124810][#124810]
- Fixed a bug where [telemetry logs]({% link v24.1/logging.md %}#telemetry) had the same [statement fingerprint]({% link v24.1/ui-statements-page.md %}#sql-statement-fingerprints) ID for different SQL statements. [#125000][#125000]
- Fixed an issue where [adding a column]({% link v24.1/alter-table.md %}#add-column) with a default value of an empty [array]({% link v24.1/array.md %}) would not succeed. [#125325][#125325]
- [`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE`]({% link v24.1/alter-table.md %}) will now fail with a well-formed error message and code `42601` if a statement tries to add a [unique constraint]({% link v24.1/unique.md %}) on an expression. [#125417][#125417]
- Fixed a bug where the [`public` schema]({% link v24.1/schema-design-overview.md %}#schemas) would be created with the wrong owner. Previously the [`admin` role](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/security-reference/authorization#roles) would own the `public` schema. Now, the database owner is also the owner of the `public` schema. The owner can be altered after the schema is created. [#125533][#125533]
- Fixed a bug in v24.1, v23.2, and v23.1 where using the `changefeed.aggregator.flush_jitter` [cluster setting]({% link v24.1/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-changefeed-aggregator-flush-jitter) with the [`min_checkpoint_frequency`]({% link v24.1/create-changefeed.md %}#min-checkpoint-frequency) option set to `0` could cause panics. [#125459][#125459]
- The log message `"expiration of liveness record ... is not greater than expiration of the previous lease ... after liveness heartbeat"` is no longer generated. [#125449][#125449]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2.0 in which CockroachDB would hit an internal error when evaluating [`INSERT`s]({% link v24.1/insert.md %}) into [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link v24.1/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) tables where the source was a `VALUES` clause with a single row and at least one boolean expression. [#126209][#126209]

<h3 id="v24-1-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved the efficiency of error handling in the [vectorized execution engine]({% link v24.1/vectorized-execution.md %}) to reduce the CPU overhead of statement timeout handling and reduce the potential for more statement timeouts. [#124996][#124996]
- Some [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v24.1/security-reference/authorization#managing-privileges) checks when scanning the `crdb_internal.system_jobs` internal table now happen once before the scan, instead of once for each row. This improves performance for queries that read from `crdb_internal.system_jobs`. [#125250][#125250]

<h3 id="v24-1-2-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- A [changefeed]({% link v24.1/create-changefeed.md %}) optimization to reduce duplicates during aggregator restarts has been disabled due to poor performance. [#124996][#124996]
