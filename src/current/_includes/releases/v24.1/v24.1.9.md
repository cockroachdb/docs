- Added the `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting. When set to `on`, type-checking comparisons involving `VARCHAR` columns behave as they did in all previous versions. When set to `off`, type-checking of these comparisons is more strict and queries that previously succeeded may now error with the message `unsupported comparison operator`. These errors can be fixed by adding explicit type casts. The `legacy_varchar_typing` session setting is on by default. [#137946][#137946]
