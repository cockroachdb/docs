<h3 id="v25-2-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an `INSERT` statement could fail with a type checking error while adding a `BIT(n)` column. [#152964][#152964]
- Fixed a bug where index creation could fail due to validation errors if the schema change was retried or paused/resumed during the backfill. [#153596][#153596]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v25.1.0 that would
  cause a node panic if a `SIGINT` signal was sent during the execution of
  a `CHECK EXTERNAL CONNECTION` command. [#153601][#153601]
- Fixed a bug where `ALTER POLICY` was incorrectly dropping dependency tracking for functions, sequences, or types in policy expressions. [#153808][#153808]
- Fixed a runtime error that could be hit if a new secondary index had a name collision with a primary index. [#154015][#154015]
- Fixed a bug that caused panics when executing `COPY` into a table with hidden columns and expression indexes. The panic only occurred when the session setting `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` was enabled. This bug was introduced with `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` in v22.1.0. [#154290][#154290]
- Disable a feature
  (kv.lock_table.unreplicated_lock_reliability.split.enabled) that could
  lead to a node crash. [#155418][#155418]

<h3 id="v25-2-7-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- fixes a bug where the presence of duplicate temporary
  tables in a backup caused the restore to fail with an error containing
  the text 'restoring table desc and namespace
  entries: table already exists'.
