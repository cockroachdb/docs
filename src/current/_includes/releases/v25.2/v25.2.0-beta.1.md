<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Set-returning functions (SRF) are now supported in PL/pgSQL. A PL/pgSQL SRF can be created by declaring the return type as `SETOF <type>` or `TABLE`.
 [#143820][#143820]
- Usage of `TG_ARGV` in trigger functions is now disallowed by default. The session setting `allow_create_trigger_function_with_argv_references` can be set to `true` to allow usage (with 1-based indexing).
 [#143827][#143827]
- The return type of the `workload_index_recs` built-in function now includes two columns. The first column, `index_rec`, remains a `STRING` type and contains the index recommendation. The second column, `fingerprint_ids`, is new and has the `BYTES[]` type. [#142927][#142927]
- The job description for `AUTO CREATE PARTIAL STATS` now clearly indicates that the job is for automatic partial statistics collection, improving `system.jobs` visibility and debugging.
 [#143283][#143283]
- A new `execution time` statistic is now reported on `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output for most operators. Previously, this statistic was only available on the DistSQL diagrams in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` output.
 [#143857][#143857]
- `() is unknown` is now supported in JSONPath queries. For example, `SELECT jsonb_path_query('{}', '($ < 1) is unknown');`.
 [#143668][#143668]
- `starts with ""` is now supported in JSONPath queries. For example, `SELECT jsonb_path_query('"abcdef"', '$
  starts with "abc"');`.

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `kv.mvcc_gc.queue_kv_admission_control.enabled` cluster setting was retired.
 [#143124][#143124]
- `debug zip` queries are now attributed to internal SQL metrics. As a result, users will no longer see their impact on the SQL charts in the DB Console.
 [#143711][#143711]

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an issue where hot range logging for virtual clusters omitted some hot ranges.
 [#143775][#143775]
- MVCC garbage collection is now fully subject to IO admission control. Previously, it was possible for MVCC GC to cause store overload (such as LSM inversion) when a large amount of data would become eligible for garbage collection. Should any issues arise from subjecting MVCC GC to admission control, the `kv.mvcc_gc.queue_kv_admission_control.enabled` cluster setting can be set to `false` to restore the previous behavior.
 [#143122][#143122]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a stack overflow during execution of a prepared statement that invoked a PL/pgSQL routine with a loop. The bug existed in versions v23.2.22, v24.1.15, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, v25.1.3, and pre-release versions of v25.2 prior to v25.2.0-alpha.3.
 [#144027][#144027]
- Fixed an issue where change data capture queries on tables without columns would fail with an internal error: `unable to determine result columns`.
 [#142068][#142068]
- Previously, statement bundle collection could encounter `not enough privileges` errors when retrieving necessary information (e.g., cluster settings, table statistics, etc.) when the user that requested the bundle was different from the user that actually ran the query. This is now fixed. The bug was present since v20.2 and would result in partially incomplete bundles.
 [#144178][#144178]
- Fixed an issue where databases, tables, and indexes were not appearing on the Hot Ranges page for application virtual clusters.
