Release Date: February 6, 2026

<h3 id="v25-2-12-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Changefeeds now support the `partition_alg`
  option for specifying a kafka partitioning algorithm. Currently `fnv-1a`
  (default) and `murmur2` are supported. The option is only valid on kafka
  v2 sinks. This is protected by the cluster setting
  `changefeed.partition_alg.enabled`. An example usage: `SET CLUSTER SETTING
  changefeed.partition_alg.enabled=true; CREATE CHANGEFEED ... INTO
  'kafka://...' WITH partition_alg='murmur2';` Note that if a changefeed is
  created using the murmur2 algorithm, and then the cluster setting is
  disabled, the changefeed will continue using the murmur2 algorithm
  unless the changefeed is altered to use a differed `partition_alg`. [#161525][#161525]

<h3 id="v25-2-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when a statistics creation task panicked. [#160419][#160419]
- Fixed a bug where dropping a trigger on a table with a self-referencing foreign key could cause a missing reference between the objects. [#161025][#161025]
- Fixed a bug where IMPORT with AVRO data using OCF format could silently lose data if the underlying storage (e.g., S3) returned an error during read. Such errors are now properly reported. Other formats (specified via `data_as_binary_records` and `data_as_json_records` options) are unaffected. The bug has been present since about v20.1. [#161322][#161322]
- Fixed an error that occurred when using generic
  plan that generates a lookup join on indexes containing identity
  computed columns. [#162339][#162339]

<h3 id="v25-2-12-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Added a new session variable, `distsql_prevent_partitioning_soft_limited_scans`, which, when true, prevents scans with soft limits from being planned as multiple TableReaders by the physical planner. This should decrease the initial setup costs of some fully-distributed query plans. [#160630][#160630]

<h3 id="v25-2-12-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- `kv.transaction.write_buffering.enabled` is removed
  from the public cluster settings to better reflect its preview status. [#162027][#162027]
