## v25.2.1

Release Date: June 4, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v25-2-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `sql.metrics.application_name.enabled` and `sql.metrics.database_name.enabled` cluster settings. These settings default to `false`. Set them to `true` to include the application and database name, respectively, in supported metrics.
 [#144932][#144932]

<h3 id="v25-2-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the metric `changefeed.checkpoint.timestamp_count` that measures the number of unique timestamps in a changefeed span-level checkpoint. It may be useful to monitor this metric to determine if quantization settings should be changed.
 [#145223][#145223]
- Logs for hot ranges (`hot_ranges_stats` events) have been moved to the `HEALTH` logging channel.
 [#146762][#146762]

<h3 id="v25-2-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Schema insights that recommend replacing an index were previously a two-statement command consisting of a `CREATE INDEX` and a `DROP INDEX` statement. When these two DDL statements were run as a single batched command, it was possible for one statement to succeed and one to fail. This is because DDL statements do not have the same atomicity guarantees as other SQL statements in CockroachDB. Index-replacement insights are now a single `CREATE INDEX` statement followed by a comment with additional DDL statements to be run manually: an `ALTER INDEX ... NOT VISIBLE` statement, which makes the old index invisible to the optimizer, followed by a `DROP INDEX` statement that should only be run after making the old index invisible and verifying that workload performance is satisfactory.

<h3 id="v25-2-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Improved the performance of `SHOW CREATE TABLE` on multi-region databases with large numbers of objects.
 [#145004][#145004]
- Fixed a bug that could cause queries that perform work in parallel to ignore the requested quality-of-service level. Affected operations include lookup joins, DistSQL execution, and foreign-key checks.
 [#145363][#145363]
- Fixed a bug where running `DROP INDEX` on a hash-sharded index did not properly detect dependencies from functions and procedures on the shard column. This caused the `DROP INDEX` statement to fail with an internal validation error. Now the statement returns a correct error message, and using `DROP INDEX ... CASCADE` works as expected by dropping the dependent functions and procedures.
 [#145386][#145386]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to schema changes hanging after a cluster recovered from availability issues.
 [#145545][#145545]
- Previously, on a table with multiple column families, CockroachDB could encounter a `Non-nullable column "‹×›:‹×›" with no value` error in rare cases during table statistics collection. The bug was present since v19.2 and is now fixed.
 [#145576][#145576]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a row-level TTL job to fail with the error "comparison of two different versions of enum" if an `ENUM` type referenced by the table experienced a schema change.
 [#145917][#145917]
- Fixed a bug where the physical cluster replication (PCR) reader catalog job could hit validation errors when schema objects had dependencies between them (for example, when a sequence's default expression was being removed).
 [#145999][#145999]
- Creating a vector index on a table that contains a `NULL` vector value will no longer cause an internal error.
 [#146017][#146017]
- Row-level security (RLS) `SELECT` policies during `UPDATE` operations are now only applied when referenced columns appear in the `SET` or `WHERE` clauses, matching the behavior of PostgreSQL. This improves compatibility.
 [#146128][#146128]
- Fixed an internal assertion failure that could occur during operations like `ALTER TYPE` or `ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION` when temporary tables were present.
 [#146196][#146196]
- Fixed incorrect application of row-level security (RLS) `SELECT` policies to `RETURNING` clauses in `INSERT` and `UPDATE` when no table columns were referenced.
 [#146292][#146292]
- Fixed a bug that prevented `TRUNCATE` from succeeding if any indexes on the table had back-reference dependencies, such as from a view or function referencing the index.
 [#146326][#146326]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to a node stall.
 [#146409][#146409]
- Fixed an integer overflow in the `split_part` function when using extremely negative field positions like Go's `math.MinInt64`.
 [#146413][#146413]
- Fixed a bug where an invalid comment in the `system.comment` table for a schema object could make it inaccessible.
 [#146418][#146418]
- Fixed a bug where a CockroachDB node could crash when executing `DO` statements that contain currently unsupported DDL statements like `CREATE TYPE` in a non-default configuration (additional logging needed to be enabled, e.g., via the `sql.log.all_statements.enabled` cluster setting). This bug was introduced in v25.1.
 [#146501][#146501]
- Prevent use of future timestamps when using `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` with `CREATE TABLE ... AS` and materialized views. Previously, such timestamps could cause errors, delays, or hangs.
 [#146605][#146605]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would not use the vectorized fast path for `COPY` when it was supported. The bug was only present in previous v25.2 releases.
 [#146697][#146697]
- Fixed an internal error that could be hit when `ADD COLUMN UNIQUE` and `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` were executed within the same transaction.
 [#146743][#146743]
- Fixed a bug where `ALTER TABLE` operations with multiple commands could generate invalid zone configurations.
 [#146750][#146750]
- Fixed a bug in v25.2.0 where a vector search operator could drop user-supplied filters if the same vector column was indexed twice and a vector index with no prefix columns was defined after a vector index with prefix columns.
 [#146849][#146849]
- Fixed an issue where updating child metrics and reinitializing metrics at the same time could cause scrape errors.
 [#147531][#147531]
- Fixed a runtime panic in the `substring_index` function that occurred when the count argument was the minimum 64-bit integer value.
 [#147550][#147550]
- Fixed a memory leak in index backfill jobs where completed spans were duplicated in memory on each progress update after resuming from a checkpoint. This could cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors when backfilling indexes on large tables with many ranges. This bug affected release version v25.2.0 and pre-release versions v25.2.0-alpha.3 through v25.2.0-rc.1.
