## v25.2.2

Release Date: June 25, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v25-2-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- When `server.telemetry.hot_ranges_stats.enabled` cluster setting is enabled, nodes now log hot ranges every minute if they exceed 250ms of CPU time per second. In multi-tenant deployments, this check occurs every 5 minutes at the cluster level, improving visibility into transient performance issues.
 [#146887][#146887]
- Added a new metric, `kv.loadsplitter.cleardirection`, which increments when the load-based splitter observes that more than 80% of replica access samples are moving in a single direction (either left/descending or right/ascending).
 [#147169][#147169]

<h3 id="v25-2-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The Hot Ranges page node filter has been moved out of the main filter container and now filters nodes on the backend to reduce load time.
 [#147778][#147778]

<h3 id="v25-2-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause the `cockroach` process to `segfault` when collecting runtime execution traces (typically collected via the **Advanced Debug** page in the Console).
 [#146886][#146886]
- Fixed a bug where the `kv.rangefeed.closed_timestamp.slow_ranges` would not be incremented when a rangefeed closed timestamp was slower than the target threshold.
 [#146975][#146975]
- Fixed a bug that could cause an `AFTER` trigger to fail with `client already committed or rolled back the transaction` if the query also contained foreign-key cascades. The bug had existed since `AFTER` triggers were introduced in v24.3.
 [#146977][#146977]
- Fixed a bug that caused the SQL Activity > Statement Fingerprint page to fail to load details for statements run with application names containing a `#` character.
 [#147223][#147223]
- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate the `to_regclass`, `to_regnamespace`, `to_regproc`, `to_regprocedure`, `to_regrole`, and `to_regtype` built-in functions when the query using them was evaluated in a distributed fashion. The bug was introduced with these built-in functions in v23.1 and is now fixed.
 [#147376][#147376]
- Fixed a bug that caused the optimizer to ignore index hints when optimizing some forms of prepared statements. This could result in one of two unexepcted behaviors: a query errors with the message `index cannot be used for this query` when the index can actually be used; or a query uses an index that does not adhere to the hint. The hints relevant to this bug are regular index hints, e.g., `SELECT * FROM tab@index`, `FORCE_INVERTED_INDEX`, and `FORCE_ZIGZAG`.
 [#147417][#147417]
- Fixed a bug where the `pg_catalog.pg_policy` table could contain duplicate OID values when multiple tables had policies with the same policy ID. All rows in `pg_policy` now have unique OIDs as required.
 [#147438][#147438]
- Fixed a bug that could cause stable expressions to be folded in cached query plans. The bug could cause stable expressions like `current_setting` to return the wrong result if used in a prepared statement. The bug was introduced in v23.2.22, v24.1.14, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, and the v25.2 alpha.
 [#147460][#147460]
- Fixed a runtime panic in the `substring_index` function that occurred when the count argument was the minimum 64-bit integer value.
 [#147549][#147549]
- Fixed a memory leak in index backfill jobs where completed spans were duplicated in memory on each progress update after resuming from a checkpoint. This could cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors when backfilling indexes on large tables with many ranges. This bug affected release version v25.2.0 and pre-release versions v25.2.0-alpha.3 through v25.2.0-rc.1.
 [#147563][#147563]
- Fixed a bug where prepared statements on schema changes could fail with runtime errors.
 [#147671][#147671]
- Fixed a bug where `ALTER TABLE` was modifying identity attributes on columns not backed by a sequence.
 [#147711][#147711]

<h3 id="v25-2-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- TTL jobs now respond to cluster topology changes by restarting and rebalancing across available nodes.
 [#147083][#147083]

<h3 id="v25-2-2-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- fixes an issue with LDR where the presence of a unique
  index may cause spurious DLQ entries if the unique index has a smaller
  index id than the primary key index. [#147350][#147350]
