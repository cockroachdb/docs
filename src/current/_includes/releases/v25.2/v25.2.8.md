- In order to selectively capture
  traces for transactions running in an active workload without haing
  to capture them via statement diagnostic bundles, customers can now
  use the `sql.trace.txn.sample_rate` cluster setting to enable tracing
  for a fraction of their workload. The `sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold`
  will still need to be set to a positive value to provide a filter
  for how slow a transaction needs to be after being sampled to merit
  emitting a trace. Traces are emitted to the `SQL_EXEC` logging
  channel. [#156409][#156409]

- Fixed a bug in the `cockroach node drain` command where draining a node using virtual clusters (such as clusters running Physical Cluster Replication (PCR)) could return before the drain was complete, possibly resulting in shutting down the node while it still had active SQL clients and range leases.
