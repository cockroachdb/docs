      A major improvement to changefeeds significantly reduces the number of <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v25.2/changefeed-messages#duplicate-messages">duplicate messages</a> emitted during restarts and retries. This means more accurate data delivery, lower processing overhead for downstream consumers, and a smoother experience overall.

      An enriched changefeed format has been introduced in Preview that aligns with the Debezium message structure, making it significantly easier to integrate CockroachDB into existing CDC pipelines. This new format adds structured metadata and flexibility to the changefeed message body, allowing seamless migrations from PostgreSQL or Debezium-based systems without re-architecting downstream services. Whether you're working with real-time analytics, event-driven systems, or audit logs, the enriched format provides clear context about each change event, including source information, schema, operation type, and timestamps. It simplifies debugging, enhances observability, and makes changefeeds more useful in complex, distributed architectures.    </p>

    <p class="feature-description">
      Controlling who can access what data is more important than ever as organizations scale and modernize their data infrastructure. As enterprises move to modernize their critical databases, they need fine-grained, built-in access controls that go beyond table-level permissions. That’s why, with the 25.2 release of CockroachDB, we’re introducing Row-Level Security — a powerful feature that allows you to define and enforce access policies at the row level, directly within the database. This form of mandatory access control enables developers and operators to tightly govern data visibility based on user roles or attributes — making it a natural fit for securing sensitive workloads and building robust multi-tenant applications. With row-level security, CockroachDB makes it simple to isolate data, comply with regulatory requirements, and reduce application-side complexity — all while maintaining performance at scale and with minimal application changes.

You'll learn about CockroachDB's seamless horizontal scalability, distributed transactions with strict ACID guarantees, and high availability and resilience.
Cockroach University | [Practical First Steps with CockroachDB](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+practical-first-steps-with-crdb+self-paced/about) | This course will give you the tools you need to get started with CockroachDB. During the course, you will learn how to spin up a cluster, use the Admin UI to monitor cluster activity, and use SQL shell to solve a set of hands-on exercises.
Cockroach University | [Enterprise Application Development with CockroachDB](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+client-side-txn-handling+self-paced/about) | This course is the first in a series designed to equip you with best practices for mastering application-level (client-side) transaction management in CockroachDB. We'll dive deep on common differences between CockroachDB and legacy SQL databases and help you sidestep challenges you might encounter when migrating to CockroachDB from Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
Cockroach University | [Building a Highly Resilient Multi-region Database using CockroachDB](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+intro-to-resilience-in-multi-region+self-paced/about) | This course is part of a series introducing solutions to running low-latency, highly resilient applications for data-intensive workloads on CockroachDB. In this course we focus on surviving large-scale infrastructure failures like losing an entire cloud region without losing data during recovery. We'll show you how to use CockroachDB survival goals in a multi-region cluster to implement a highly resilient database that survives node or network failures across multiple regions with zero data loss.
