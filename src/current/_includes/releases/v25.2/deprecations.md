The following deprecations are announced in v25.2.

- The [`ui.display_timezone` cluster setting]({% link v25.2/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-ui-display-timezone) is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If it has been set, its value will automatically be applied to the new setting `ui.default_timezone`, which takes precedence. For further detail, refer to [DB Console timezone configuration]({% link v25.2/ui-overview.md %}#db-console-timezone-configuration).
- The [`EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR`]({% link v25.2/changefeed-for.md %}) SQL statement is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead, create a sinkless changefeed that emits messages directly to a SQL client with the [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`]({% link v25.2/create-changefeed.md %}#create-a-sinkless-changefeed) statement.
