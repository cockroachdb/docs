## v25.2.0-beta.3

Release Date: April 28, 2025

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` and `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` now send a notice that vector indexes will be offline during the change operation when the `sql_safe_updates` session setting is disabled. [#144601][#144601]
- Vector indexes do not support mutation while being created with `CREATE INDEX` or rebuilt with `ALTER PRIMARY KEY`. To prevent inadvertent application downtime, set the `sql_safe_updates` session setting to `false` when using `CREATE INDEX` or `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` with a vector index. [#144601][#144601]
- The variable arguments of polymorphic built-in functions (e.g., `concat`, `num_nulls`, `format`, `concat_ws`, etc.) no longer need to have the same type, matching PostgreSQL behavior. As a result, CockroachDB's type inference engine will no longer be able to infer argument types in some cases where it previously could, and there is a possibility that CockroachDB applications will encounter new errors. The new session variable `use_pre_25_2_variadic_builtins` restores the previous behavior (and limitations). [#144600][#144600]

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause a changefeed to complete erroneously when one of its watched tables encounters a schema change. [#144717][#144717]
- Fixed a bug in the DB Console where tables with page size dropdowns failed to update when a new page size option was selected. Tables now update correctly.
 [#144666][#144666]
- Fixed the following bugs in the **Schedules** page of the DB Console:
    - Where the **Schedules** page displayed only a subset of a cluster's schedules. The **Schedules** page now correctly displays all schedules.
    - Where manually updating the `show` or `status` parameters in the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/schedules?status=ACTIVE&show=50`) caused the **Schedules** page to fail to load.
 [#144807][#144807]
- Fixed a bug in the **SQL Activity Statements** page where filtering by **Statement Type** returned no results. The filter now works as expected.
 [#144851][#144851]
- Fixed a bug in the DB Console where the **Drop unused index** tag appeared multiple times for an index on the **Indexes** tab of the **Table Details** page.

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Triggers now perform the descriptor lookup for `TG_TABLE_SCHEMA` against a cache. This can significantly reduce trigger planning latency in multi-region databases. [#144521][#144521]
- The vector search optimizer rule now supports additional projections beyond the distance column, including the implicit projections added for virtual columns. [#144583][#144583]
