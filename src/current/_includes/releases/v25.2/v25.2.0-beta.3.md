<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` and `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` will now send a notice that vector indexes will be offline during the change operation when `sql_safe_updates` is disabled. [#144601][#144601]
- Vector indexes do not support mutation while being created with `CREATE INDEX `or rebuilt with `ALTER PRIMARY KEY`. To prevent inadvertent application downtime, both of these commands require that `sql_safe_updates` be set to `false` while operating on a vector index. [#144601][#144601]
- The behavior of polymorphic builtin functions is now more like PostgreSQL. These functions include: `concat`, `concat_ws`, `format` `json_build_array`, `json_build_objects`, `jsonb_build_array`, `jsonb_build_objects`, `num_notnulls`, `num_nulls`, `pg_column_size`.  Specifically, the variable arguments to these functions no longer need to all have the same type. As a result, CockroachDB's type inference engine will no longer be able to infer argument types in some cases where it previously could. While the new behavior matches PostgreSQL, previously working CockroachDB applications could encounter new errors. This patch introduces a new session variable `use_pre_25_2_variadic_builtins` to restore the previous behavior (and limitations). [#144600][#144600]

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause a changefeed to complete erroneously when one of its watched tables encounters a schema change. [#144717][#144717]
- Fixed a bug in the DB Console where tables with page size dropdowns failed to update when a new page size option was selected. Tables now update correctly.
 [#144666][#144666]
- Fixed the following bugs in the **Schedules** page of the DB Console:
    - Where the **Schedules** page displayed only a subset of a cluster's schedules. The **Schedules** page now correctly displays all schedules.
    - Where manually updating the `show` or `status` parameters in the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/schedules?status=ACTIVE&show=50`) caused the **Schedules** page to fail to load.
 [#144807][#144807]
- Fixed a bug in the **SQL Activity Statements** page where filtering by **Statement Type** returned no results. The filter now works as expected.
 [#144851][#144851]
- Fixed a bug in the DB Console where the **Drop unused index** tag appeared multiple times for an index on the **Indexes** tab of the **Table Details** page.
 [#144656][#144656]

<h3 id="v25-2-0-beta-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Triggers now perform the descriptor lookup for `TG_TABLE_SCHEMA` against a cache. This can significantly reduce trigger planning latency in multi-region databases. [#144521][#144521]
- The vector search optimizer rule now supports additional projections beyond the distance column, including the implicit projections added for virtual columns. [#144583][#144583]
