<h3 id="v25-2-10-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The background (elastic) store graphs for exhausted duration, and the wait duration histogram, have been separated from the foreground (regular) graphs. [#156868][#156868]

<h3 id="v25-2-10-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A mechanism that prevents unsafe replication changes from causing loss of quorum now functions correctly. An internal function has been fixed to properly return errors, enhancing the reliability of replication safeguards. [#156521][#156521]
- Fixed a bug that could cause internal errors for queries using generic query plans with `NULL` placeholder values. [#156977][#156977]

<h3 id="v25-2-10-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The cost of generic query plans is now calculated based on worst-case selectivities for placeholder equalities (e.g., `x = $1`). This reduces the chance of suboptimal generic query plans being chosen when `plan_cache_mode=auto`. [#156797][#156797]

<h3 id="v25-2-10-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- Span config reconciliation jobs no longer fail on the
  destination after failover from a PCR stream of a system virtual cluster. [#156810][#156810]
