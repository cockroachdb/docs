<h3 id="v26-1-0-rc-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added support for `SHOW STATEMENT HINTS`, which displays information about the statement hints (if any) associated with the given statement fingerprint string. The fingerprint is normalized in the same way as `EXPLAIN (FINGERPRINT)` before hints are matched. Example usage: `SHOW STATEMENT HINTS FOR ' SELECT * FROM xy WHERE x = 10 '` or `SHOW STATEMENT HINTS FOR $$ SELECT * FROM xy WHERE x = 10 $$ WITH DETAILS`. [#160865][#160865]
- Calling `information_schema.crdb_rewrite_inline_hints` now requires the REPAIRCLUSTER privilege. [#160946][#160946]
- Renamed the builtin function `crdb_internal.inject_hint` (introduced in v26.1.0-alpha.2) to `information_schema.crdb_rewrite_inline_hints`. [#160946][#160946]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-rc-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Changed goroutine profile dumps from human-readable `.txt.gz` files to binary proto `.pb.gz` files. This improves the performance of the goroutine dumper by eliminating brief in-process pauses that occurred when collecting goroutine stacks. [#160994][#160994]
- Added a new structured event of type `rewrite_inline_hints` that is emitted when an inline-hints rewrite rule is added using `information_schema.crdb_rewrite_inline_hints`. This event is written to both the event log and the OPS channel. [#161035][#161035]
- Added a new metric `sql.query.with_statement_hints.count` that is incremented whenever a statement is executed with one or more external statement hints applied. An example of an external statement hint is an inline-hints rewrite rule added by calling `information_schema.crdb_rewrite_inline_hints`. [#161085][#161085]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-rc-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The **SQL Activity** > **Sessions** page now defaults the **Session Status** filter to **Active, Idle** to exclude closed sessions. [#160937][#160937]
- Changed the unit of measurement for admission control duration metrics from microseconds to nanoseconds. The following metrics are affected: `admission.granter.slots_exhausted_duration.kv`, `admission.granter.cpu_load_short_period_duration.kv`, `admission.granter.cpu_load_long_period_duration.kv`, `admission.granter.io_tokens_exhausted_duration.kv`, `admission.granter.elastic_io_tokens_exhausted_duration.kv`, and `admission.elastic_cpu.nanos_exhausted_duration`. Note that dashboards displaying these metrics will show a discontinuity at upgrade time, with pre-upgrade values appearing much lower due to the unit change. [#161076][#161076]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused `SHOW CREATE FUNCTION` to error when the function body contained casts from columns to user-defined types. [#160126][#160126]
- Fixed a bug where the `pprof` UI endpoints for allocs, heap, block, and mutex profiles ignored the seconds parameter and returned immediate snapshots instead of delta profiles. [#160804][#160804]
- Fixed a bug where schema changes adding a `NOT NULL` constraint could enter an infinite retry loop if a row violated the constraint and contained certain content (e.g., `"EOF"`). Such errors are now correctly classified and don't cause retries. [#160917][#160917]
- Fixed a bug in which inline-hints rewrite rules created with `information_schema.crdb_rewrite_inline_hints` were not correctly applied to statements run with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. This bug was introduced in v26.1.0-alpha.2. [#161312][#161312]
- Fixed a bug where IMPORT with AVRO data using OCF format could silently lose data if the underlying storage (e.g., S3) returned an error during read. Such errors are now properly reported. Other formats (specified via `data_as_binary_records` and `data_as_json_records` options) are unaffected. The bug has been present since about v20.1. [#161325][#161325]
