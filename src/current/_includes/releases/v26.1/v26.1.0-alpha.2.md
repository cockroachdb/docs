## v26.1.0-alpha.2

Release Date: December 10, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-2-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- We will be adding a new flag
  `--disallow-root-login` to the cockroach start command to explicitly allow
  restricting the root user from logging into the system. This change affects the
  [unstated, unchangeable root access
  rule](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/security-reference/authentication#the-unstated-unchangeable-root-access-rule)
  as part of compliance requirements. This flag is currently experimental and also
  needs an additional user setup for debug zip collection as disabling the root
  user affects the debug zip service. We currently do not validate if this user is
  set up or not.
  
  Note: Care must be taken to ensure none of the certificates that are in use by
  the cluster or the SQL/RPC clients have a root in the SAN fields since the flag
  will block access to that client. [#155216][#155216]
- A new `debug_user` certificate can now be used
  for privileged RPC access to collect debug information. The debug_user must be
  created manually using the `CREATE USER` command and can be audited using the
  `SHOW USERS` command. This user has privileged access to `serverpb` admin and
  status endpoints required for debug zip collection. [#155216][#155216]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Add new session variable `use_swap_mutations`
  which controls whether the new update swap and delete swap operators are
  enabled for use by UPDATE and DELETE statements. [#145019][#145019]
- Fixed a bug where the results of `ALTER SEQUENCE`'s increment and `SELECT nextval()` operations were not as expected. The value of a sequence after an `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement has executed on it is now consistent with a sequence created with those values. [#154489][#154489]
- SQL statements executed in stored procedures and user-defined functions now record SQL statistics, including latencies and execution metrics. These statistics appear on the **SQL Activity** and **Insights** pages of the DB Console. Limitation: SQL statements within a stored procedure or user-defined function are not collected for active statement diagnostics requests. Statement diagnostics remain available for top-level statement executions. [#156905][#156905]
- The `ALTER COLUMN ...` sequence identity
  commands are run by the declarative schema changer. [#157030][#157030]
- The `cumulative time spent waiting in admission control` is now displayed in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output when it is non-zero. This helps identify delays caused by admission control during query execution. [#158055][#158055]
- Restarting a sequence with an updated increment has the expected initial value. [#158065][#158065]
- The `cumulative time spent waiting in admission control` reported in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` now includes the time spent in quorum replication flow control. This update enhances the precision of wait time analysis, offering a more accurate depiction of query execution time by considering additional wait durations within the quorum replication processes. [#158076][#158076]
- A new "hint injection" ability has been
  added, which allows operators to dynamically inject inline hints into
  statements, without modifying the text of those statements. Hints can be
  injected using the builtin function `crdb_internal.inject_hint` with the
  target statement fingerprint to rewrite. For example, to add an index
  hint to the statement `SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE col = 3`, use:
  
  ```
  SELECT crdb_internal.inject_hint(
    'SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE col = _',
    'SELECT * FROM my_table@my_table_col_idx WHERE col = _'
  );
  ```
  
  Whenever a statement is executed matching statement fingerprint `SELECT
  * FROM my_table WHERE col = _`, it will first be rewritten to include
  the injected index hint. [#158096][#158096]
- `ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA` is supported by the declarative schema changer. [#158141][#158141]
- `kv cpu time` is now displayed in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, providing insights into the CPU resources used by KV operations during query execution. [#158499][#158499]
- CockroachDB now negotiates the pgwire protocol version with PostgreSQL 18+ clients that request protocol version 3.2. Previously, connections from these clients would fail with an "unknown protocol version" error. The server now sends a `NegotiateProtocolVersion` message to indicate it supports version 3.0, allowing the connection to proceed normally. [#158636][#158636]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- All queries to system and crdb_internal by
  default will begin failing, notifying users that they must override the
  access gate if they wish to use those namespaces.
  
The `allow_unsafe_internals` setting now defaults to `false`, restricting access to the `system` and `crdb_internal` namespaces. Queries to these namespaces will now fail unless access is manually enabled. Usage is also audited. [#158085][#158085]
- Jobs that are paused due to a specific reason, including jobs which pause themselves when encountering errors such as running out of disk space, now record that reason in their displayed status field of `SHOW JOBS`. [#158350][#158350]
- The following metrics will be marked as essential
  because they are needed for end user troubleshooting:
  - auth.jwt.conn.latency
  - auth.cert.conn.latency
  - auth.password.conn.latency
  - auth.ldap.conn.latency
  - auth.gss.conn.latency
  - auth.scram.conn.latency
  - auth.ldap.conn.latency.internal [#158424][#158424]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The log of messages and events recorded by a job is now shown to non-admin users on the DB Console Jobs page. [#152853][#152853]
- The DB Console now accurately displays **vCPU** counts on the **Overview** page instead of operating system CPU counts. This update uses cgroups to provide a correct vCPU measurement, reflecting reserved compute resources in Kubernetes and other virtualized environments. [#158219][#158219]
- Jobs which are paused for a specific reason now show that reason, and are highlighted in the UI. [#158364][#158364]
- The `kvCPUTimeNanos` is now recorded in `crdb_internal.statement_statistics` and `crdb_internal.transaction_statistics`. In the DB Console, a **KV CPU Time** column is now displayed in the **SQL Activity** > **Statements** and **Transactions** pages, allowing you to monitor and analyze the CPU time consumed by KV operations during query execution. [#158398][#158398]
- The `admissionWaitTime` is now recorded in `crdb_internal.statement_statistics` and `crdb_internal.transaction_statistics`. In the DB Console, an **Admission Wait Time** column is now displayed in the **SQL Activity** > **Statements** and **Transactions** pages. [#158500][#158500]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause an internal error
  in some cases for PL/pgSQL routines that perform database reads within
  an exception block. [#156902][#156902]
- Fixed a bug existing since SQL statements with
  INTO clause were introduced for PL/pgSQL routines in v23.2. The bug could
  cause a SQL statement with side effects (e.g. INSERT) to be dropped if
  none of the target variables from the INTO clause were referenced. [#156966][#156966]
- Fixed a bug where renaming a column that participated in multiple hash-sharded indexes would fail. [#158045][#158045]
- Fixed a bug where `ORDER BY` clauses in user-defined set-returning SQL functions with `OUT` parameters were ignored when the function was called directly in a `SELECT` list (e.g., `SELECT f()`). The ordering is now properly preserved and enforced. [#158162][#158162]
- The pgwire server now exits promptly on context cancellation. [#158269][#158269]
- CockroachDB could previously hit a bounded
  memory leak when collecting table statistics on a table that had both
  very wide (10KiB or more) and relatively small (under 400B) BYTES-like
  values within the same row as well as virtual computed columns. This
  has been present since introduction of stats collection on virtual
  computed columns in 24.1. [#158370][#158370]
- Temporary schema cleanup no longer retries after poisoned transaction errors, reducing log noise. [#158396][#158396]
- When changing the time interval on the **Metrics** page, the DB Console previously sent duplicate requests for metrics data. This has been fixed, and the UI now issues a single, efficient request when updating the time interval. [#158595][#158595]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Add new `update swap` and
  `delete swap` operators which allow some UPDATE and DELETE statements to
  execute in 1 round trip instead of 2 round trips. For now, these
  operators can be used when:
  
  - all columns in the primary index are constrained to a single exact value
    by the WHERE clause;
  - only a single row is modified;
  - there are no FK checks or cascades;
  - there are no uniqueness checks;
  - there are no check constraints;
  - there are no vector indexes modified;
  - there are no passthrough columns to RETURNING;
  - there are no triggers;
  - the table only uses a single column family;
  - there are no mutation columns or mutation indexes (i.e. the table is
    not undergoing an ALTER);
  - there are no columns using composite encoding (e.g. DECIMAL, FLOAT,
    JSON, etc).
  
  We may lift some of these restrictions in future releases. [#145019][#145019]
- The optimizer now collapses
  repeated "%" wildcard characters in LIKE patterns. This may improve
  performance of queries with theses types of LIKE patterns.
