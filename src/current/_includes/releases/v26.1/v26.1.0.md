    <p class="feature-description">
      CockroachDB v26.1 initiates FIPS 140-3 readiness by introducing the Go 1.25 native <a href="https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140">FIPS cryptographic module</a>, replacing OpenSSL for better performance and simpler, kernel-independent deployment. This prepares CockroachDB for the upcoming transition of FIPS 140-2 to Historical status in September 2026. In v26.1, FIPS-ready deployments are in Preview for non-production testing. The final, validation-ready architecture will be available in v26.2, returning the feature to GA status and providing continuous FIPS support for customers who were running v25.4. Production FIPS-ready clusters should continue using v25.4 until v26.2 is released, and then upgrade directly to v26.2.
