<h3 id="v26-1-0-cloudonly-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fix a bug which prevented successfully injecting
  hints using `information_schema.crdb_rewrite_inline_hints` for INSERT,
  UPSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. This bug has existed since hint
  injection was introduced in v26.1.0-alpha.2.
  
  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com> [#161976][#161976]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v26.1.0-beta.1
  in which row-level TTL jobs could encounter GC threshold errors if each
  node had a large number of spans to process. [#161991][#161991]
- Previously, if buffered writes were enabled
  (which is a public preview feature, off by default), multi-stmt explicit
  txns that use SAVEPOINTs to recover from certain errors (like duplicate
  key value violations) could lose the writes that were performed _before_
  the savepoint was created in rare cases. The bug has been present since
  the buffered writes feature was added in 25.2 and is now fixed. [#162032][#162032]
