<h3 id="v26-1-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Removed a `database_name` column from the output of `SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS` that was added in v26.1 development, but will not be needed for v26.1 features. [#158995][#158995]
- Fixed a bug where creating a routine could create unnecessary column dependencies when the routine references columns through CHECK constraints (including those for RLS policies and hash-sharded indexes) or partial index predicates. These unnecessary dependencies prevented dropping the column without first dropping the routine. The fix is gated behind the session setting `use_improved_routine_deps_triggers_and_computed_cols`, which is off by default before v26.1. [#159439][#159439]
- `INSPECT` is now implemented as a generally available (GA) feature with the release of v26.1.0. The `enable_inspect_command` session variable has been deprecated, and is now effectively always set to `true`. [#159750][#159750]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause prepared statements to fail with the error
  message "non-const expression" when they contained filters with stable
  functions. This bug has been present since v25.4.0. [#159203][#159203]
- Fixed a bug where comments associated with constraints were left behind after the column and constraint were dropped. [#159288][#159288]
- Fixed a race condition where queries run after revoking `BYPASSRLS` could return wrong results because cached plans failed to notice the change immediately. [#159380][#159380]
- Fixed a bug where `TRUNCATE` did not behave correctly with respect to the `schema_locked` storage parameter, and was not being blocked when Logical Data Replication (LDR) was in use. This behavior was incorrect and has been fixed. [#159405][#159405]
- Fixed a race condition that could occur during context cancellation of an incoming snapshot. [#159435][#159435]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a panic during changefeed startup if an error occurred while initializing the metrics controller. [#159542][#159542]
- Fixed a memory accounting issue that could occur when a lease expired due to a SQL liveness session-based timeout. [#159625][#159625]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Various background tasks and jobs now more actively yield to foreground work when that work is waiting to run. [#159258][#159258]
