## v26.1.0-alpha.1

Release Date: December 3, 2025

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Docker images now use UBI 10 as the base image. [#153990][#153990]
- The changefeed bulk
  delivery setting was made optional. [#154870][#154870]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Index acceleration is now supported for a subset of `jsonb_path_exists` filters used in the `WHERE` clause.

Given `jsonb_path_exists(json_obj, json_path_expression)`, inverted indexes are supported only when the `json_path_expression` matches one of the following patterns:

- The `json_path_expression` must not be in STRICT mode.
- Keychain mode: `$. [key|wildcard].[key|wildcard]...`. In this mode, a prefix span is generated for the inverted expression.
- Filter with end value mode, using an equality check: `$. [key|wildcard]? (@.[key|wildcard].[key|wildcard]... == [string|number|null|boolean])`. In this mode, since the end value is fixed, a single-value span is generated.

The following cases are not supported:

- `$`
- `$[*]`
- `$.a.b.c == 12`, `$.a.b.c > 12`, or `$.a.b.c < 12` (operation expressions)
- `$.a.b ? (@.a > 10)` (filter with an inequality check) [#150793][#150793]
- A new field is added to SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS.
  database_name gives the name of the database that a db-level changefeed
  is on. For a table-level changefeed, it will be null.
  
  SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS field full_table_names is changed for db-level
  changefeeds. By default, the list of watched tables in full_table_names
  will be empty for a db-level changefeed, giving the total number of
  watched tables. A new option WITH WATCHED_TABLES is added that will make
  SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS return the full list of target tables, like with
  non-db level changefeeds. [#151131][#151131]
- Users can now manually create single-column partial statistics on boolean predicate expressions that can become simple index scans. These statistics can be created by adding a constraining `WHERE` expression to `CREATE STATISTICS`.
  
  For example:
  
  ~~~ sql
  CREATE TABLE t (a INT PRIMARY KEY);
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (5);
  CREATE STATISTICS constrained_stat ON a FROM t WHERE a > 2;
  ~~~ [#152469][#152469]
- Added a clamp for the estimated selectivity of
  inequality predicates that are unbounded on one or both sides (ex: `x > 5`).
  This reduces the chances of a catastrophic understimate causing the optimizer
  to choose a poorly-constrained scan. The new logic is off by default, gated by
  the session setting `optimizer_clamp_inequality_selectivity`. [#153067][#153067]
- Added a clamp for row-count estimates over very
  large tables so that the optimizer assumes that at least one distinct value
  will be scanned. This reduces the chances of a catastrophic underestimate.
  The new logic is off by default, gated by a session setting
  `optimizer_clamp_low_histogram_selectivity`. [#153067][#153067]
- The optimizer can now use table statistics
  that merge the latest full statistic with all newer partial statistics,
  including those over arbitrary constraints over a single span. [#153419][#153419]
- Added the `sql.catalog.allow_leased_descriptors.enabled` cluster setting, which is false by default. When set to true, queries that access the `pg_catalog` or `information_schema` can use cached leased descriptors to populate the data in those tables, with the tradeoff that some of the data could be stale. [#154051][#154051]
- Added a default-off cluster setting
  (`sql.log.scan_row_count_misestimate.enabled`) that enables logging a
  warning on the gateway node when optimizer estimates for scans are
  inaccurate. The log message includes the table and index being scanned,
  the estimated and actual row counts, the time since the last table stats
  collection, and the table's estimated staleness. [#154370][#154370]
- Fixed a bug where the results of `ALTER SEQUENCE`'s increment and `SELECT nextval()` operations were not as expected. The value of a sequence after an `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement has executed on it is now consistent with a sequence created with those values. [#154489][#154489]
- Add changefeed setting
  range_distribution_strategy with values 'default' or 'balanced_simple'
  (e.g. CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR x into 'null://' WITH
  range_distribution_strategy='balanced_simple').
  This new per-changefeed setting will override the cluster setting
  changefeed.default_range_distribution_strategy where both exist. [#154744][#154744]
- Added the `INSPECT` command, which runs consistency validation check jobs against tables or databases and specified indexes. [#154873][#154873]
- Added support for collecting partial
  statistics when the given `WHERE` clause implies the predicate of a
  partial index with the requested column as the first key column. For
  example:
  
  ```
  CREATE TABLE t (a INT, INDEX idx_partial (a) WHERE a > 5);
  CREATE STATISTICS pstat ON a FROM t WHERE a > 7;
  ``` [#154892][#154892]
- The `row_security` session variable now
  behaves like in postgres, allowing users to detect when RLS is applied. [#155110][#155110]
- Added the
  bulkio.index_backfill.vector_merge_batch_size cluster setting to control
  how many vectors to merge into a vector index per transaction during
  create operations. By default, this defaults to 3. [#155284][#155284]
- Changes scan misestimate logging gated behind
  `sql.log.scan_row_count_misestimate.enabled` to use structured logging
  including the table and index being scanned, the estimated and actual
  row counts, the time since the last table stats collection, and the
  table's estimated staleness. [#155454][#155454]
- The `EXPERIMENTAL SCRUB` command is
  deprecated. The `INSPECT` command should be used for data consistency
  validation. [#155485][#155485]
- Vector indexing is now enabled by default. [#155536][#155536]
- `INSPECT` supports a `DETACHED` option to run the operation without waiting for it. [#155774][#155774]
- `ALTER TABLE ... DROP STORED` statements are now executed internally by the declarative schema changer. [#155778][#155778]
- Added sql.statements.rows_read.count metric
  that counts the number of index rows read by SQL statements. [#155820][#155820]
- Added EXPLAIN (FINGERPRINT) statement that
  returns normalized statement fingerprints with constants replaced by
  underscores.

- This release introduces two new settings to
  control the use of canary statistics in query planning:
  1. Cluster setting `sql.stats.canary_fraction` (float, range [0, 1],
     default: 0):
     Controls what fraction of queries use "canary statistics" (newly
     collected stats within their canary window) versus "stable statistics"
     (previously proven stats). For example, a value of 0.2 means 20% of
     queries will use canary stats while 80% use stable stats. The selection
     is atomic per query: if a query is chosen for canary evaluation, it
     uses canary statistics for ALL tables it references (where available).
     A query never uses a mix of canary and stable statistics.
  2. Session variable `canary_stats_mode` (enum: {auto, off, on},
     default: auto):
     - `on`: All queries in the session use canary stats for planning
     - `off`: All queries in the session use stable stats for planning
     - `auto`: The system decides based on `sql.stats.canary_fraction` for
       each query execution [#156307][#156307]
- A new table storage parameter
  `sql_stats_canary_window` has been introduced to enable gradual rollout
  of newly collected table statistics. It takes a duration string as the
  value. When set with a positive duration, the new statistics remain in
  a "canary" state for the specified duration before being promoted to
  stable. This allows for controlled exposure and intervention
  opportunities before statistics are fully deployed across all queries. [#156307][#156307]
- We have introduced the "SHOW FINGERPRINTS FOR
  TABLE" SQL command, which produces a FNV hash of each index a table. FNV
  is used here for performance reasons. [#156600][#156600]
- The `optimizer_clamp_low_histogram_selectivity`
  and `optimizer_clamp_inequality_selectivity` settings are now on by default.
  This will cause the optimizer to assume that at least one distinct value
  "passes" each filter in a query, and that open-ended inequality filters
  select at least 1/10000 rows from the table. This reduces the chances of
  a catastrophic row count underestimate when stats are inaccurate. [#156610][#156610]
- The `ALTER TABLE ... SET/ADD GENERATED AS IDENTITY` statement is supported by the declarative schema changer in v26.1 and later. [#157144][#157144]
- EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE will now display
  the number of hints from `system.statement_hints` applied to the executed
  statement. [#157160][#157160]
- Plan details in the "statement activity" page
  of the DB console now show whether any hints from `system.statement_hints`
  werer applied to the statement execution. [#157160][#157160]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The metrics `sql.select.started.count`, `sql.insert.started.count`, `sql.update.started.count`, and `sql.delete.started.count` are now emitted with labels under the common metric name `sql.started.count`, using a `query_type` label to distinguish each operation. [#151946][#151946]
- Added the cluster setting `storage.unhealthy_write_duration` (defaults to 20s), which is used to indicate to the allocator that a store's disk is unhealthy. The cluster setting `kv.allocator.disk_unhealthy_io_overload_score` controls the overload score assigned to a store with an unhealthy disk, where a higher score results in preventing lease or replica transfers to the store, or shedding of leases by the store. The default value of that setting is 0, so the allocator behavior is unaffected. [#153364][#153364]
- In an upcoming release, we're deprecating the
  bespoke restore and import event logs. For any customer that relies on those
  logs, we can maintain UX parity by plumbing the sql user that owns the
  job to the status change event log. [#153889][#153889]
- Two new changefeed metrics for tracking
  the max skew between a changefeed's slowest and fastest span/table
  have been added. The metrics are gauge metrics with the names
  `changefeed.progress_skew.{span,table}`. [#153975][#153975]
- Added the cluster setting `storage.snapshot.recreate_iter_duration` (default 20s), which controls how frequently a long-lived storage engine iterator, backed by an engine snapshot, will be closed and recreated. Currently, it is only used for iterators used in rangefeed catchup scans. [#154412][#154412]
- Added cluster setting `sql.schema.approx_max_object_count` (default: 20,000) to prevent creation of new schema objects when the limit is exceeded. The check uses cached table statistics for performance and is approximate - it may not be immediately accurate until table statistics are updated by the background statistics refreshing job. Clusters that have been running stably with a larger object count should raise the limit or disable the limit by setting the value to 0. In future releases, the default value for this setting will be raised as more CockroachDB features support larger object counts. [#154495][#154495]
- Cleaned up several
  redundant and misleading metrics. [#154545][#154545]
- Fix changefeed.parallel_io_pending_rows metric
  y-axis label to match the metric's definition. [#154552][#154552]
- Add metric changefeed.parallel_io_workers to
  track the number of workers in ParallelIO. [#154552][#154552]
- This change completes the migration of changfeed events, sample query/txn events, sql_perf events into their respective new logging channels. In order to keep using the old channels, users have to set the setting:
  `log.channel_compatibility_mode.enabled` to true. [#154670][#154670]
- Successfully completed automatic SQL stats collecton jobs are now automatically purged rather than being retained for the full default job retention period. [#155848][#155848]
- The cluster setting `storage.snapshot.recreate_iter_duration` (default `20s`) controls how frequently a long-lived engine iterator, backed by an engine snapshot, will be closed and recreated. Currently, it is only used for iterators used in rangefeed catchup scans. [#156303][#156303]
- ensure the user can run CREATE LOGICAL REPLICATION
  STREAM where the source table has a column with a sequence expression. [#156975][#156975]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- `cockroach workload <name> run` commands now offer
  a `--with-changefeed` flag to additionally run a changefeed watching for
  writes to the workload's tables.

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- SQL dashboard has been extended to include
  more details (mostly about stmts executed within routines and table
  statistics collections). [#155203][#155203]
- The background (elastic) store graphs for exhausted duration, and the wait duration histogram, have been separated from the foreground (regular) graphs. [#156801][#156801]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, CockroachDB would omit execution
  statistics in EXPLAIN ANALYZE output for mutation nodes when a RETURNING
  clause was used. The bug has been present since before v21.1 and is now fixed. [#145934][#145934]
- CockroachDB could previously encounter "vector
  encoder doesn't support ForcePut yet" error when performing COPY command
  concurrently with some schema changes. The bug has been present since
  before 23.2 and is now fixed. [#148549][#148549]
- Fix a bug in which a Read Committed or Snapshot
  isolation transaction may be committed despite returning a non-ambiguous
  error. [#152010][#152010]
- Fixed `IMPORT` progress reporting to show the correct row counts when concurrent job state changes occur. [#152745][#152745]
- A bug in type-checking placeholders with
  `UNKNOWN` types has been fixed. It could cause incorrect results in some
  cases. [#152882][#152882]
- Fixed a bug where `EXPORT CSV` and `EXPORT PARQUET` could cause a node crash when their result rows were used as input to a mutation, such as an `INSERT`, within the same SQL statement. This bug had been present since before v22.1. [#153951][#153951]
- **Idle latency** on the **Transaction Details** page in the DB Console is now reported more accurately. Previously, transactions that used prepared statements (e.g., with placeholders) overcounted idle time, while those that included observer statements (common in the SQL CLI) undercounted it. [#154028][#154028]
- Fixed a bug that caused panics when executing `COPY` into a table with hidden columns and expression indexes. The panic only occurred when the session setting `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` was enabled. This bug was introduced with `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` in v22.1.0. [#154162][#154162]
- Vector index backfill jobs now correctly report progress in the `SHOW JOBS` output. [#154209][#154209]
- Fixed a bug where `RESTORE` of a database with a `SECONDARY REGION` did not apply the lease preferences for that region. [#154522][#154522]
- A bug where a changefeed could perform
  many unnecessary job progress saves during an initial scan has
  been fixed. [#154598][#154598]
- Previously, CockroachDB would not log events for
  TxnRowsRead and TxnRowsWritten guardrail for internal queries into
  SQL_INTERNAL_PERF channel. The bug has been present since 21.2 and
  has now been fixed. [#154670][#154670]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors for `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT .. DO UPDATE` statements when the target table had both a computed column and a `BEFORE` trigger. This bug was present since triggers were introduced in v24.3.0. [#154789][#154789]
- A bug where a changefeed targeting only a subset
  of a table's column families could become stuck has been fixed. [#154802][#154802]
- Previously, CockroachDB would hit an internal
  error when performing an inverted join using an inverted index in which
  the first prefix column had DESC direction. The bug has been present
  since 21.1 and is now fixed. [#154914][#154914]
- Fixed a bug where the `kvflowcontrol.send_queue.scheduled.force_flush` metric was missing a decrement, resulting in a value of greater than `0` even when there was no ongoing force flush. [#154960][#154960]
- Fixed a bug that would cause `WITH READ VIRTUAL CLUSTER` to be ignored if any other options were passed when running `CREATE VIRTUAL CLUSTER FROM REPLICATION`. [#154963][#154963]
- Change assertions about histogram NumRange=0 to
  only be checked in test builds. [#155035][#155035]
- Fix a bug in which range counts in table
  statistics histograms were not handled correctly after a user-defined
  enum type was modified. [#155035][#155035]
- Fixed a bug in the `cockroach node drain` command where draining a node using virtual clusters (such as clusters running Physical Cluster Replication (PCR)) could return before the drain was complete, possibly resulting in shutting down the node while it still had active SQL clients and range leases. [#155063][#155063]
- Fixed a bug where a race condition in range splits could result in a regressed Raft state on a post-split range. This condition was extremely rare, and only observed during internal testing. [#155143][#155143]
- A potential deadlock during vector index
  creation has been corrected. [#155192][#155192]
- Fix a bug that would result in a node crash if a
  PCR or LDR URI used sslinline=true with sslmode=disable. [#155232][#155232]
- Previously, we could corrupt the first bucket of
  table statistic histograms in certain cases, causing underestimates for
  range counts near the lower end of the domain, which is now fixed. [#155242][#155242]
- Added proper dependency handling when adding a constraint with `NOT VALID` that references a user-defined function (UDF). [#155404][#155404]
- A bug has been fixed that prevented the query
  optimizer from recognizing correlated filters when one of the filtered
  columns had a single distinct value across all rows. This bug could
  lead to sub-optimal query plans in some cases. [#155407][#155407]
- The username remapping functionality specified by the `server.identity_map.configuration` cluster setting now matches identities and usernames with a case-insensitive comparison. [#155531][#155531]
- Previously, we could have inconsistencies
  between the forecasted stats shown in `SHOW STATISTICS ... WITH
  FORECAST` and forecasted stats in the stats cache depending on whether
  `WITH MERGE` was also specified. We now correctly display all forecasted
  stats, regardless of `WITH MERGE`. [#155615][#155615]
- Previously, CockroachDB would crash when
  executing EXPLAIN ANALYZE statements with the pausable portal model
  (meaning that it was run via the extended PGWire protocol using Parse,
  Bind, Execute, when `multiple_active_portals_enabled` session variable
  is enabled). The bug has been present since 23.2 and is now fixed. [#155655][#155655]
- `INSPECT` can now be run on tables with indexes that store `REFCURSOR`-typed columns. [#155772][#155772]
- Fixes a bug where `DROP SCHEMA CASCADE` could run into an error with complex references from triggers. [#155777][#155777]
- Fixes a bug where the job responsible for
  compacting stats for the SQL activity state could enter an unschedulable
  state.
  Fixes: #155165 [#155809][#155809]
- Previously, CockroachDB didn't include reads and
  writes performed by routines (user-defined functions and stored
  procedures) as well as apply joins into `bytes read`, `rows read`, and
  `rows written` statement execution statistics, and this is now fixed.
  The bug has been present since before 23.2 version. [#155824][#155824]
- `INSPECT` now correctly checks index consistency at the historical timestamp when using `AS OF SYSTEM TIME`, even for spans with no current data. [#155837][#155837]
- The `INSPECT` statement now detects dangling secondary index entries even when the primary index spans contain no data. [#155844][#155844]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an
  internal error when replacing (via CREATE OR REPLACE stmt)
  a user-defined function or a stored procedure when multiple DEFAULT
  expressions are included in the old signature. The bug has been present
  since v24.2 (when support for DEFAULT expressions was added) and is now
  fixed. [#155867][#155867]
- `INSPECT` no longer fails when checking index consistency on indexes with virtual key columns. Such indexes will now be skipped. [#155956][#155956]
- A bug which could occasionally cause DML on
  regional by row tables with unique indexes that don't reference the
  region to fail under READ-COMMITTED isolation has been corrected. [#156105][#156105]
- Fixed a bug where Zone Config Extensions incorrectly prevented users from removing non-voting read replicas from multi-region databases. Users can now set `num_replicas` equal to `num_voters` to remove read replicas while maintaining the required number of voting replicas for their database's survival goal. This allows reducing storage costs without compromising availability guarantees. [#156228][#156228]
- A bug has been fix with the `ltree2text`
  built-in function in which the returned `TEXT` value was incorrectly
  wrapped with single quotes. This bug has been present since the
  `ltree2text` built-in was introduced in v25.4.0. [#156485][#156485]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect
  results for queries that filter indexed `LTREE` columns with the `<@`
  (contained-by) operator. This bug has been present since v25.4.0.

- Previously, the "atomic" COPY command
  (controlled via `copy_from_atomic_enabled`, which is `true` by default)
  could encounter RETRY_COMMIT_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED txn errors if the whole
  command took 1 minute or more. This was the case only when the
  vectorized engine was used for COPY and is now fixed. [#156584][#156584]
- Fix a bug that could result in a transaction encountering
  the following assertion failure:
  
     failed indeterminate commit recovery: programming error: timestamp change by
     implicitly committed transaction [#156722][#156722]
- Fix JSON path index acceleration with JSON array
  objects. Only 25.4.0 releases are affected. [#156828][#156828]
- Fixed a bug that prevents large `TRUNCATE` operations from completing due to `command is too large` errors. [#156867][#156867]
- Fix bug that could result in incorrect
  gossip.callbacks.pending_duration metric value being recorded. [#156939][#156939]
- Fixed a bug where transactions running concurrently with a `GRANT` or `REVOKE` on virtual tables or via external connections could observe modifications incorrectly. [#156949][#156949]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an
  internal error when evaluating COPY FROM command in a transaction after
  it's been rolled back to a savepoint. The bug has been present since
  before 23.2 version and is now fixed. [#156959][#156959]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause internal
  errors for queries using generic query plans with `NULL` placeholder
  values. [#156962][#156962]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a schema change to be stuck in the reverting state if the `infer_rbr_region_col_using_constraint` storage parameter was being set at the same time as adding a constraint that had a foreign key violation. [#157834][#157834]

<h3 id="v26-1-0-alpha-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The cost of generic query plans
  is now calculated based on worst-case selectivities for placeholder
  equalities (e.g., x = $1). This reduces the chance of suboptimal generic
  query plans being chosen when `plan_cache_mode=auto`. [#151409][#151409]
- TTL jobs now checkpoint their progress, allowing them to resume without reprocessing already completed spans after a restart. [#152618][#152618]
- Queries with filters in the form
  `a LIKE b ESCAPE '\'` are now index-accelerated in some cases which they
  were not before. [#155064][#155064]
- The optimizer chooses suboptimal
  generic query plans in fewer cases. [#155163][#155163]
- Optimized validation queries during `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` to avoid counting the primary key multiple times. [#156889][#156889]
- This commit teaches the
  optimizer to split disjunctions on the same column into unions when
  there are multiple partial indexes with different predicates referencing
  that column. [#157083][#157083]
