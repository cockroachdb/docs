## v21.1.12

Release Date: November 15, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-12-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Added the `--external-io-enable-non-admin-implicit-access` flag to [cluster-starting `cockroach` commands](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cockroach-start). This flag removes the [admin-only](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/authorization#admin-role) restriction on interacting with arbitrary network endpoints and allows implicit authorization for operations such as [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/backup), [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/import), or [`EXPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/export). [#71794][#71794]

<h3 id="v21-1-12-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [`pg_index` table](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/pg-catalog) now populates the `indpred` column for [partial indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/partial-indexes). This column was previously `NULL` for partial indexes. [#70897][#70897]
- Added [`crdb_internal` tables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/crdb-internal) `cross_db_references` and `interleaved` for detecting cross-database references and interleaved objects. [#72298][#72298]
- Statements with multiple [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/insert), [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/upsert), [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/update), or [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/delete) [subqueries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/subqueries) that modify the same table are now disallowed, as these statements can cause data corruption if they modify the same row multiple times. At the risk of data corruption, you can allow these statements by setting the `sql.multiple_modifications_of_table.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cluster-settings) to `true`. To check for corruption, use the `EXPERIMENTAL SCRUB` command. For example: `EXPERIMENTAL SCRUB TABLE t WITH OPTIONS INDEX ALL;`. [#71621][#71621]

<h3 id="v21-1-12-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- `IMPORT` now allows non-admin access to some previously-restricted network endpoints on clusters started with the `--external-io-enable-non-admin-implicit-access` flag. [#72444][#72444]
- A new implementation of `BACKUP` file handling is now available with the [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cluster-settings) `bulkio.backup.experimental_21_2_mode.enabled` set to `true`. [#71830][#71830]

<h3 id="v21-1-12-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Non-admin users of the DB Console now have the ability to view the [Cluster Overview page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-cluster-overview-page). Users without the [admin role](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/authorization#admin-role) can see data about their nodes, but information such as command line arguments, environment variables, and node IP addresses and DNS names is hidden. [#71719][#71719]
- Replicas waiting for garbage collection were preventing the [Range Report page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-debug-pages) from loading due to a JavaScript error. The page now loads and displays an empty "Replica Type" while in this state. [#71745][#71745]

<h3 id="v21-1-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to encounter an internal error when executing a [zigzag join](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/experimental-features) in some cases. [#71255][#71255]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to incorrectly read the data of a [unique secondary index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/unique) that used to be a primary index that was created via `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` in 21.1.x or prior versions. [#71587][#71587]
- CockroachDB now avoids dialing nodes in performance-critical code paths, which could cause substantial latency when encountering unresponsive nodes (e.g., when a VM or server is shut down). [#70488][#70488]
- Fixed a bug causing the [TPC-C workload](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cockroach-workload) to improperly assign workers to the local partitions in a [multi-region setup](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/multiregion-overview). [#71753][#71753]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors when collecting statistics on tables with virtual [computed columns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/computed-columns). [#71284][#71284]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to crash when network connectivity was impaired in some cases. The stack trace (in [`cockroach-stderr.log`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/logging)) would contain `server.(*statusServer).NodesUI`. [#71719][#71719]
- Fixed a panic that could occur with invalid GeoJSON input using [`ST_GeomFromGeoJSON/ST_GeogFromGeoJSON`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/functions-and-operators). [#71308][#71308]
- Fixed a bug causing cluster [backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/backup) to back up opt-out system tables unexpectedly. [#71922][#71922]
- Fixed a bug that caused [`ALTER COLUMN TYPE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/alter-column) statements to fail unexpectedly. [#71166][#71166]
- Connection timeout for `grpc` connections is now set to `20s` to match the pre-20.2 default value. [#71516][#71516]
- Fixed a bug that prevented the rollback of [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/alter-primary-key) when the old primary key was interleaved. [#71852][#71852]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results for some queries that utilized a [zigzag join](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/experimental-features). The bug could only reproduce on tables with at least two multi-column indexes with nullable columns. The bug was present since version 19.2.0. [#71847][#71847]
- Fixed a bug causing `IMPORT` statements to incorrectly reset progress upon resumption. [#72086][#72086]
- Fixed a bug causing schema changes running during node shutdown to fail permanently. [#71558][#71558]
- Fixed an incorrect "no data source matches prefix" error for queries that use a set-returning function on the right-hand side of a [`JOIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/joins) (unless `LATERAL` is explicitly specified). [#71443][#71443]
- Long running [`ANALYZE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/explain-analyze) statements no longer result in GC TTL errors. [#69599][#69599]
- `IMPORT INTO` no longer crashes when encountering unresolved write intents. [#71982][#71982]
- Fixed a bug causing tracing to external tracers to inadvertently stop after the Enqueue Range or the Allocator [debug pages](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-debug-pages) were used. [#72463][#72463]
- Fixed a bug which prevented the Data Distribution debug page from working on clusters which were upgraded from 19.2 or earlier. [#72507][#72507]

<h3 id="v21-1-12-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Slightly reduced `ANALYZE` and [`CREATE STATISTICS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-statistics) statements memory usage. [#71771][#71771]
- To reduce transient memory usage, CockroachDB now performs intent cleanup during garbage collection in batches as they are found instead of performing a single cleanup at the end of the garbage collection cycle. [#67590][#67590]
