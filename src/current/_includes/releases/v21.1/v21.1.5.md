- Fixed a panic that could occur in the [optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cost-based-optimizer) when executing a prepared plan with placeholders. This could happen when one of the tables used by the query had [computed columns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/computed-columns) or a [partial index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/partial-indexes).
