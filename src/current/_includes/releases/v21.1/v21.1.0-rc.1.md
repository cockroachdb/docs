<h3 id="v21-1-0-rc-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- CockroachDB no longer allows [`ADD REGION`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/add-region) or `DROP REGION` statements if a [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/multiregion-overview) table has index changes underway, or if a table is transitioning to or from `REGIONAL BY ROW`. [#64255][#64255] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now prevents index modification on `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables and locality to or from `REGIONAL BY ROW` changes while an `ADD REGION` or `DROP REGION` statement is being executed. [#64255][#64255] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a scenario in which a rapid sequence of [range splits](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/architecture/distribution-layer#range-splits) could trigger a storm of [Raft snapshots](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/architecture/replication-layer#snapshots). This would be accompanied by log messages of the form "would have dropped incoming MsgApp, but allowing due to ..." and tended to occur as part of [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/restore)/[`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/import) operations. [#64202][#64202]
- Read-write contention on [`GLOBAL` tables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/multiregion-overview) no longer has a potential to thrash without making progress. [#64215][#64215]
- Previously, if a [`DROP INDEX`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/drop-index) failed during a `REGIONAL BY ROW` transition, the index could have been re-inserted back into the `REGIONAL BY ROW` table but would be invalid if it was [hash-sharded](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/hash-sharded-indexes) or [partitioned](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/multiregion-overview). This bug is now fixed. [#64255][#64255]
- Fixed a rare bug present in [v21.1 beta versions]({% link releases/index.md %}#testing-releases) that could cause rapid range splits and merges on a `GLOBAL` table to lead to a stuck leaseholder replica. The situation is no longer possible. [#64304][#64304]
- Fixed a bug in previous v21.1 beta versions that allowed the store rebalancer to spuriously down-replicate a range during normal operation. [#64303][#64303]
- CockroachDB now prevents some out-of-memory conditions caused by [schema change](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/online-schema-changes) validations concurrent with other high-memory-use queries. [#64307][#64307]
- Fixed a bug present since [v21.1.0-alpha.1](#v21-1-0-alpha-1) that could cause cascading [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/delete)s with [subqueries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/subqueries) to error. [#64278][#64278]
- Fixed a bug that caused store information to be incorrectly redacted from the [CockroachDB logs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/logging-overview), when logging was configured with redaction. [#64338][#64338]
- Previously, the remote flows of execution in the [vectorized engine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/vectorized-execution) could take a long time to shut down if a node participating in the plan died. This bug is now fixed. [#64219][#64219]
