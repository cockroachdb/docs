<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

<h4 id="v21-1-0-beta-2-multi-region-changes">Multi-region changes</h4>

- Added validation that prevents users from updating the [zone configurations](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) of [multi-region tables](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) without first setting the `override_multi_region_zone_config` [session variable](../v21.1/set-vars.html). [#62119][#62119]
- Discarding a zone configuration from a multi-region enabled entity is blocked behind the `override_multi_region_zone_config` [session variable](../v21.1/set-vars.html). [#62159][#62159]
- Reverted the change that added the `FORCE` keyword in [#61499][#61499] in favor of the `override_multi_region_zone_config` session variable.  [#62119][#62119]
- Setting non-[multi-region](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) controlled fields on [zone configs](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) before `ALTER DATABASE ... SET PRIMARY REGION` will now be preserved and have the same value after the `SET PRIMARY REGION` command is issued. [#62162][#62162]
- [Materialized views](../v21.1/views.html#materialized-views) in multi-region databases will now have a [`GLOBAL` table locality](../v21.1/set-locality.html#set-the-table-locality-to-global). [#62194][#62194]
- [Materialized views](../v21.1/views.html#materialized-views) which are in a database before the first [`ADD REGION`](../v21.1/add-region.html) will become [`GLOBAL`](../v21.1/set-locality.html#set-the-table-locality-to-global) on `ADD REGION`, in line with the behavior of `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` on a [multi-region](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) database. [#62194][#62194]
- `ALTER DATABASE .. SET PRIMARY REGION` now requires both `CREATE` and `ZONECONFIG` privilege on all objects inside the database when [adding the first region to the database](../v21.1/add-region.html#examples). The same behavior applies for dropping the last region using `ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION`. [#62450][#62450]
- Removed the experimental multi-region locality syntaxes. [#62114][#62114]

<h4 id="v21-1-0-beta-2-general-changes">General changes</h4>

- CockroachDB now stores information about contention on non-SQL keys. [#62041][#62041]
- Statement [diagnostics bundles](../v21.1/explain-analyze.html#debug-option) now contain output of `EXPLAIN (VEC)` and `EXPLAIN (VEC, VERBOSE)` commands for the statements. [#62049][#62049]
- Sampled execution stats are now available through [`crdb_internal.node_{statement,transaction}_statistics`](../v21.1/crdb-internal.html). [#62089][#62089]
- Increased the default value for the `sql.txn_stats.sample_rate` [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) from 0 to 0.1. This means that from now on every statement has 10% probability of being sampled for the purposes of execution statistics. Note that no other criteria for sampling (such as query latency) are currently being utilized to decide whether to sample a statement or not. [#61815][#61815]
- Added the following [cluster settings](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html): `sql.defaults.statement_timeout`, which controls the default value for the `statement_timeout` [session setting](../v21.1/set-vars.html); `sql.defaults.idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, which controls the default value for the `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` timeout setting; `sql.defaults.idle_in_session_timeout`, which already existed, but is now a public cluster setting. [#62182][#62182]
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v21.1/explain.html) and [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.1/explain-analyze.html) now show how long ago [table statistics](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) were collected. [#61945][#61945]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-2-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Changed the formatting of namespace validation failures in `cockroach debug doctor` output. [#62245][#62245]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where the `target` column of `crdb_internal.zones` would show names without properly accounting for user-defined schemas. [#62022][#62022]
- Added validation that prevents regions being dropped on [multi-region databases](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) when there are <= 3 regions left on the database. [#62162][#62162]
- Fixed a bug where [zone configurations](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) were not being correctly dropped on the final `DROP REGION` of a multi-region database. [#62162][#62162]
- Fixed a bug where [`VIEW`s](../v21.1/views.html) and [`SEQUENCE`s](../v21.1/create-sequence.html) were not being allowed in multi-region databases. They will now default to the [`REGIONAL BY TABLE`](../v21.1/set-locality.html#set-the-table-locality-to-regional-by-table) locality. [#62176][#62176]
- Fixed a bug where the `pg_type_is_visible` built-in function did not correctly handle user-defined types. [#62225][#62225]
- Fixed a bug where casting an `OID` to a `regtype` did not work for user-defined types. [#62225][#62225]
- A Raft leader who loses quorum will now relinquish its range lease and remove the replica if the range is recreated elsewhere, e.g., via `Node.ResetQuorum()`. [#62103][#62103]
- Fixed a bug where `ClearRange` could leave behind stray write intents when separated intents were enabled, which could cause subsequent storage errors. [#62104][#62104]
- [`ALTER TABLE`](../v21.1/alter-table.html), [`ALTER VIEW`](../v21.1/alter-view.html), and [`ALTER SEQUENCE`](../v21.1/alter-sequence.html) can no longer be used to incorrectly create cross-DB references. [#62341][#62341]
- Disallowed adding columns of type `OIDVECTOR` or `INT2VECTOR` to a table in [`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`](../v21.1/add-column.html) statements. These types are not allowed in user-created tables via [`CREATE TABLE`](../v21.1/create-table.html) and were previously erroneously allowed in `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`. [#62180][#62180]
- CockroachDB now logs all unsupported `pgdump` statements across smaller log files that can be found in the subdirectory `import<jobID>/(unsupported_schema_stmts|unsupported_data_stmts)/<filenum>.log` [#62263][#62263]
- Fixed a bug where a [constraint](../v21.1/constraints.html) like `NOT NULL` or `CHECK` on a column made irrelevant by a [`DROP CONSTRAINT`](../v21.1/drop-constraint.html) statement in a later concurrent transaction would lead to errors / incorrect behaviour. [#62249][#62249]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur when [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v21.1/set-locality.html) tables were joined with other tables using a lookup or inverted join. The internal error was `"we expect that limited UNION ALL queries are only planned locally"`. [#62383][#62383]
- Fixed a bug where using `DROP REGION` on the last region of a multi-region database would not delete the global [zone configurations](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) for [`GLOBAL` tables](../v21.1/set-locality.html#set-the-table-locality-to-global). [#62220][#62220]
- Fixed a bug where duplicate [`IMPORT`](../v21.1/import.html) job records may have been created, or `IMPORT` statements may have failed, when the actual job succeeded. [#62396][#62396]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could collect execution statistics prematurely, which would result in incorrect stats (e.g., when running [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.1/explain-analyze.html)). [#62384][#62384]
- Fixed a bug where setting the `kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration` to 0 did not disable routing requests to [follower replicas](../v21.1/follower-reads.html). [#62439][#62439]
- Fixed a bug where a failed [restore from a backup](../v21.1/restore.html) including [user defined types](../v21.1/create-type.html) would require manual cleanup. [#62454][#62454]
