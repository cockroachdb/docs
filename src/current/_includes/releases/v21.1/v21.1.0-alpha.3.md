## v21.1.0-alpha.3

Release Date: February 8, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Added ability to further debug connections shut down automatically by the server. [#59460][#59460]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed up [`ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE`](../v21.1/add-constraint.html) to partition correctly under a [`PARTITION ALL BY`](../v21.1/partition-by.html) table. [#59364][#59364]
- CockroachDB now applies zone configs to new [unique constraints](../v21.1/unique.html) in `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables. [#59364][#59364]
- A new, unused field called `global_reads` was added to [zone configurations](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html). The field does not yet have any effect. [#59304][#59304]
- A new [private cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) `sql.distsql.temp_storage.hash_agg.enabled` was added that allows users to disable the disk spilling capability of the hash aggregation in the [vectorized execution engine](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html). It is `true` by default which incurs some performance hit. Setting it to `false` will improve the performance, but the queries might hit an out-of-memory limit error. [#59414][#59414]
- The optimizer now enforces a unique constraint on the explicit index columns for implicitly partitioned unique indexes and unique indexes in [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v21.1/create-table.html). An attempt to insert or update a row such that the unique constraint is violated will result in an error. [#59501][#59501]
- [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v21.1/create-table.html) now preserve [zone configurations](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) when using [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v21.1/alter-primary-key.html). [#59365][#59365]
- Implemented [`ALTER TABLE ... LOCALITY REGIONAL BY TABLE`](../v21.1/alter-table.html) from `LOCALITY GLOBAL`. [#59407][#59407]
- [Zone configs](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) now support new attributes `num_voters` and `voter_constraints`. `num_voters` will specify the number of [voting replicas](../v21.1/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html#consensus). When `num_voters` is explicitly specified, `num_replicas` will be the sum of voting and non-voting replicas. `voter_constraints` will specify the constraints that govern the placement of just the voting replicas, whereas the existing `constraints` attributes will govern the placement of all replicas (voting as well as non-voting). [#57184][#57184]
- Added SQL syntax for [`RESTORE tenant x FROM REPLICATION STREAM FROM 'replication_stream'`](../v21.1/restore.html). This allows the user to start an ingestion job to ingest KVs from the replication stream into the destination tenant's keyspace. [#59112][#59112]
- The [`SHOW CREATE`](../v21.1/show-create.html) statement now lists [`ALTER PARTITION`](../v21.1/alter-partition.html) statements sorted by the partition name and index_name. [#59580][#59580]
- Error messages for cross-database links now include a hint directing to the user to the [deprecation docs](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html). An example message looks like:  ``` ERROR: the view cannot refer to other databases; (see the 'sql.cross_db_views.enabled' cluster setting) SQLSTATE: 0A000 HINT: Note that cross database references will be removed in future releases. See: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v21.1.html#v21-1-0-deprecations ``` [#59551][#59551]
- The `escape_string_warning` session variable from PostgreSQL was added with [compatibility-only](../v21.1/postgresql-compatibility.html) support. It defaults to `on` and cannot be changed. [#59479][#59479]
- Multi-column [GIN indexes](../v21.1/create-index.html#create-gin-indexes) can now be created. The last indexed column must be inverted types such as [`JSON`](../v21.1/jsonb.html), [`ARRAY`](../v21.1/array.html), [`GEOMETRY`, and `GEOGRAPHY`](../v21.1/spatial-data.html). All preceding columns must have types that are indexable. These indexes may be used for queries that constrain all index columns. [#59565][#59565]
- Added `WITH full_table_name` option to create a changefeed on `movr.public.drivers` instead of `drivers`. [#59258][#59258]
- [`UPSERT`s](../v21.1/upsert.html) on tables with an implicitly partitioned primary index now use only the explicit primary key columns as the conflict columns, excluding all implicit partitioning columns. This also applies to `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables, ensuring that the `crdb_region` column is not included in the `UPSERT` key. [#59654][#59654]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach`](../v21.1/cockroach-commands.html) command now supports the command-line parameter `--version` which reports its version parameters. This makes `cockroach --version` equivalent to `cockroach version`. [#58665][#58665]
- The [`cockroach version`](../v21.1/cockroach-version.html) command now supports a new parameter `--build-tag`; when specified, it displays the technical build tag, which makes it possible to integrate with automated deployment tools. [#58665][#58665]
- The `channels` parameter for the log sink [configurations](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/generated/logsinks.md) now supports a more flexible input configuration format:  
    Syntax to include specific channels:   
    `channels: dev,sessions`  (yaml string)   
    `channels: 'dev,sessions'` (yaml string, equivalent to previous)   
    `channels: [dev,sessions]` (yaml array, can use multi-line syntax with hyphens too)   
    `channels: ['dev','sessions']` (same as previous)   
    `channels: '[dev,sessions]'` (bracket-enclosed list inside yaml string)   

    Syntax to include all channels:  
    `channels: all` (yaml string)   
    `channels: 'all'` (same as previous)   
    `channels: [all]` (yaml array)   
    `channels: ['all']` (same as previous)   
    `channels: '[all]'` (bracket-enclosed "all" inside yaml string)   

    Syntax to include all channels except some:  
    `channels: all except dev,sessions` (yaml string)   
    `channels: 'all except dev,sessions'`  (same as previous, quoted string)   
    `channels: 'all except [dev,sessions]'` (same as previous, list is bracket enclosed)  

    For example:  ``` sinks:   stderr:     channels:     - DEV     - SQL_SESSIONS ```  uses the "native" YAML syntax for lists. [#59352][#59352]

- The notification that `SIGHUP` was received, and that log files are flushed to disk as a result, is now sent to the [OPS logging channel](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/generated/logging.md#ops). [#59345][#59345]
- The notification that `SIGHUP` was received, and that TLS certificates are reloaded from disk as a result, is now sent to the OPS logging channel as a structured event. Refer to the [reference docs](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/generated/logformats.md) for details about the event payload. [#59345][#59345]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-api-endpoint-changes">API endpoint changes</h3>

- Added a new API tree, in `/api/v2/*`, currently undocumented, that avoids the use of cookie-based authentication in favor of sessions in headers, and support for pagination. [#58436][#58436]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Updated the [table details page](../v21.1/ui-databases-page.html#table-details) to show table-specific zone configuration values when set, show constraints and lease preferences, and display a valid statement to re-configure zone configuration for that table. [#59196][#59196]
- Users can now see the time series of full table or index scans in the [Advanced Debug page](../v21.1/ui-debug-pages.html). [#59261][#59261]
- The `sql.leases.active` gauge is now available to track the outstanding descriptor leases in the [cluster](../v21.1/ui-cluster-overview-page.html). [#57561][#57561]
- Long queries are truncated in the DB Console. [#59603][#59603]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Added event logs for [`SET SCHEMA`](../v21.1/set-schema.html) statements. [#58737][#58737]
- Fixed an issue where a [left inverted join](../v21.1/joins.html) could have incorrect results. In particular, some output rows could have non-`NULL` values for right-side columns when the right-side columns should have been `NULL`. This issue has only existed in alpha releases of 21.1 so far, and it is now fixed. [#59279][#59279]
- Fixed a panic where type hints mismatching placeholder names cause a crash. [#59450][#59450]
- Unexpected internal errors containing stack traces that reference a `countingWriter` null pointer have now been fixed. [#59477][#59477]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.1 in the DB Console where incorrect zone configuration values were shown on the table details page and constraints and lease preferences were not displayed. [#59196][#59196]
- [Changefeeds](../v21.1/create-changefeed.html) no longer error with "1e2 is not roundtrippable at scale 2" when 100 is stored in a column with width 2. [#59075][#59075]
- Fixed a bug which prevented [renaming a column](../v21.1/rename-column.html) that was referenced earlier in a transaction as part of a computed expression, index predicate, check expression, or not null constraint. [#59384][#59384]
- Added event logs for privilege changes in `crdb_internal.unsafe_xxx`. [#59282][#59282]
- Fixed a bug in which incorrect results could be returned for [left and anti joins](../v21.1/joins.html). This could happen when one of the columns on one side of the join was constrained to multiple constant values, either due to a check constraint or an `IN` clause. The bug resulted in non-matching input rows getting returned multiple times in the output, which is incorrect. This bug only affected previous alpha releases of 21.1, and has now been fixed. [#59646][#59646]
- Fixed [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`](../v21.1/explain-analyze.html) interaction with the SQL shell. [#59557][#59557]
- Fixed a bug preventing [foreign key constraints](../v21.1/foreign-key.html) referencing hidden columns (e.g., `rowid`) from being added. [#59659][#59659]
- Fixed a bug where [`DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`](../v21.1/drop-schema.html) could result in types which are referenced being dropped. [#59281][#59281]
- Fixed a bug whereby [dropping a schema](../v21.1/drop-schema.html) with a table that used a [user-defined type](../v21.1/create-type.html) which was not being dropped (because it is in a different schema) would result in a descriptor corruption due to a dangling back-reference to a dropped table on the type descriptor. [#59281][#59281]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-alpha-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The [query optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) now plans scans over GIN indexes on [`JSON`](../v21.1/jsonb.html) columns for query filters that constrain the `JSON` column with equality and fetch value operators (`->`) inside conjunctions and disjunctions, like `j->'a' = '1' AND j->'b' = '2'`. [#59266][#59266]
- Fixed a bug included in 20.2.1 for the [`JSON`](../v21.1/jsonb.html) fetch value operator, `->` which resulted in chained `->` operators in query filters not being index accelerated (e.g., `j->'a'->'b' = '1'`). Chained `->` operators are now index accelerated. [#59494][#59494]
- Improved the allocation performance of workloads that use the [`EXTRACT`](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html) built-in. [#59598][#59598]
