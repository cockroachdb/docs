Release Date: June 7, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-2-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Added [multi-region workloads](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/movr-flask-overview) for `cockroach demo movr --geo-partitioned-replicas`. Setting `--multi-region` enables for multi-region workloads, and setting `--survive` allows for surviving `AZ` or `REGION` failures. Setting `--infer-crdb-region-column` also infers the `crdb_region` for `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables. [#65642][#65642] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [Changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-changefeed) now better handle slow or unavailable sinks by treating "memory exceeded" errors as retryable. [#65387][#65387] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `crdb_internal.lost_descriptors_with_data` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/functions-and-operators) to show descriptors that have no entries but data left behind. [#65462][#65462] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `crdb_internal.force_delete_table_data` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/functions-and-operators) which allows table data to be cleaned up only using a descriptor ID for cases of table descriptor corruption. [#65462][#65462] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The statement type ("tag") is now also included alongside the full text of the SQL query in the various structured log entries produced when query execution is being [logged](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/logging-overview). [#65554][#65554] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now returns a SQL Notice if a [`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-table) command is used to create a `TABLE` and the `TABLE` already exists. [#65636][#65636] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `SHOW FULL TABLE SCANS` statement was added to CockroachDB. [#65671][#65671] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now returns a SQL Notice if a [`CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-type) command is used to create a type and the type already exists. [#65635][#65635] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added a `chunk_size` option to [`EXPORT INTO CSV`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/export) to control the target CSV file size. [#65388][#65388] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- SQL stats can now be cleared using the `crdb_internal.reset_sql_stats()` function. [#65674][#65674] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now supports [`ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION IF NOT EXISTS ...`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/add-region) which does not cause an error when adding a region that is already in the database. [#65752][#65752] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now outputs a clearer error message when running [`ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION ...`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/add-region) if the region is an undefined region. Previously, the error message for not having a region defined on a database resulted in an error about enums. [#65752][#65752] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the [`ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION IF EXISTS ...`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/drop-region) statement syntax, which does not error if dropping a region that is not defined on the database. [#65752][#65752] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed a bug where transitioning from locality `REGIONAL BY ROW` to `GLOBAL` or `REGIONAL BY TABLE` could mistakenly remove a zone configuration on an index which has no multi-region fields set. [#65833][#65833] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now only blocks a [zone configuration DISCARD](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/configure-zone) on a multi-region table, index, or partition if the multi-region abstractions created the zone configuration. [#65834][#65834] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- [Range metrics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-replication-dashboard) are now gathered from the leaseholder (if live) rather than the first available range replica. This avoids scenarios where a stale replica may yield incorrect metrics, in particular over/underreplication markers. [#64590][#64590] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed [Jobs page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-jobs-page) crash while using pagination and improved its performance. [#65723][#65723]
- Fixed a typo on the Network tooltip on the [Statements page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-statements-page). [#65605][#65605]
- Fixed a missing node ID in the rejoin [event message](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/ui-runtime-dashboard#events-panel) [#65806][#65806]
- Sorts on tables now pick up the correct value from the URL. [#65605][#65605]

<h3 id="v21-1-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where a certain percentage of cases in which a node could have served a [follower read](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/follower-reads) were not handled correctly, resulting in the node routing the request to another nearby node for no reason. [#65471][#65471]
- The [`has_database_privilege`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/functions-and-operators) function now correctly will check privileges on databases that are not the current database being used by the session. [#65534][#65534]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would previously crash when attempting to create a table using [`CREATE TABLE ... AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-table-as) syntax where the `AS` clause selects from `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics`, `crdb_internal.node_transaction_statistics`, or `crdb_internal.node_txn_stats` virtual tables. [#65542][#65542]
- Fixed a bug which allowed [index definitions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/indexes) with redundant columns, which led to unnecessary storage usage. This bug can notably manifest itself with [`ALTER TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/alter-table) statements which alter the primary index on a partitioned table. This bug has been present for a long time in theory, but in practice would only appear in CockroachDB since version 21.1.0. [#65482][#65482]
- Fixed a bug where binary [`TIMETZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/time) values were not being decoded correctly when being sent as a parameter in the wire protocol. [#65341][#65341]
- Fixed a race condition during transaction cleanup that could leave old transaction records behind until [MVCC garbage collection](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/architecture/storage-layer#mvcc). [#65383][#65383]
- Improved [transaction cleanup](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/architecture/transaction-layer) for disconnected clients, to reduce intent buildup. [#65383][#65383]
- Added the ability to change the `COMMENT` on a column after using [`ALTER TYPE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/alter-type) on that column. [#65698][#65698]
- [Scheduled backup](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-schedule-for-backup) with [interleaved tables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/interleave-in-parent) can now be created with the `include_deprecated_interleaves` option. [#65731][#65731]
- Fixed a bug where `ST_Node` on a [`LINESTRING`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/linestring) with the same repeated points results in an error. [#65700][#65700]
- Calling [`get_bit` or `set_bit`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/functions-and-operators) on a byte array argument now goes to the correct index of the underlying bit string, in order to match the behavior of Postgres. [#65786][#65786]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER DATABASE ... CONVERT TO SCHEMA`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/convert-to-schema) could potentially leave the schema with invalid privileges thus causing the privilege descriptor to be invalid. [#65810][#65810]
- CockroachDB now renders the `CACHE` clause for [sequences](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/create-sequence) which use a cache. [#65805][#65805]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a node to crash in rare cases if a [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/backup) writing to Google Cloud Storage failed. [#65802][#65802]
- Fixed a bug introduced in 21.1 where [cluster restores](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/restore) would report inaccurate progress, showing 100% progress erroneously. [#65803][#65803]
- Fixed a crash when performing a cluster [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/backup) with revision history of a cluster upgraded from 20.1 to 20.2 to 21.1 which contains tables that were truncated by 20.1. [#65860][#65860]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results for queries where [`CHAR` and `VARCHAR`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/string#related-types) columns are filtered by constant string values. The bug was present since version v21.1.0. [#66101][#66101]

<h3 id="v21-1-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The [optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cost-based-optimizer) can now avoid full table scans for queries with a [`LIMIT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/limit-offset) and [`ORDER BY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/order-by) clause in some additional cases where the `ORDER BY` columns are not a prefix of an index. [#65392][#65392]
- The [optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/cost-based-optimizer) now generates query plans that scan indexes on virtual collated string columns, regardless of the casing or formatting of the collated locale in the query. [#65531][#65531]
- CockroachDB now reduces the number of round-trips required to call `pg_table_is_visible` in the context of [`pg_catalog` queries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.1/pg-catalog). [#65807][#65807]
