<h3> General changes </h3>

- The following new regions are now available for all {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters:

    GCP                                          | AWS
    ---------------------------------------------|------
    Frankfurt, Germany (`europe-west3`)          | Osaka, Japan (`ap-northeast-3`)
                                                 | Montréal, Québec (`ca-central-1`)
                                                 | Stockholm, Sweden (`eu-north-1`)

<h3> Console changes </h3>

- Added an icon next to a cluster's name on the [**Billing overview**](../cockroachcloud/billing-management.html) page to indicate when a cluster has been deleted.
- The [**Database page**](../cockroachcloud/databases-page.html) in the {{ site.data.products.db }} Console now shows the last time table statistics were updated.
- All new AWS clusters now use [`gp3` volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/general-purpose.html). Previously created AWS clusters still use `io1` volumes. AWS `gp3` volumes expose three parameters: storage amount, IOPS, and throughput.

<h3> Cloud API changes </h3>

- The [Cloud API](../api/cloud/v1.html) documentation now indicates which endpoints are in preview.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- The **Sessions** link on the [**Overview**](../cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page.html) page now redirects to the correct tab on the [**SQL Activity**](../cockroachcloud/sessions-page.html) page.
- Fixed a bug where stale data caused **Connect** modal errors immediately after creating a {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster.
- Fixed a bug where backup metadata payloads were limited to 4MiB instead of the desired 32MiB.
- Fixed a bug where the node-aggregated low disk alert was not firing.
