<h3> Console changes </h3>

- Invoice customers with Premium Support will now see Preimum Support included on their [invoices](../cockroachcloud/billing-management.html).
- Cross-cluster [restores](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html#restore-a-cluster) are now limited to {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters with a major version greater than or equal to the major version of the source cluster.
- The [**Restore jobs**](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html#restore-a-cluster) tab of the **Backups page** now shows more information about the restore job, such as the source and destination clusters, the restore type, the backup size, and the job progress.

<h3> Security updates </h3>

- The [Organization Audit Logs API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-audit-logs.html), which provides logs for different types of events occurring in a Cloud organization, is now [generally available](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability.html#feature-availability-phases).
- `ExternalId` support is now re-enabled in the [Customer-managed Encryption Key (CMEK)](../cockroachcloud/cmek-ops-aws.html) capability on AWS.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- The `status` returned by the `logexport` [Cloud API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html) endpoint is now determined by the readiness of the underlying logging resources, in addition to the latest log export update job state. Before this change, it was possible for `GET` requests to the `logexport` to report a log export status that conflicted with the latest log export update job state or with the state of the logging infrastructure.
- Fixed a bug where concurrent [restores](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html#restore-a-cluster) could run on the same destination cluster.
- Fixed a bug where the IOPS price preview shown when [creating](../cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.html) or [editing a cluster](../cockroachcloud/cluster-management.html) was inaccurate.
- The **Group** tab is now only shown to users who have access to it.
