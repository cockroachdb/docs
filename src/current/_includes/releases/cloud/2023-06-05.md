<h3> Console changes </h3>

- Organizations that have purchased premium support will now see it included in their [invoices](../cockroachcloud/billing-management.html).
- Cross-cluster [restores](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html#restore-a-cluster) are now limited to {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters with a major version greater than or equal to the major version of the source cluster.
- The [**Restore jobs**](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html#restore-a-cluster) tab of the **Backups page** now shows more information about a restore job, such as the source and destination clusters, the restore type, the backup size, and the job's progress.

<h3> Security updates </h3>

- The [Organization Audit Logs API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-audit-logs.html), which provides logs of events that occur in a Cloud organization, is now [generally available](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability.html#feature-availability-phases).
- `ExternalId` support is now re-enabled in the [Customer-managed Encryption Key (CMEK)](../cockroachcloud/cmek-ops-aws.html) capability on AWS.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- The `status` returned by the [`logexport` Cloud API endpoint](../cockroachcloud/export-logs.html#the-logexport-endpoint) is now determined by the state of both the latest log export's job state and the readiness of the underlying logging resources. Before this change, a `GET` request to the `logexport` endpoint could report an outdated log export status that conflicted with the latest log export update job state or with the most recent state of the logging infrastructure.
- Fixed a bug where concurrent [restores](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html#restore-a-cluster) could run on the same destination cluster and cause the destination cluster to become unusable.
- Fixed a bug where the IOPS price preview shown when [creating](../cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.html) or [editing a cluster](../cockroachcloud/cluster-management.html) was inaccurate.
- The **Group** tab is now shown only to users who have this feature enabled. Previously, an error page was shown to users who navigated to the **Group** tab without enabling the feature.
