<h3> General changes </h3>

- Previously, a default setting in the Amazon CloudWatch exporter could cause redundant cardinality in [metrics exported](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/export-metrics) from CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters, which unnecessarily increased costs. This option is now disabled to reduce AWS costs.
  
<h3> Console changes </h3>

- The **Add database** button on the [**Databases** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/databases-page) of the Console is temporarily disabled.
- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} [restore jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups?filters=dedicated#ways-to-restore-data) now have the following more descriptive statuses: `Preparing`, `Running`, `Reverting`, `Finalizing`, `Succeeded`, and `Failed` statuses. Additionally, destination clusters of self-service restores now display a `Restoring` state during the restore.
- The [**Databases** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/databases-page) now includes additional statistics for clusters running [v23.1.0]({% link releases/v23.1.md %}) and later.
- You can now set up an AWS CloudWatch integration and view its status directly from the [**Tools** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/tools-page) of the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console.

<h3> Security updates </h3>

- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} users can now [configure an IP allowlist](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/network-authorization#ip-allowlisting) with up to 50 allowlist rules for their clusters.
- The following [roles](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) are now available for users of the limited access [fine-grained access control authorization model](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/network-authorization#ip-allowlisting):
    
    - Cluster Operator 
    - Billing Coordinator
    - Org Administrator
