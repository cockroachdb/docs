<h3>General changes</h3>

- New CockroachCloud clusters will now run CockroachDB [v20.2.8]({% link releases/v20.2.md %}#v20-2-8).
- [CockroachCloud Free](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart) clusters are now available in four additional regions:
    - GCP: `europe-west1`, `asia-southeast1`
    - AWS: `eu-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`

<h3>Console changes</h3>

- New users can now [sign up](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-an-account) for CockroachCloud with Github Authorization. Logging in with GitHub allows users to enforce [GitHub's two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) on their CockroachCloud account. Current users can [switch their login method](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-an-account#change-your-login-method) between email and GitHub.
- When logging in fails due to user input, the error message now includes [login method](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-an-account#change-your-login-method) as a potential reason for failure.
- Previously, selecting a new cloud provider while [creating a cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-a-serverless-cluster) would reset the **Region** and **Hardware per node** options to default. Now, equivalent region and hardware options are preselected, and the number of nodes per region is preserved when a new cloud provider is selected.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- **Contact Us** links now direct users to the [customer support portal](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/) instead of the user's mail app.
