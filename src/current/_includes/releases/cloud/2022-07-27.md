<h3>General changes</h3>

- You can now [add and remove regions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cluster-management) from CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters through the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console. This change makes it easier to support users in new locations or scale down your cluster.
