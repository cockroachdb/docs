<h3>General changes</h3>

New CockroachCloud clusters will now run CockroachDB [v20.2.3]({% link releases/v20.2.md %}#v20-2-3).

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where deleting your only organization would prevent your email from being used for a new organization in the future.
- Fixed a bug where [VPC peering](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/network-authorization#vpc-peering) appeared to be available on clusters that it wasn't supported on.
