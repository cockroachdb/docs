<h3>Console changes</h3>

- You no longer need to download a CA certificate to [connect to a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }}](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/connect-to-a-serverless-cluster) cluster through the CockroachDB SQL client if your cluster is running [v21.2.5]({% link releases/v21.2.md %}) or later.
- When [creating a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster), the approximate monthly cost is now displayed in the **Summary** sidebar along with the hourly cost.
