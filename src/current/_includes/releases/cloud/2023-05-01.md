<h3> General changes </h3>

The following changes were made to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} for **new organizations** created on or after April 26, 2023. **Existing organizations will not be affected until August 1, 2023**.

- The price of [Request Units (RUs)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster-serverless#request-units) increased from $1 per 10M RU to $2 per 10M RUs.
- The price of [storage](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/architecture#storage) decreased from $1 per 1 GiB storage to $0.50 per 1 GiB storage.
- Free resources are allocated on a per-organization basis instead of a per-cluster basis. All All non-contract organizations will now receive 50M Request Units per month and 10 GiB of storage for free. Free resources do not apply to contract customers.
- All resources are available instantly at the beginning of each month (burst and baseline RUs are now deprecated).
- You can now [set separate RU and storage limits](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management#edit-your-resource-limits) for your clusters, or set a spend limit that will be divided between resources automatically.
- You can now [set unlimited resources](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management#edit-your-resource-limits) for a cluster so your workload is never restricted.
- Organizations on the free plan will have at most one free serverless cluster (instead of the previous limit of five free clusters). **Cockroach Labs will continue to maintain all existing free clusters with the new organization-level free resources**.
- Organizations can now create 200 serverless clusters instead of the previous maximum of five total clusters.

<h3> Console changes </h3>

- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can now [use the Cloud Console for full-cluster restores](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups?filters=dedicated#restore-a-cluster).
- The [**Access Management** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/managing-access) in the Cloud Console now shows only relevant content based on the [user's role assignments](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles).

<h3> Cloud API changes </h3>

- [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) responses now contain a header called `Cc-Trace-Id` that can be provided to [Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com) to help with diagnostics or troubleshooting.
- The `CreateCluster` and `UpdateCluster` methods now support setting individual monthly limits for a cluster's [Request Units](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/architecture#request-unit-ru) and [storage](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/architecture#storage) usage.
- If your organization is enrolled in the new fine-grained authorization model described under **Security Updates**, you can assign the [new roles](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) to both users and service accounts using the [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) or [Terraform provider](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform) in addition to the {{ site.data.products.Cloud }} Console.

<h3> Security updates </h3>

- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} is transitioning to a new [authorization model](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#overview-of-the-cockroachdb-cloud-two-level-authorization-model) that offers fine-grained access-control (FGAC), meaning that users can be given access to exactly the actions and resources required to perform their tasks. Changes include [cluster-level roles](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) and consistent access management across users and service accounts. This feature is in [limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability), and you can enroll your organization by contacting your account team. For more information, see [Managing Access (Authorization) in CockroachDB Cloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/managing-access).

- You can now use client certificates to authenticate to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters. First, a [cluster administrator](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) needs to upload a CA certificate for the cluster using the [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) or [Terraform provider](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform). After that, individual users can be assigned client certificates signed by the uploaded CA certificate, which they can then use to connect to the cluster. This feature is in [limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability), and you can enroll your organization by contacting your account team.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- The [**Connect to your cluster**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/connect-to-your-cluster) dialog and [**Databases** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/databases-page) in the Console now respond significantly faster for clusters with over 100 databases.
- Fixed a bug where table and database [restores](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups) were disabled for clusters running CockroachDB versions [v22.2.6]({% link releases/v22.2.md %}#v22-2-6) or below.
