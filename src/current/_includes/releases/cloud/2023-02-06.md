- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} is now [compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/security-reference/security-overview). To learn more about achieving PCI DSS compliance with CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}, contact your Cockroach Labs account team.
- [Cloud Organization Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-org-sso#cloud-organization-sso) is now available to all CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} users.

    - The cluster must be running CockroachDB [v22.2.0]({% link releases/v22.2.md %}) or later.
    - The cluster must have been created as a [private cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/private-clusters). To create a private cluster, your organization  must be enrolled in the private cluster preview, which is separate from the CMEK preview. Contact your Cockroach Labs account team to enroll in both previews.

To create a private cluster, your organization  must be enrolled in the private cluster preview, which is separate from the Egress Perimeter Controls preview. Contact your Cockroach Labs account team to enroll in both previews.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>
