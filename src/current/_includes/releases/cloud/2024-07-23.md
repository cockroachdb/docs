- When creating a new CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster, you can now [select the cluster's major version]({% link cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.md %}#step-8-select-the-cockroachdb-version), which defaults to the latest stable version. At any given time, you may be able to choose from additional stable releases or experimental [Pre-Production Preview]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}#pre-production-preview-upgrades) releases. Patch releases within a major version, including subsequent patches after a Pre-Production Preview, are applied automatically.
