- New CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters will now have [Admission Control](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/architecture/admission-control) enabled by default.

<h3>Console changes</h3>

- The **Add/remove nodes** button is now disabled for custom clusters. If you are a contract customer and would like to scale your custom cluster, [contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/).

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an error was occurring on the [VPC Peering and AWS PrivateLink](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/network-authorization) pages for clusters with a large number of jobs.
- Fixed a bug where the **Test email alerts** section on the [**Alerts** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/alerts-page) was not visible for organizations with only custom clusters.
- Fixed a bug where users were prompted to upgrade CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters, which are [upgraded automatically](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy).
- Previously, [SQL metrics graphs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page) for inactive CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters showed discontinuous time series lines or an error message. Continuous graphs will now remain available for scaled-down clusters.
