## December 6, 2021

<h3>General changes</h3>

- New {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters will now run [v21.2.1]({% link releases/v21.2.md %}#v21-2-1).
- {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters will now run CockroachDB [v21.2.0-beta.4]({% link releases/v21.2.md %}#v21-2-0-beta-4).
- New {{ site.data.products.db }} clusters will now have [Admission Control](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/architecture/admission-control) enabled by default.
- {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters will now run on new [machine types and disks](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster#step-2-select-the-cloud-provider). Clusters created before December 1, 2021 will be transitioned to the new hardware configurations by the end of the month, and pricing may change slightly.

<h3>Console changes</h3>

- The **Add/remove nodes** button is now disabled for custom clusters. If you are a contract customer and would like to scale your custom cluster, [contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/).

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an error was occurring on the [VPC Peering and AWS PrivateLink](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/network-authorization) pages for clusters with a large number of jobs.
- Fixed a bug where the **Test email alerts** section on the [**Alerts** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/alerts-page) was not visible for organizations with only custom clusters.
- Fixed a bug where users were prompted to upgrade {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters, which are [upgraded automatically](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy).
- Previously, [SQL metrics graphs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page) for inactive {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters showed discontinuous time series lines or an error message. Continuous graphs will now remain available for scaled-down clusters.
