<h3> General changes </h3>

- Contract customers can now [create CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} advanced clusters](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster#step-1-start-the-cluster-creation-process), which have all the features of CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} standard clusters, plus security features needed for [PCI DSS compliance](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/pci-dss). To upgrade your organization to a contract, [contact us](https://cockroachlabs.com/contact-sales).
- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters now [export the following metrics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/export-metrics#the-metricexport-endpoint) to third-party monitoring tools such as [Datadog](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/export-metrics?filters=datadog-metrics-export) and [Amazon CloudWatch](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/export-metrics?filters=aws-metrics-export):
  - `storage_l0_sublevels`
  - `storage_l0_num_files`
  - `security_certificate_expiration_ca`
  - `sql_mem_root_current`
  - `sys_host_disk_iopsinprogress`
  
<h3> Cloud API changes </h3>

- You can now upgrade, roll back, or manually finalize a pending upgrade to your cluster using the [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api).
- The [Cloud API endpoints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) that were in preview for configuring metric export have been replaced with specific endpoints for each supported third-party tool integration. For example, `EnableMetricExport` is now replaced by `EnableDatadogMetricExport` and `EnableCloudWatchMetricExport`.

<h3> Security updates </h3>

- [Admins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#org-administrator-legacy) of organizations that have [enabled Cloud Organization SSO](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-org-sso) can now reset the passwords of other users in their organization who authenticate using passwords rather than an SSO authentication method.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- Fixed a bug where a `404` error would display when navigating from certain pages to the **Clusters** page.
- Removed an unnecessary warning that could appear when downloading CA certificates for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters.
