<h3>Console changes</h3>

- {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can now choose any of the available hardware options when [configuring a cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster). Previously, there were restrictions based on which storage and compute combinations were recommended for best performance.
- In the [**Connect to your cluster**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/connect-to-your-cluster) dialog, your previous SQL user, database, and connection method selections are now cached to make it easier to re-connect to your cluster.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where the **SQL Activity** tab for clusters running different CockroachDB versions did not always load version-appropriate UI components.
- Fixed a bug where the **Statements** table on a transaction's [**Transaction Details** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/transactions-page) sometimes showed an incorrect number of statements.
