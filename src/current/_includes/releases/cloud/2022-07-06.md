<h3>Console changes</h3>

- The [**Connect to your cluster**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/connect-to-the-database) dialog now includes code snippets for [supported languages and tools](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/third-party-database-tools).
- The [**Connect to your cluster**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/connect-to-a-serverless-cluster) dialog for clusters running CockroachDB [v22.1]({% link releases/v22.1.md %}) now loads more quickly.
- If users log in using an [SSO](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-org-sso) method other than the one they have used previously, they will now be asked if they want to switch to the new login method.
- Previously, CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users could only choose storage amounts within the [recommendations](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster?filters=dedicated) for the selected machine size. Now, a warning message will appear if the storage is outside the recommended range, but any storage option can be selected.
- The date and time selection on the [**Statements**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/statements-page) and [**Transactions**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/transactions-page) pages now defaults to UTC and has an improved design.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- The [**Statements** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/statements-page) no longer crashes when a search term contains `*`.
