<h3>General changes</h3>

New CockroachCloud clusters will now run CockroachDB [v20.2.4]({% link releases/v20.2.md %}#v20-2-4).

- [CockroachCloud Free](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/serverless-faqs) is now in beta. CockroachCloud Free (beta) delivers free CockroachDB clusters for you and your organization. It is a managed instance of CockroachDB that removes the friction of initial cluster sizing and auto-scales based on your application traffic. There is an upper limit of usage of up to 1 vCPU and 5GB storage per free cluster.

    You can submit feedback or log any bugs you find through [this survey](https://forms.gle/jWNgmCFtF4y15ePw5).

- You can now [restore databases and tables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups) from backups of CockroachCloud clusters. This feature is only available to clusters running the paid version of CockroachCloud.
- [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) has been added to the sign up process for new users signing up with an email and password. Some users may need to complete an image challenge.
- An email will now be sent to [Org Administrators](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#org-administrator) when a [30-day free trial of CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }}](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart-trial-cluster) is nearing its end and once it has expired.
