<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- The CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console now utilizes the same [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cluster-settings) as the DB Console, `sql.index_recommendation.drop_unused_duration`, as a threshold value for dropping unused indexes.
- Fixed a bug where [AWS PrivateLink](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/network-authorization#aws-privatelink) endpoints could fail to create but display an error message that said they were still creating.
