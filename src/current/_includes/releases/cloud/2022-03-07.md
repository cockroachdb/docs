<h3>Console changes</h3>

- {{ site.data.products.db }} clusters now have a **Databases** page in the Console, which shows your databases, tables, indexes, and grants.
- When creating or editing a SQL user, passwords are now generated and saved automatically when users click the **Generate and save password** button. Previously, users had to enter passwords manually and remember to save them.
- {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can now [restore](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html) databases configured for multiple regions.
