<h3> Console changes </h3>

- Previously, when trying to remove a region from a three-region cluster, only the second and third regions were removable. Two regions must be removed at once because a two-region cluster is not a valid configuration, but users can now select any two regions to remove.
- The character limit for cluster names was raised from 20 to 40 characters.

<h3> Cloud API changes </h3>

- Added the ability to create, edit, and delete a database through the [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api).

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- In the {{ site.data.products.serverless }} connection dialog, the inline password input has been given a placeholder value to prevent it from interacting in unexpected ways with password managers.
