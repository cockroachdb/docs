<h3 id="v19-1-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Some incorrect issue links referenced to by error hints have been corrected. [#43234][#43234]
- Prevented rare cases of infinite looping on database files written with a CockroachDB version earlier than v2.1.9. [#43253][#43253]
- [Changefeeds](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) now emit backfill row updates for a dropped column when the table descriptor drops that column. [#43037][#43037] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.1/explain.html) can now be used with statements that use [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v19.1/as-of-system-time.html). [#43305][#43305] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed a bug that caused some jobs to be left indefinitely in a pending state and never run. [#43416][#43416]
- Migrating the privileges on the `system.lease` table no longer creates a deadlock during a [cluster upgrade](../v19.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html). [#43508][#43508]
- Fixed a bug in the parsing logic for `server.host_based_authentication.configuration`, where both single-character strings and quoted strings containing spaces and separated by commas were not properly parsed. This would cause rules for usernames consisting of a single character or usernames containing spaces to apply improperly. [#43812][#43812]
- A SQL row write that is re-issued after already succeeding no longer throws a duplicate key error when the previous write in its transaction deleted the row. [#43942][#43942]
- Fixed a changefeed bug  where a resolved timestamp might be published before all events that precede it have been published in the presence of a range merge. [#44082][#44082]
- Converted a panic when using collated strings to an error. [#44119][#44119]

<h3 id="v19-1-7-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- A transaction running into multiple intents from an abandoned conflicting transaction now cleans them up more efficiently. [#43589][#43589]
