<h3 id="v22-1-21-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- If a page crashes, a force refresh is no longer required to be able to see the other pages on [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-overview). [#103326][#103326]
- On the [SQL Activity > Fingerprints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-statements-page#sql-statement-fingerprints) view, users will not see stats that have not yet been flushed to disk. [#103130][#103130]
- Users can now request top-k stmts by % runtime on the [SQL Activity > Fingerprints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-overview#sql-activity) view. [#103130][#103130]
- Added Search Criteria to the [Statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-statements-page) and [Transactions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-transactions-page) pages. [#103130][#103130]

<h3 id="v22-1-21-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in [closed timestamp](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/architecture/transaction-layer#closed-timestamps) updates within its side-transport. Previously, during [asymmetric network partitions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#network-partition), a node that transfers a lease away, and misses a [liveness heartbeat](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/architecture/replication-layer#epoch-based-leases-table-data), could then erroneously update the closed timestamp during the stasis period of its liveness. This could lead to closed timestamp invariant violation, and node crashes. In extreme cases this could lead to inconsistencies in read-only queries. [#102597][#102597]
- The value of `pg_constraint.conparentid` is now `0` rather than `NULL`. CockroachDB does not support constraints on [partitions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/partitioning). [#103230][#103230]
