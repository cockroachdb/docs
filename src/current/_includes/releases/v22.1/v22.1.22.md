<h3 id="v22-1-22-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Improved the error message that is logged when a changefeed is triggered by dropping the parent database or a type. The previous error was of the format `value type is not BYTES: UNKNOWN`. [#107943][#107943]

<h3 id="v22-1-22-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- When no data is persisted to SQL statistics tables, such as when no flush has occurred or when flushing is disabled, the endpoint's combined view is shown, which includes in-memory data. [#104052][#104052]

<h3 id="v22-1-22-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where `SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` returned no information for a database with uppercase or special characters in its name. [#103954][#103954]
- Fixed a bug where additional empty bytes were written to files in Amazon S3 when the internal cluster setting `cloudstorage.s3.buffer_and_put_uploads.enabled` is `true`. [#104132][#104132]
- Fixed a bug where running a debug command that manipulates a store, such as `debug compact`, on a running node could corrupt the store if [Encryption At Rest]({% link v23.1/encryption.md %}) was enabled. [#104141][#104141]
- Fixed a null-pointer exception introduced in v22.2.9 and v23.1.1 that could cause a node to crash when populating SQL Activity pages in the DB Console. [#104052][#104052]
