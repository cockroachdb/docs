{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-22-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Improved the error message that is logged when a changefeed is triggered by dropping the parent database or a type. The previous error was of the format `value type is not BYTES: UNKNOWN`. [#107943][#107943]

<h3 id="v22-1-22-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- When no data is persisted to SQL statistics tables, such as when no flush has occurred or when flushing is disabled, the endpoint's combined view is shown, which includes in-memory data. [#104052][#104052]

<h3 id="v22-1-22-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where `SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` returned no information for a database with uppercase or special characters in its name. [#103954][#103954]
- Fixed a bug that would result in corruption of [encrypted data at rest on a cluster node]({% link v23.1/encryption.md %}). If a node with this corrupted state was restarted, the node could fail to rejoin the cluster. If multiple nodes encountered this bug at the same time during roll out, the cluster could lose [quorum]({% link v23.1/architecture/replication-layer.md %}#overview). For more information, refer to [Technical Advisory 106617](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/advisories/a106617).[#104141][#104141]
- Fixed a null-pointer exception introduced in v22.2.9 and v23.1.1 that could cause a node to crash when populating SQL Activity pages in the DB Console. [#104052][#104052]
