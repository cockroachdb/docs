## v22.1.19

Release Date: April 25, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-19-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Queries with invalid syntax are now logged at the `INFO` level on the [`SQL_EXEC` logging channel](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/sql-audit-logging). Previously, they were logged at the `ERROR` level. [#101090][#101090]

<h3 id="v22-1-19-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `prepared_statements_cache_size` [session setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/set-vars) that helps to prevent [prepared statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/savepoint#savepoints-and-prepared-statements) leaks by automatically deallocating the least-recently-used prepared statements when the cache reaches a given size. [#99264][#99264]

<h3 id="v22-1-19-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- New data is now auto-fetched every 5 minutes on the [**Statement and Transaction Fingerprints**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-statements-page#statement-fingerprint-page) pages. [#100702][#100702]

<h3 id="v22-1-19-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, [`ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT cluster_logical_timestamp()`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/alter-table) would crash the node and leave the table in a corrupt state. The root cause is a `nil` pointer dereference. The bug is now fixed by returning an unimplemented error and hence disallowing using the [builtin function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/functions-and-operators#array-functions) as the default value when backfilling. [#99682][#99682]
- Fixed a bug where the stats columns on the [**Transaction Fingerprint Overview**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-transactions-page#transaction-details-page) page was continuously incrementing. [#99405][#99405]
- Fixed a bug that prevented the [garbage collection](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/architecture/storage-layer#garbage-collection) job for the [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/truncate) command from successfully finishing if the table descriptor had already been garbage collected. The garbage collection job now succeeds in this situation by handling the missing descriptor edge case. [#100146][#100146]
- Fixed a bug present in v21.1 that would cause the SQL gateway node to crash if a [view was created](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/create-view) with circular or self-referencing dependencies. [#100165][#100165]
- Fixed a bug in evaluation of `ANY`, `SOME`, and `ALL` [sub-operators](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/functions-and-operators#operators) that would cause expressions like `NULL = ANY(ARRAY[]::INT[])` to return `NULL` instead of `FALSE`. [#100363][#100363]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a cached query with a [user-defined type](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/create-type) reference from being invalidated even after a [schema change](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/online-schema-changes) that should prevent the type from being resolved. [#100358][#100358]
- Fixed a bug existing before v22.1 that could cause a projected expression to replace column references with incorrect values. [#100368][#100368]
- Fixed a bug where the physical disk space of some tables could not be calculated. [#100937][#100937]
- Fixed a bug so that the [`crdb_internal.deserialize_session`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/crdb-internal) function works properly with prepared statements that have more parameter type hints than parameters. [#101363][#101363]
- Fixed a bug where in [PostgreSQL Extended Query protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY) mode it was possible for auto-commits to not execute certain logic for DDL, when certain DML ([`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/insert)/[`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/update)/[`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/delete)) and DDL were combined in an implicit transaction. [#101630][#101630]
- In the [**DB Console SQL Activity**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-overview#sql-activity) pages, issuing a new request for stats while one is pending is now allowed and will replace the pending request. [#100702][#100702]
- Fixed a rare condition that could allow a [transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/transactions) to get stuck indefinitely waiting on a released row-level [lock](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/architecture/transaction-layer#concurrency-control) if the per-range lock count limit was exceeded while the transaction was waiting on another lock. [#100944][#100944]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB incorrectly evaluated [`EXPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/export) statements that had a projection or rendering on top of the `EXPORT`. (For example, `WITH CTE AS (EXPORT INTO CSV 'nodelocal://1/export1/' FROM SELECT * FROM t) SELECT filename FROM CTE;` would not work.) Previously, such statements would result in panics or incorrect query results. [#101808][#101808]

<h3 id="v22-1-19-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Removed prettify usages that could cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors on the [**Statement Details**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-statements-page) and [**Transaction Details**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/ui-transactions-page) page. [#99452][#99452]
