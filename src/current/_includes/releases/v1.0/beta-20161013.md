Release Date: {{ include.release_date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

This week's release includes many user-visible changes and features that have been in development since our [stability-focused "code yellow"](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cant-run-100-node-cockroachdb-cluster/) started back in August. When we entered "code yellow", all work unrelated to stability was done in a secondary development environment. Since then, we've made great progress, and so have moved many of these new features back into our main development environment.

<h3 id="beta-20161013-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) values are now stored with microsecond precision instead of nanoseconds. All nanosecond-related functions have been removed. An existing table `t` with nanosecond timestamps in column `s` can round them to microseconds with `UPDATE t SET s = s + '0s'`. However, note that this could potentially cause uniqueness problems if the timestamp is a primary key. [#8864](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8864)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) values (without `TIME ZONE`) are now parsed in UTC, not in the session time zone. [#9444](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9444)
- The deprecated `--http-addr` flag has been removed. When [starting a node](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/start-a-node), use the `--http-host` flag instead to specify the address to listen on for Admin UI HTTP requests. [#9725](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9725)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Tables can now be [interleaved](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/interleave-in-parent) into other tables. Interleaving tables improves query performance by optimizing the key-value structure of closely related tables, attempting to keep data on the same key-value range if itâ€™s likely to be read and written together. [#7985](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7985)
- The [`CREATE TABLE AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/create-table-as) statement can now be used to create a table based on the results of a `SELECT` statement. [#8802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8802), [#9278](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9278)
- The [`ALTER TABLE ... SPLIT AT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/alter-table) command can now be used to force a range split at a specified key. [#8938](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8938)
- Added new `information_schema` metatables as well as initial support for the `pg_catalog` database. This work is part of our ongoing effort to provide standard database introspection required by popular ORMs. [#8433](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8433), [#8498](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8498), [#9565](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9565), [#9114](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9114), [#9104](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9104)
- [`CHECK`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/check) constraints can now be added with the [`ALTER TABLE ADD CHECK`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/alter-table) and `ALTER TABLE VALIDATE` statements. [#9127](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9127) [#9152](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9152)
- The [`ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/alter-table) statement can now drop [`CHECK`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/check) and [`FOREIGN KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/foreign-key) constraints. [#8747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8747)
- The [`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/show-constraints) statement now requires the user to have privileges for the requested table. [#8658](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8658)
- The [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/explain) statement now works correctly for `VALUES` statements containing subqueries. [#8970](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8970)
- The [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/truncate) statement now implements the `CASCADE` modifier. [#9240](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9240)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) values that include a time zone can now omit the minutes field of the time zone offset, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#8666](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8666)
- [`INTERVAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/interval) values can now be input in a colon-delimited format (H:M or H:M_S), for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#8603](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8603)
- The `INT8` type is now supported as an alias for [`INT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/int). [#8858](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8858)
- [`INTERVAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/interval), [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp), [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp), and [`DATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/date) values can now be casted to/from more types. [#9731](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9731)
- The window functions `row_number()`, `rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `percent_rank()`, `cume_dist()`, `ntile()`, `lead()`, `lag()`, `first_value()`, `last_value()`, `nth_value()` are now supported. [#8928](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8928), [#9321](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9321), [#9335](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9335)
- The `exp()` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) returns an error if its argument is greater than 1024 instead of performing excessively expensive computation. [#8822](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8822)
- The `round()` [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators) now breaks ties by rounding to the nearest even value (also known as bankers' rounding). It is now faster, and returns an error when given an excessively large number of digits. [#8822](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8822)
- The `concat_agg` [aggregate function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators#aggregate-functions) is now supported. [#9690](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9690)
- New [date/time functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/functions-and-operators), `extract_duration()`, `experimental_strptime()` and `experimental_strftime()`, are now supported. [#9734](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9734), [#9762](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9762)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-protocol-changes">Protocol Changes</h3>

- The `COPY` protocol is now supported on the server side with the `COPY FROM` statement. The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) command-line tool does not yet recognize this command but it can be used with other client interfaces. [#8756](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8756)
- [`DECIMAL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/decimal) values are now encoded correctly for drivers that use the binary format. [#8319](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8319)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp), [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/timestamp) and [`DATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/date) values can now use the binary protocol format for clients that support it. [#8590](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8590), [#8762](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8762)
- [`NULL` values](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/null-handling) are now sent with the correct type OID, which is required by some PostgreSQL drivers. [#9331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9331)
- The [`CREATE TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/create-table) and [`CREATE DATABASE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/create-database) statements now return the standard PostgreSQL error code when the table or database already exists. [#9235](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9235)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-command-line-interface-changes">Command-line Interface Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/start-a-node#standard-output) command now prints additional fields to `stdout`: `clusterID`, `nodeID`, and `status`, which indicates whether the node started a new cluster, joined an existing cluster for the first time, or rejoined an existing cluster. [#9066](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9066)
- The [`cockroach start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/start-a-node) command now terminates with a non-zero exit status if it was interrupted with **Ctrl+C** or a signal. [#9051](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9051)
- The [`cockroach zone set`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/configure-replication-zones) command now supports the `--disable-replication` flag, which sets the desired replication factor to 1. [#9253](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9253)
- The [`cockroach gen example-data`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/generate-cockroachdb-resources) command can now be used to generate SQL for example databases. [#9231](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9231), [#9475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9475)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now presents a new prompt when **Ctrl+C** is pressed after the user starts entering a statement. [#9704](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9704)
- When using **Ctrl+R** in the [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell to recall a previous statement from the shell history, the search is now case-insensitive. [#9704](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9704)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now reports unterminated final statements as errors instead of ignoring them. [#8838](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8838)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now reports when the connection to the server is lost and a new connection is opened. [#9613](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9613)

- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now prints expressions in [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/explain) and the shell history such as `E::T` or `E:::T` in the same format entered instead of using the longer `CAST` or `TYPE_ANNOTATE` syntax. [#9739](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9739)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now stops processing statements at the first error encountered when reading from a file (non-interactively). This behavior is customizable with the new [`unset errexit`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client#sql-shell-commands) shell command. [#9610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9610)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now checks if a statement or query is syntactically valid on the client side before it is sent to the server. This ensures that a typo or mistake during user entry does not inconveniently abort an ongoing transaction previously started interactively. This behavior is customizable with the new [`unset check_syntax`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client#sql-shell-commands) shell command. [#9610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9610)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now works better with multi-line statements. In particular, users will find it easier to recall and edit previously entered multi-line statements. This behavior is customizable with a new command [`unset normalize_history`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client#sql-shell-commands). [#9610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9610)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) shell now works correctly under `kubectl` and other environments that hide the size of the terminal. [#9097](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9097)

<h3 id="beta-20161013-ui-changes">UI Changes</h3>
