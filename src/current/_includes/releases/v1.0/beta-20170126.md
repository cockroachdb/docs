<h3 id="beta-20170126-license-change">License Change</h3>

- CockroachDB is now covered by the [CockroachDB Community License](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/LICENSE). A pure open-source (APL2) version can be obtained by building from source with the `make buildoss` build target. See our [blog post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-were-building-a-business-to-last/) for more details.

- The hex string syntax `X'0d0a'` now produces [byte values](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/sql-constants#hexadecimal-encoded-byte-array-literals) instead of string values, so it can accept non-UTF-8 input. [#13094](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13094)

<h3 id="beta-20170126-new-features">New Features</h3>

- The location of replicas, both when first added and when rebalanced to maintain cluster equilibrium, is now influenced by [`--locality`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/start-a-node) settings at the node-level and more [expressive zone configuration constraints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/configure-replication-zones#replication-constraints).

- The `information_schema.statistics` table and the output of [`SHOW INDEXES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/show-index) now include columns that are added to the index implicitly (the primary key is an implicit part of secondary indexes).

- The `pg_catalog.pg_enum` table now exists (although it is always empty because we do not yet support enum types). [#12972](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12972)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_collation` table is now supported, along with the `pg_attribute.attcollation` and `pg_type.typcollation` columns. [#12983](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12983)
- The `OID` and `NAME` types are now supported (and used in `pg_catalog`) for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#12641](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12641)
- [`SHOW COLUMNS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/show-columns) now includes a summary of indices that the column is a part of. [#12907](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12907)

- The [`cockroach dump`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.0/sql-dump) has a new flag, `--dump-mode`, which can be used to dump the schema or the data for a table separately. [#12759](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12759)
- Timestamps are now displayed in a format which is accepted by the SQL parser. [#12886](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12886)
- The `--pretty` flag has been removed from commands that never used it. [#12900](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12900)
- An error is raised when too many positional command-line arguments are provided. [#12901](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12901)

<h3 id="beta-20170126-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>
