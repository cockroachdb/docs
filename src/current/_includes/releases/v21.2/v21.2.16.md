## v21.2.16

Release Date: September 29, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-2-16-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.2/explain-analyze.html) output now contains a warning when the estimated row count for scans is inaccurate. It includes a hint to collect the table [statistics](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) manually. [#86873][#86873]
- Added a [cluster setting](../v21.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.metrics.statement_details.gateway_node.enabled` that controls if the [gateway node](../v21.2/ui-sessions-page.html#session-details-gateway-node) ID should be persisted to the `system.statement_statistics` table as is or as a `0`, to decrease cardinality on the table. The node ID is still available on the statistics column. [#88636][#88636]

<h3 id="v21-2-16-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The `\c` metacommand in the [`cockroach sql`](../v21.2/cockroach-sql.html) shell no longer shows the password in plaintext. [#87550][#87550]

<h3 id="v21-2-16-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a crash that could happen when formatting queries that have placeholder `BitArray` arguments. [#86886][#86886]
- Previously, queries with many joins and projections of multi-column expressions, e.g., `col1 + col2`, either present in the query or within a virtual column definition, could experience very long optimization times or hangs, where the query is never sent for execution. This has now been fixed. [#85872][#85872]
- Fixed a bug that caused some special characters to be misread if `COPY ... FROM` into a `TEXT[]` column was reading them. [#86888][#86888]
- Fixed a crash/panic that could occur if placeholder arguments were used with the `with_min_timestamp` or `with_max_staleness` [functions](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html). [#86882][#86882]
- Previously, escaping a double quote (`"`) with [`COPY`](../v21.2/copy-from.html) in `CSV` mode could ignore all subsequent lines in the same `COPY` if an `ESCAPE` clause were specified. This is now resolved. [#86976][#86976]
- Previously, CockroachDB would return an internal error when evaluating the `json_build_object` [built-in](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html) when an [enum](../v21.2/enum.html) datum was passed as the first argument. This is now fixed. [#86850][#86850]
- Fixed a vulnerability in the [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) that could cause a panic in rare cases when planning complex queries with [`ORDER BY`](../v21.2/order-by.html). [#86807][#86807]
- An active [replication report](../v21.2/query-replication-reports.html ) update could prevent a node from shutting down until it completed. The report update is now cancelled on node shutdown instead. [#87923][#87923]
- Fixed an issue where imports and rebalances were being slowed down due to the accumulation of empty directories from range snapshot applications. [#88142][#88142]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly not fetch rows with `NULL` values when reading from the unique [secondary index](../v21.2/indexes.html) when multiple [column families](../v21.2/column-families.html) were defined for the table, and the index didn't store some of the `NOT NULL` columns. [#88207][#88207]
- Fixed a bug where if [telemetry](../v21.2/logging.html#telemetry) is enabled, [`COPY`](../v21.2/copy-from.html) can sometimes cause the server to crash. [#88326][#88326]
- Fixed a bug that could cause nodes to crash in rare cases when executing [apply joins](../v21.2/joins.html#apply-joins) in query plans. [#88518][#88518]
- Fixed a bug that caused errors in rare cases when executing queries with [correlated `WITH` expressions](../v21.2/common-table-expressions.html#correlated-common-table-expressions). This bug was present since correlated `WITH` expressions were introduced in [v21.2.0](../releases/v21.2.html?#v21-2-0). [#88518][#88518]

<h3 id="v21-2-16-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Long-running SQL sessions are now less likely to maintain large allocations for long periods of time, which decreases the risk of OOM and improves memory utilization. [#86798][#86798]
- Made sending and receiving [Raft](../v21.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#raft) queue sizes match. Previously the receiver could unnecessarily drop messages in situations when the sending queue is bigger than the receiving one. [cockroachdb/cockroach#88447][#88447]
