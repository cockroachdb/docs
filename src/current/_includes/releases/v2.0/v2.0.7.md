<h3 id="v2-0-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a security vulnerability in which data could be leaked from a cluster, or tampered with in a cluster, in secure mode. [#30823][#30823]
- Fixed a bug where queries could get stuck for seconds or minutes, usually following node restarts. [#31350][#31350]
- CockroachDB no longer crashes due to a `SIGTRAP` error soon after startup on macOS Mojave. [#31522][#31522]
- Fixed bug causing transactions to unnecessarily hit a "too large" error. [#31827][#31827]
- Fixed a bug causing transactions to appear partially committed. Occasionally, CockroachDB claimed to have failed to commit a transaction when some (or all) of its writes were actually persisted. [#32223][#32223]
- Fixed a bug where entry application on Raft followers could fall behind entry application on the leader, causing stalls during splits. [#32601][#32601]
- CockroachDB now properly rejects queries that use an invalid function (e.g., an aggregation) in the `SET` clause of an [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/update) statement. [#32507][#32507]

<h3 id="v2-0-7-build-changes">Build changes</h3>
