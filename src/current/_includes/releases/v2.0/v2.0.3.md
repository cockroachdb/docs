<h3 id="v2-0-3-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- The new `compactor.threshold_bytes` and `max_record_age` [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/cluster-settings) can be used to configure the compactor. [#25458][#25458]
- The new `cluster.preserve_downgrade_option` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/cluster-settings) makes it possible to preserve the option to downgrade after [performing a rolling upgrade to v2.1](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/upgrade-cockroach-version). [#25811][#25811]

<h3 id="v2-0-3-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Prevented [`DROP TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/drop-table) from using too much CPU. [#25852][#25852]

<h3 id="v2-0-3-command-line-changes">Command-Line Changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client) command no longer prompts for a password when a certificate is provided. [#26232][#26232]
- The [`cockroach quit`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/stop-a-node) command now prints warning messages to the standard error stream, not to standard output. [#26163][#26163]

<h3 id="v2-0-3-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Prevented the internal gossip network from being partitioned by making it much less likely that nodes in the network could forget about each other. [#25521][#25521]
- Prevented spurious `BudgetExceededErrors` for some queries that read a lot of JSON data from disk. [#25719][#25719]
- Fixed a crash in some cases when using a `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`. [#25654][#25654]
- Fixed a crash caused by inserting data into a table with [computed columns](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/computed-columns) that reference other columns that weren't present in the `INSERT` statement. [#25807][#25807]
- [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/upsert) is now properly able to write `NULL` values to every column in tables containing more than one [column family](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/column-families). [#26181][#26181]
- Fixed a bug where a long-running query running from one day to the next would not always produce the right value for `current_date()`. [#26413][#26413]
- Fixed a bug where [`cockroach quit`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/stop-a-node) would erroneously fail even though the node already successfully shut down. [#26163][#26163]
- Rows larger than 8192 bytes are now supported by the "copy from" protocol. [#26641][#26641]
- Trying to "copy from stdin" into a table that doesn't exist no longer drops the connection. [#26641][#26641]
- Previously, expired compactions could stay in the queue forever. Now, they are removed when they expire. [#26659][#26659]

<h3 id="v2-0-3-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- The performance impact of dropping a large table has been substantially reduced. [#26615][#26615]

<h3 id="v2-0-3-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Documented [special syntax forms](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/functions-and-operators#special-syntax-forms) of built-in SQL functions and [conditional and function-like operators](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/functions-and-operators#conditional-and-function-like-operators), and updated the [SQL operator order of precedence](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/functions-and-operators#operators). [#3192][#3192]
- Added best practices on [understanding and avoiding transaction contention](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/performance-best-practices-overview#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) and a related [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/operational-faqs#why-would-increasing-the-number-of-nodes-not-result-in-more-operations-per-second). [#3156][#3156]
- Improved the documentation of [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/as-of-system-time). [#3155][#3155]
- Expanded the [manual deployment](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/manual-deployment) guides to cover running a sample workload against a cluster. [#3149][#3149]
- Added FAQs on [generating unique, slowly increasing sequential numbers](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/sql-faqs#how-do-i-generate-unique-slowly-increasing-sequential-numbers-in-cockroachdb) and [the differences between `UUID`, sequences, and `unique_rowid()`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v2.0/sql-faqs#what-are-the-differences-between-uuid-sequences-and-unique_rowid).
