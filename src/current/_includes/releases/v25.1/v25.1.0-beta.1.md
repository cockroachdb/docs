<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- when a user runs CREATE LOGICALLY REPLICATED TABLE,
  they must specify one of the following options:
  - UNIDIRECTIONAL: setups a unidirectional stream with fast initial scan
  - BIDIRECTIONAL ON {dest uri}: sets up a bidirectional stream from the original
    dest to the original source. [#138297][#138297]
- LDR and PCR may use the `crdb_route=gateway`
  query option to route the replication streams over a load balancer.
  
  Epic: CRDB-40896 [#138697][#138697]

- The cluster setting
  `changefeed.frontier_highwater_lag_checkpoint_threshold` has been
  renamed to `changefeed.span_checkpoint.lag_threshold`. The old name
  remains available for backwards-compatibility. [#139064][#139064]
- the `node decommission` cli command now waits
  until the target node is drained before marking it as fully
  decommissioned. Previously, it would start drain but not wait, leaving
  the target node briefly in a state where it would be unable to
  communicate with the cluster but would still accept client requests
  (which would then hang or hit unexpected errors). [#138732][#138732]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where columns created with GENERATED
  ... BY IDENTITY with the SERIAL type could incorrectly fail internal
  validations. [#139084][#139084]
- Bounded memory leak that could previously occur
  when evaluating some memory-intensive queries via the vectorized engine
  in CockroachDB has now been fixed. The leak has been present since 20.2
  version. [#138804][#138804]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-1-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Roll back the use of PGO for releases. We
  plan to implement this instead for 25.2. Testing the file changes to check if changes are reflected on Database
