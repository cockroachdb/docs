Release Date: December 19, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The old `BACKUP TO`, `RESTORE FROM <collectionURI>`, and `SHOW BACKUP IN <collectionURI>` syntaxes are now fully deprecated and no longer usable. [#133610][#133610]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- This fix will add support for partial roles from ldap synced group to be mapped to crdb roles and ensure appropriate erroring for undesired behavior. [#135552][#135552]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- In order to improve the granularity of changefeed pipeline metrics, the changefeed metrics changefeed.admit_latency and changefeed.commit_latency have histogram buckets from 5ms to 60m (previously  500ms to 5m). The changefeed metrics changefeed.parallel_io_queue_nanos, changefeed.parallel_io_result_queue_nanos, changefeed.sink_batch_hist_nanos, changefeed.flush_hist_nanos, and changefeed.kafka_throttling_hist_nanos have histogram buckets from 5ms to 10m (previously 500ms to 5m). [#136265][#136265]
- Add support for multiple seed brokers in the new kafka sink. [#136632][#136632]
- Add a new metric (`distsender.rangefeed.catchup_ranges_waiting_client_side`) that counts how many rangefeeds are waiting on the client-side limiter to start performing catchup scans. [#136741][#136741]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Add `system.users` to the list of system tables that changefeeds protect with PTS. This table is required for CDC Queries. [#133568][#133568]
- Adds AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE param to S3 URI parsing. [#136715][#136715]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Two new builtins, crdb_internal. {lease_holder, range_stats}_with_errors, include errors encountered while fetching lease holder and range stats. These new builtins are used by `crdb_internal.ranges`, which includes a new column, `errors`, that combines the errors from the builtins. [#131232][#131232]
- This commit turns on cluster setting `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection.enabled` by default, which enables automatic collection of partial table stats. Partial table stats (i.e. those created with `CREATE STATISTICS ... USING EXTREMES`) scan the lower and upper ends of indexes to collect statistics outside the range covered by the previous full statistics collection. [#133988][#133988]
- When triggers fire one another cyclically, the new `recursion_depth_limit` setting now limits the depth of the recursion. By default, the limit is `1000` nested trigger executions. [#134498][#134498]
- The names of BEFORE triggers fired by a mutation now show up in the EXPLAIN output. The trigger-function invocations are visible in the output of verbose EXPLAIN. [#135556][#135556]
- AFTER triggers will now show up in the output of vanilla `EXPLAIN`, as well as `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. [#135556][#135556]
- Added support for `SHOW TRIGGERS`, which displays the names of all triggers on a table, as well as whether each trigger is enabled. The user must have any privilege on the table, or be its owner. [#135778][#135778]
- Added support for `SHOW CREATE TRIGGER`, which displays the CREATE statement for a trigger. The user must have any privilege on the table, or be its owner. [#135778][#135778]
- Added an informational notice to the result of `CREATE TABLE ... AS` statements that describes that indexes and constraints are not copied to the new table. [#135845][#135845]
- Altering a columnâ€™s type no longer requires enabling the enable_experimental_alter_column_type_general setting. This change makes the feature generally available. [#135936][#135936]
- Add support for COLLATE expressions on arrays of strings, to better match PostgreSQL. [#133751][#133751]
- Adds column "readable_high_water_timestamp" to the output of SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS. "high_water_timestamp" still exists and is in epoch nanoseconds. This human readable form will be easier to consume. [#135623][#135623]
- The sql_safe_updates setting must be disabled to perform ALTER COLUMN TYPE operations that require a column rewrite. [#136110][#136110]
- This patch adds a new CREATE LDR syntax which will direct the LDR job to create the destination table(s) using a copy of the source table(s). [#136841][#136841]
- It is now possible to execute queries with correlated joins with sub-queries or CTEs in both the "inner" and "outer" context. Errors with the following message: ``` unimplemented: apply joins with subqueries in the "inner" and "outer" contexts are not supported ``` will no longer occur. [#136506][#136506]
- It is now possible to include a CTE within the body of a UDF or stored procedure. [#136506][#136506]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The setting kv.rangefeed.scheduler.enabled has been retired. The rangefeed scheduler is now unconditionally enabled. [#132825][#132825]
- A new cluster setting `ui.database_locality_metadata.enabled` allows operators to disable loading extended database and table region information in the DB Console Database and Table pages. This information can cause significant CPU load on large clusters with many ranges. Versions of this page from 24.3 onwards do not have this problem. If customers will require this data, they can use the `SHOW RANGES FROM {DATABASE| TABLE}` query via SQL to compute on-demand. [#133075][#133075]
- The metrics scrape HTTP endpoint at `/ _status/vars` will now truncate HELP text at the first sentence, reducing the metadata for metrics with large descriptions. Customers can still access these descriptions via our docs. [#134724][#134724]
- The row-level TTL job now will periodically update the progress meter in the jobs introspection interfaces, including SHOW JOBS and the Jobs page in the DB console. [#135142][#135142]
- The setting can be be set between 0.04 and 0.3. [#135779][#135779]
- Add two new metrics, `sql.distsql.select.distributed_exec.count` and `sql.distsql.select.distributed_exec.count.internal`. These metrics count the number of SELECT statements that actually execute with full or partial distribution. These metrics differ from `sql.distsql.select.count` and `sql.distsql.select.count.internal` in that the latter count the number of SELECT statements that are *planned* with full or partial distribution, but might not necessarily execute with full or partial distribution, depending on the location of data. [#135236][#135236]
- Add new metric `sql.distsql.distributed_exec.count` which counts the number of invocations of the execution engine with full or partial distribution. (This is in contrast to `sql.distsql.queries.total` which counts the total number of invocations of the execution engine.) [#135236][#135236]
- Add some clarification that the following metrics count invocations of the execution engine and not SQL queries (which could each result in multiple invocations of the execution engine):  - `sql.distsql.queries.active` - `sql.distsql.queries.total` - `sql.distsql.distributed_exec.count` [#135236][#135236]
- Removed the sql.auth.resolve_membership_single_scan.enabled cluster setting. This was added out of precaution in case it was necessary to revert back to the old behavior for looking up role memberships, but this escape hatch has never been needed in practice since this was added in v23.1. [#135852][#135852]
- Telemetry delivery is now considered successful even in cases where we experience a network timeout. This will prevent throttling in cases outside an operator's control. [#136219][#136219]
- When a schema change job is completed, rolls back, or encounteres a failure, the time taken since the job began is now logged in a structured log in the SQL_SCHEMA log channel. [#136899][#136899]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- As of 25.1 the legacy db page which was previously available via Advanced Debug is no longer available. [#134005][#134005]
- When activating statement diagnostics in the DB Console, users now have the option to produce a redacted bundle as output. This bundle will omit sensitive data. [#134723][#134723]
- Fixes UI bugs in db-console. See commit message for full list of bug fixes. [#135293][#135293]
- Link in plan details page to legacy table page has been removed. [#136311][#136311]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented the create statement for a routine from being shown in a statement bundle. This happened when the routine was created on a schema other than `public`. The bug has existed since v23.1. [#132147][#132147]
- Reduce the duration of partitions in the gossip network when a node crashes in order to eliminate false positives in the `ranges.unavailable` metric. [#133300][#133300]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect evaluation of some binary expressions involving `CHAR(N)` values and untyped string literals with trailing whitespace characters. For example, the expression `'f'::CHAR = 'f '` now correctly evaluates to `true`. [#133037][#133037]
- Fixed a bug that could cause DELETE triggers not to fire on cascading delete, and which could cause INSERT triggers to match incorrectly in the same scenario. [#134759][#134759]
- When you are a non-admin user and you run drop role if exists on a user that does not exist you no longer get an error message. [#134850][#134850]
- Changes the table, index contents of the hot ranges page in DB console. [#134106][#134106]
- Previously, CockroachDB would encounter an internal error when evaluating `FETCH ABSOLUTE 0` statements, and this is now fixed. The bug has been present since 22.1 version. [#134919][#134919]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause incorrect query results when the optimizer planned a lookup join on an index containing a column of type `CHAR(N)`, `VARCHAR(N)`, `BIT(N)`, `VARBIT(N)`, or `DECIMAL(M, N)`, and the query held that column constant to a single value (e.g., with an equality filter). [#134891][#134891]
- Fix a bug that prevented restoring cluster backup taken in an MR cluster that had configured a the system database with a region configuration into a non-multi-region cluster. Epic: CRDB-42475. [#134604][#134604]
- Fixed an unhandled error that would occur if DROP SCHEMA was executed on the `public` schema of the `system` database, or on an internal schema like `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. [#135149][#135149]
- Prevent ALTER DATABASE operations that modify the zone config from hanging if an invalid zone config already exists. [#135168][#135168]
- CockroachDB now correctly evaluates `percentile_cont` and `percentile_disc` aggregates over FLOAT4 values (previously we would return an error). [#135130][#135130]
- The schema changer's backfill process now includes a retry mechanism that reduces the batch size when memory issues occur. This improves the likelihood of operation success without requiring manual adjustment of the bulko.index_backfill.batch_size parameter. [#135563][#135563]
- CREATE SCHEMA now returns the correct error if a the schema name is missing. [#135910][#135910]
- Fixed an issue where corrupted table statistics could cause the cockroach process to crash. [#135944][#135944]
- Table statistics collection in CockroachDB could previously run into `no bytes in account to release` errors in some edge cases (when the SQL memory budget, configured via `--max-sql-memory` flag, was close to being exhausted). The bug has been present since 21.2 and is now fixed. [#135970][#135970]
- Security.certificate.* metrics will now be updated if a node loads new certificates while running. [#135596][#135596]
- A table that is participating in a logical replication stream can no longer be dropped. Previously this was allowed, which would cause all the replicated rows to end up in the dead-letter queue. [#136172][#136172]
- ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL was not enforced consistently when the table created in the same txn. [#136298][#136298]
- Create relation / type could leave dangling namespace entries if the schema was concurrently being dropped. [#136325][#136325]
- The `idle_in_session_timeout` setting now excludes the time spent waiting for schema changer jobs to complete, preventing unintended session termination during schema change operations. [#136463][#136463]
- Fix a bug which causes the optimizer to use stale table statistics after altering an enum type used in the table. [#136538][#136538]
- CockroachDB now better respects `statement_timeout` limit on queries involving the top K sort and merge join operations. [#136631][#136631]
- Fixed a bug that would cause the make_timestamp and make_timestamptz builtin functions to incorrectly extract the `seconds` argument if the value was less than 1. [#136804][#136804]
- Fixed possible index corruption caused by triggers that could occur when the following conditions were satisfied: 1. A query calls a UDF or stored procedure, and also performs a mutation    on a table. 2. The UDF/SP contains a statement that either fires an AFTER trigger, or    fires a cascade that itself fires a trigger. 3. The trigger modifies the same row as the outer statement. 4. Either the outer or inner mutation is something other than an INSERT    without an `ON CONFLICT` clause. [#136076][#136076]
- Fixed an issue where license enforcement was not consistently disabled for single-node clusters started with start-single-node, ensuring proper behavior on cluster restarts. [#136926][#136926]
- Fixed bug that causes an incorrect filesystem to be logged as part of the store information. [#137024][#137024]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-alpha-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The /_status/nodes_ui API no longer returns unnecessary metrics in its response. This decreases the payload size of the API and improves the load time of various db-console pages and components. [#135186][#135186]
- Performance for some PL/pgSQL loops is now significantly improved, by as much as 3-4x. This is due to applying tail-call optimization in more cases to the recursive sub-routines that implement loops. [#135145][#135145]
- Improved the internal caching logic for role membership information. This reduces the latency impact of commands such as `DROP ROLE`, `CREATE ROLE`, and `GRANT role TO user`, which cause the role membership cache to be invalidated. [#135852][#135852]
- The session setting `plan_cache_mode` now defaults to `auto`, enabling generic query plans for some queries. [#135668][#135668]
- GRPC streams are now pooled across unary intra-cluster RPCs, allowing for reuse of gRPC resources to reduce the cost of remote key-value layer access. This pooling can be disabled using the rpc.batch_stream_pool.enabled cluster setting. [#136648][#136648]
