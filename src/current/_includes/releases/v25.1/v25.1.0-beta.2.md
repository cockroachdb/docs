<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- SHOW JOBS is now based on a new mechanism for storing information about the progress and status of running jobs. Epic: none. [#139230][#139230]
- SHOW TENANT WITH REPLICATION STATUS will now display the `ingestion_job_id` column after the `name` column. [#139275][#139275]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Customers must pass URIs as external connections to create LDR statments. [#139506][#139506]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The /_admin/v1/settings API (and therfore cluster settings console page) now returns cluster settings using the same redaction logic as querying `SHOW CLUSTER SETTINGS` and `crdb_internal.cluster_settings`. This means that only settings flagged as "sensitive" will be redacted, all other settings will be visible. The same authorization is required for this endpoint, meaning the user must be an admin or have MODIFYCLUSTERSETTINGS or VIEWCLUSTERSETTINGS roles to hit this API. The exception is that if the user has VIEWACTIVITY or VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED, they will see console only settings. [#139277][#139277]
- The overload dashboard on DB Console now shows only the v2 replication admission control metrics, where previously it displayed both v1 and v2 metrics. Additionally, the aggregate size of queued replication entries is now shown. [#139566][#139566]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where the error "batch timestamp T must be after replica GC threshold" could occur during a schema change backfill operation, and cause the schema change job to retry infinitely. Now this error is treated as permanent, and will cause the job to enter the failed state. [#139251][#139251]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Rpc.batch_stream_pool.enabled now defaults to false. This supersedes an earlier release note. The cluster setting is currently experimental and not listed publicly. [#139481][#139481]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<h4 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-missing-category">Missing category</h4>

- DROP INDEX can now only be run when `sql_safe_updates` are set to false. [#139505][#139505]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>
