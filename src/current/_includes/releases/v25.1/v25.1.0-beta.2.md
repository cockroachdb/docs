<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `DROP INDEX` is now labeled a [potentially unsafe SQL statement](/docs/v25.1/cockroach-sql.md#allow-potentially-unsafe-sql-statements), so it can only be run when the `sql_safe_updates` session variable or `--safe_updates` flag is set to `false`. [#139505][#139505]
- `SHOW JOBS` is now based on a new mechanism for storing information about the progress and status of running jobs. [#139230][#139230]
- `SHOW TENANT WITH REPLICATION STATUS` now includes an `ingestion_job_id` column that displays the ID of the Physical Cluster Replication (PCR) [ingestion job](/docs/v25.1/physical-cluster-replication-monitoring.md). [#139275][#139275]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Customers must pass URIs as [external connections](/docs/v25.1/create-external-connection.md) when [setting up Logical Data Replication (LDR)](/docs/v25.1/set-up-logical-data-replication.md). [#139506][#139506]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The DB Console Cluster Settings page now uses the same redaction logic as `SHOW CLUSTER SETTINGS` when the setting [`server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled`](/docs/v25.1/cluster-settings.md#setting-server-redact-sensitive-settings-enabled) is set to `true`. [#139277][#139277]
- The [Overload dashboard](/docs/v25.1/ui-overload-dashboard.md) in DB Console now displays only V2 Replication Admission Control metrics and omits their previous V2 prefix. Previously, both V1 and V2 metrics were displayed. Additionally, the aggregate size of queued replication entries is now displayed. [#139566][#139566]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where the error "batch timestamp T must be after replica GC threshold" could occur during a schema change backfill operation, and cause the schema change job to retry infinitely. Now this error is treated as permanent, and will cause the job to enter the failed state. [#139251][#139251]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The cluster setting `rpc.batch_stream_pool.enabled` now defaults to `false`. This supersedes an earlier release note. This cluster setting is experimental and is not listed as `public`. [#139481][#139481]
