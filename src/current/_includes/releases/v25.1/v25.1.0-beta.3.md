<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Reduce noise when using dynamically provisioned logging sinks.  Fixes: https://cockroachlabs.atlassian.net/browse/CLOUDOPS-8044 [#139644][#139644]
- New metrics for monitoring changefeed span-level checkpoint creation have been added: - `changefeed.checkpoint.create_nanos`, which measures the time it takes to create a changefeed checkpoint - `changefeed.checkpoint.total_bytes`, which measures the total size of a changefeed checkpoint in bytes - `changefeed.checkpoint.span_count`, which measures the number of spans in a changefeed checkpoint [#139707][#139707]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Improves the performance of the debug zip query that collects transaction_contention_events data, reducing the chances of "memory budget exceeded" or "query execution canceled due to statement timeout" errors. [#139755][#139755]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixes a bug where sometimes activating diagnostics for sql activity appears unresponsive, with no state or status update upon activating. Now, the status should always reflect that diagnosticsa are active or that a statement bundle is downloadable. [#139587][#139587]
- Previously, whenever CockroachDB collected a statement bundle when plan-gist-based matching was used, `plan.txt` file would be incomplete, and this is now fixed. The bug has been present since introduction of plan-gist-based matching feature in 23.1 but was partially addressed in 24.2 release. [#139268][#139268]
