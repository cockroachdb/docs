<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Reduced noise when using dynamically provisioned logging sinks. [#139644][#139644]
- Added new metrics for monitoring changefeed span-level checkpoint creation: 
    - `changefeed.checkpoint.create_nanos`, which measures the time it takes to create a changefeed checkpoint. 
    - `changefeed.checkpoint.total_bytes`, which measures the total size of a changefeed checkpoint in bytes. 
    - `changefeed.checkpoint.span_count`, which measures the number of spans in a changefeed checkpoint. [#139707][#139707]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Improved the performance of the debug zip query that collects `transaction_contention_events` data, which reduces the chance of `"memory budget exceeded"` or `"query execution canceled due to statement timeout"` errors. [#139755][#139755]

<h3 id="v25-1-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where sometimes activating diagnostics for SQL activity appears unresponsive, with no state or status update upon activating. Now, the status should always reflect that diagnostics are active, or that a statement bundle is downloadable. [#139587][#139587]
- Fixed a bug where the `plan.txt` file would be incomplete whenever CockroachDB collected a statement bundle with plan-gist-based matching. The bug had been present since the introduction of plan-gist-based matching feature in v23.1, but was partially addressed in v24.2. [#139268][#139268]
