<h3 id="v25-1-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `optimizer_check_input_min_row_count` session setting to control the minimum row count estimate for buffer scans of foreign key and uniqueness checks. It defaults to `0`.
 [#141374][#141374]

<h3 id="v25-1-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The **Paused Follower** graph has been removed from the **Replication Dashboard** in DB Console, as followers are no longer paused by default in CockroachDB v25.1 and later.
 [#141502][#141502]

<h3 id="v25-1-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A step in the v25.1 upgrade finalization process that requires backfilling jobs now uses locks to ensure progress, even under contention on the jobs table, preventing it from becoming stuck under heavy load.
 [#141460][#141460]
- Fixed a bug that prevented multi-table logical data replication (LDR) streams from starting on tables that contained user-defined types.
 [#141643][#141643]
- Fixed a bug where concurrent DML statements could prevent primary key changes from succeeding.
 [#141383][#141383]
- Fixed a bug that prevented automatic internal retries of transaction retry errors in implicit transactions when the `autocommit_before_ddl` session variable was enabled and the statement was a schema change.
 [#141393][#141393]
- Fixed a bug where dropping a table with a trigger using the legacy schema changer could leave an orphaned reference in the descriptor. This occurred when two tables were dependent on each other via a trigger, and the table containing the trigger was dropped.
 [#141181][#141181]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `nil pointer dereference` errors when executing statements with user-defined functions (UDFs) or certain built-in functions, such as `obj_description`.
 [#141653][#141653]
- Fixed a bug that could cause gateway nodes to panic when performing an `UPSERT` on a table with a `BOOL` primary key column and a partial index with the primary key column as the predicate expression.
 [#141822][#141822]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent `SHOW CREATE TABLE` from working if a database was offline (e.g., due to a `RESTORE` on that database).
