## v25.1.6

Release Date: April 30th, 2025

{% include releases/release-downloads-2023.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v25-1-6-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `WITH IGNORE_FOREIGN_KEYS` option to `SHOW CREATE TABLE` which omits foreign key constraints from the output schema. This option is also allowed in `SHOW CREATE VIEW`, but has no effect. It cannot be combined with the `WITH REDACT` option.
 [#142161][#142161]
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statements now display the number of transaction retries and time spent retrying, if non-zero, in the plan output.
 [#142928][#142928]
- A new `execution time` statistic is now reported on `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output for most operators. Previously, this statistic was only available on the DistSQL diagrams in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` output.
 [#143895][#143895]

<h3 id="v25-1-6-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `sys.cpu.host.combined.percent-normalized` metric has been updated to include additional counters for more accurate host CPU measurement and to reduce underreporting. It now accounts for time spent processing hardware (`irq`) and software (`softirq`) interrupts, as well as `nice` time, which represents low-priority user-mode activity.
 [#142906][#142906]
- The `server.client_cert_expiration_cache.capacity` cluster setting has been removed. The `security.certificate.expiration.client` and `security.certificate.ttl.client` metrics now report the lowest value observed for a user in the last 24 hours.
 [#143729][#143729]

<h3 id="v25-1-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, fast failback for physical cluster replication (PCR) could succeed even if the destination cluster protected timestamp had been removed, causing the reverse stream to enter a crashing loop. This fix ensures the failback command fast fails.
 [#142922][#142922]
- The reader virtual cluster now starts if the user begins a physical cluster replication (PCR) stream from a cursor via `ALTER VIRTUAL CLUSTER virtual_cluster START REPLICATION OF virtual_cluster ON physical_cluster WITH READ VIRTUAL CLUSTER`.
 [#143141][#143141]
- Fixed a bug that caused changefeeds to fail on startup when scanning a single key.
 [#143150][#143150]
- MVCC garbage collection is now fully subject to IO admission control. Previously, it was possible for MVCC GC to cause store overload (such as LSM inversion) when a large amount of data would become eligible for garbage collection. Should any issues arise from subjecting MVCC GC to admission control, the `kv.mvcc_gc.queue_kv_admission_control.enabled` cluster setting can be set to `false` to restore the previous behavior.
 [#143277][#143277]
- Fixed a bug where calling a stored procedure could drop the procedure if it had `OUT` parameters that were not used by the calling routine. This bug had existed since PL/pgSQL `CALL` statements were introduced in v24.1.
 [#143290][#143290]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would encounter an internal error when decoding the gists of plans with `CALL` statements. The bug had been present since v23.2.
 [#143315][#143315]
- Fixed a crash due to `use of enum metadata before hydration` when using logical data replication (LDR) with user-defined types.
 [#143373][#143373]
- Fixed a bug where a GC threshold error (which appears as "batch timestamp must be after replica GC threshold ...") could cause a schema change that backfills data to fail. Now, the error will cause the backfill to be retried at a higher timestamp to avoid the error.
 [#143520][#143520]
- Fixed a bug in `v24.1.14`, `v24.3.7`, `v24.3.8`, and `v25.1` that could cause a nil-pointer error when a column's default expression contained a volatile expression (like `nextval`) as a UDF argument.
 [#143634][#143634]
- Fixed a potential deadlock that could occur during client certificate updates while metrics were being collected. This issue affected the reliability of certificate expiration reporting.
 [#143729][#143729]
- Previously, the fields `maximum memory usage` and `max sql temp disk usage` in the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output could be under-reported for distributed plans when memory-intensive operations were fully performed on the remote nodes. This is now fixed. The bug existed in v22.1 and later.
 [#143794][#143794]
- The `ALTER VIRTUAL CLUSTER SET REPLICATION READ VIRTUAL CLUSTER` syntax is now supported for adding a reader virtual cluster for an existing Physical Cluster Replication (PCR) standby.
 [#143853][#143853]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could encounter a `cannot specify timestamp older than ...` error during table statistics collection in some cases (e.g., when the cluster is overloaded). The bug was present since v19.1.
 [#144018][#144018]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a stack overflow during execution of a prepared statement that invoked a PL/pgSQL routine with a loop. The bug existed in versions v23.2.22, v24.1.15, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, v25.1.3, and pre-release versions of v25.2 prior to v25.2.0-alpha.3.
 [#144031][#144031]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to a node stall.
 [#146410][#146410]

<h3 id="v25-1-6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Schema changes that require data to be backfilled no longer hold a protected timestamp for the entire duration of the backfill; this means there is less overhead caused by MVCC garbage collection after the backfill completes.
