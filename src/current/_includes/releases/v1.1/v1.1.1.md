<h3 id="v1-1-1-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- `SET CLUSTER SETTING version = '1.1'` now works correctly. You issue this command when [finalizing a cluster upgrade from 1.0.x to 1.1.1](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/upgrade-cockroach-version). [#19225](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19225)
- Created, dropped, or truncated tables no longer result in non-restorable backups. [#19067](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19067)
- Some issues that could cause non-restorable backups are now detected during the backup process. [#19286](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19286)
- Fixed a deadlock in the crash reporting code, making more information available about certain fatal errors. [#19287](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19287)
- Very large arguments to the SQL `repeat()` function now return an error instead of panicking. [#19066](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19066)
- It is now possible to drop a [foreign key constraint](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/foreign-key) on a column that is part of the primary key. [#19092](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19092)
- Attempting to use [`SHOW TRACE FOR`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-trace) while session tracing is enabled no longer turns off session tracing. [#19099](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19099)
- [`SHOW TRACE FOR`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-trace) no longer includes detailed KV-level information (these messages are included in the separate `SHOW KV TRACE FOR` command). [#19143](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19143)
