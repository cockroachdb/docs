<h3 id="v1-1-4-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- For compatibility with PostgreSQL, the `transaction isolation level`, `transaction priority`, and `transaction status` [session variables](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/set-vars) have been renamed `transaction_isolation`, `transaction_priority`, and `transaction_status`. [#20301](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20301)
- The [`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/import) statement now supports `201` and `204` return codes from HTTP storage. [#20516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20516)

<h3 id="v1-1-4-command-line-changes">Command-Line Changes</h3>

- Client [`cockroach` commands](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/cockroach-commands) that use SQL (`cockroach sql`, `cockroach node ls`, etc.) now print a warning if the server is running an older version of CockroachDB than the client. Also, this and other warning messages are now clearly indicated with the "warning:" prefix. [#20945](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20945)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client) command no longer fails when the server is running a version of CockroachDB that does not support the `sql_safe_updates` [session variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/set-vars#supported-variables). [#20945](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20945)
- The [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client) command now performs client-side syntax checking automatically only if the client and server are running the same version of CockroachDB. This restriction will be lifted in CockroachDB v2.0. [#21135](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21135)
- Reduced temporary disk space usage for the `debug compact` command. [#20502](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20502)

<h3 id="v1-1-4-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Improved rebalancing to make thrashing back and forth between nodes much less likely, including when [localities](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/start-a-node#locality) have very different numbers of nodes. [#20934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20934)
- Fixed a scenario where a range that is too big to snapshot can lose availability even with a majority of nodes alive. [#20906](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20906)
- Fixed a replica corruption that could occur if a process crashed in the middle of a range split. [#20939](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20939)
- Fixed an issue where seemingly irrelevant error messages were being returned for certain [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/insert) statements.[#20855](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20855)
- Crash details are now properly copied to the log file even when a node was started with `--logtostderr` as well as in other circumstances when crash details could be lost previously. [#20842](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20842)
- Fixed an issue where wildcards (`_`, `%`) and `` escaped characters in `LIKE` patterns were not handled properly. [#20654](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20654)
- Fixed the return type signature of the `array_positions()` [built-in function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/functions-and-operators). This caused a crash if the function was used in query execution by the distributed execution engine. [#20652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20652)
- Fixed a crash caused by null [collated strings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/collate). [#20648](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20648)
- Fixed a crash caused by `NATURAL JOINS` and `USING` in conjunction with a filter. [#20582](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20582)
- Fixed build when new versions of `libgtest` are installed. [#20598](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20598)
- Fixed a crash caused by an edge-case when queries are run against a table undergoing a schema change. [#20541](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20541)
- Fixed a race condition that would result in some queries hanging after [cancellation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/cancel-query). [#20534](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20534)
- Fixed a crash caused by some corner-case queries containing `ORDER BY`. [#20512](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20512)
- Prevented generating empty sstables at the [storage layer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/architecture/storage-layer), which could cause corruption. [#20284](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20284)
- Fixed a crash caused by [`cockroach dump`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/sql-dump) in the presence of reference cycles. [#20283](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20283)
- It is no longer possible to use conflicting `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clauses in different parts of a query. [#20286](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20286)
- Improved S3 resiliency during [`BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/backup)/[`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/restore)/[`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/import). [#21003](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21003)

<h3 id="v1-1-4-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise Edition Changes</h3>

<h3 id="v1-1-4-doc-updates">Doc Updates</h3>

- Improved the [initial steps for troubleshooting a problem](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/troubleshooting-overview), and added a list of [common errors with recommended solutions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/common-errors).
