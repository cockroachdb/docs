With the release of CockroachDB v1.1.0, weâ€™ve included support for faster migrations from other databases for developers, simplified cluster management for operators, and improved performance in real-world environments.

- Read more about these changes in the [v1.1 blog post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-1dot1/).
- Check out a [summary of backwards-incompatible changes and new features](#v1-1-0-summary).
- Then [upgrade to CockroachDB v1.1.0](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/upgrade-cockroach-version). The process of upgrading from v1.0.x to v1.1.0 is different than upgrading within the v1.0.x series, so please follow the upgrade instructions carefully.

<h3 id="v1-1-0-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

Change | Description
-------|------------
[`DROP DATABASE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/drop-database) | This statement no longer drops non-empty databases unless the `CASCADE` modifier is added.
[`cockroach start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/start-a-node) | The `--max-sql-memory` and `--cache` flags now default to 128MiB instead of 25% of physical memory. These new defaults are reasonable for local development clusters. However, for production deployments, they should be increased to 25% or higher. See [Recommended Production Settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/recommended-production-settings#cache-and-sql-memory-size-changed-in-v1-1) for more details.<br><br>Also, if the server's own hostname cannot be resolved, CockroachDB reports an error at startup instead of starting a node that will be unable to participate in a cluster. Local test clusters may need to pass `--host=localhost` to avoid this error.
[Various names](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/keywords-and-identifiers#rules-for-identifiers) | Database, table, view, and column names in double quotes are now case-sensitive (as in PostgreSQL).
[`DROP COLUMN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/drop-column) | It is no longer possible to drop columns in tables depended on by [views](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/views). This is an overly-broad change to avoid schema changes that might break views; it will be narrowed in the future.
`EXPLAIN (DEBUG)`<br>`EXPLAIN(TRACE)` | These [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/explain) options have been removed. They have been replaced by the new [`SHOW TRACE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-trace) statement.

<h3 id="v1-1-0-sql-statements">SQL Statements</h3>

Statement | Description
----------|------------
[`IMPORT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/import) | Use this new statement to import an entire table's data into a running cluster by loading CSV files.
[`SHOW QUERIES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-queries)<br>[`CANCEL QUERY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/cancel-query) | Use these new statements to monitor the progress of active queries, and, if necessary, cancel long-running queries causing unwanted resource consumption.
[`SHOW SESSIONS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-sessions) | Use this new statement to monitor the overall state of client connections and identify those that may need investigation or adjustment.
[`SHOW JOBS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-jobs) | Use this new statement to monitor the progress of schema changes and enterprise backups and restores.
[`CANCEL JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/cancel-job)<br>[`PAUSE JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/pause-job)<br>[`RESUME JOB`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/resume-job) | Use these new statements to cancel, pause, or resume enterprise backups and restores.
[`SHOW BACKUP`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-backup) | Use this new statement to list the contents of an enterprise backup.
[`SHOW TRACE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/show-trace) | Use this new statement to execute a target statement and then return a trace of its actions through all of CockroachDB's software layers.
[`DROP USER`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/drop-user) | Use this new statement to remove one or more SQL users. This features is equivalent to the existing [`cockroach user rm`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/create-and-manage-users) command.
[`RESET`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/reset-vars)<br> | Use this new statement to reset a session variable to its default value. You can also use the new [`SET .. TO DEFAULT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/set-vars#reset-a-variable-to-its-default-value) option.
[`RESET CLUSTER SETTING`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/reset-cluster-setting) | Use this new statement to reset a cluster setting to its default value. You can also use the new [`SET CLUSTER SETTING .. TO DEFAULT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/set-cluster-setting#reset-a-setting-to-its-default-value) option.
[`DROP DATABASE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/drop-database) | Use the new `CASCADE` option to drop all tables and views in a database as well as all objects that depend on those tables, such as [constraints](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/constraints) and [views](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/views). This option does not list objects it drops, so should be used cautiously.
[`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/insert#update-values-on-conflict) | Use a `WHERE` clause with `ON CONFLICT` to conditionally apply updates that conflict with a Unique constraint on one or more columns.

<h3 id="v1-1-0-sql-types">SQL Types</h3>

Type | Description
-----|------------
[`ARRAY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/array) | Use this new data type to store 1-dimensional, 1-indexed, homogeneous arrays of any non-array data type.
[`UUID`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/uuid) | Use this new data type to store 128-bit values that are globally unique. This type is recommended for [auto-generating unique row IDs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/uuid#create-a-table-with-auto-generated-unique-row-ids).

<h3 id="v1-1-0-cockroach-commands">Cockroach Commands</h3>

Command | Description
--------|------------
[`init`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/initialize-a-cluster) | Use this new command to perform a one-time initialization of a new multi-node cluster. For a full walk-through of the cluster startup and initialization process, see [Manual Deployment](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/manual-deployment) or one of the [Cloud Deployment](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/manual-deployment) tutorials.
[`node decommission`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/view-node-details)<br>[`node recommission`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/view-node-details) | Use these new subcommands of `cockroach node` to decommission nodes for permanent removal or recommission nodes that were accidentally decommissioned. See [Remove Nodes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/remove-nodes) for more details.
[`start`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/start-a-node) | When starting a node, the new `--max-disk-temp-storage` flag lets you set the maximum on-disk storage capacity available to store temporary data for SQL queries that exceed the memory budget. This ensures that JOINs, sorts, and other memory-intensive SQL operations are able to spill intermediate results to disk.
[`sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client) | When starting the built-in SQL client, the new `--echo-sql` flag reveals the SQL statements sent implicitly by the command-line utility, and the new `--unsafe-updates` flag allows potentially unsafe statements, such as `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause.<br><br>Within the interactive SQL shell, you can now get [interactive help about statements and functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client#sql-shell-help-new-in-v1-1) and you can set [new SQL shell options](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client#sql-shell-options-changed-in-v1-1) to control how table rows get printed, to reveal the statements sent implicitly by the SQL shell, to reveal the time a query takes to complete, and to return the current status of a transaction.<br><br>Also, when the built-in SQL client connects or reconnects to a node, the [welcome text](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client#sql-shell-welcome-changed-in-v1-1) it prints now includes version and cluster ID details.
[`dump`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/sql-dump) | Table and view schemas are now dumped in the order in which they can successfully be recreated.<br><br>Also, the new `--echo-sql` flag reveals the SQL statements sent implicitly by the command-line utility.
[`zone`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v1.1/configure-replication-zones) | The new `--echo-sql` flag reveals the SQL statements sent implicitly by the command-line utility.
