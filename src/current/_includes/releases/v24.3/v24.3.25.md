<h3 id="v24-3-25-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect query results when using prepared statements with NULL placeholders. The bug has existed since v21.2 and violated SQL NULL-equality semantics by returning rows with NULL values when the result set should have been empty.

    From v21.2 to v25.3, the bug occurred when all of the following were true:
    
    - The query was run with an explicit or implicit prepared statement
    - The query had an equality filter on a placeholder and a UNIQUE column
    - The column contained NULL values
    - The placeholder was assigned to NULL during execution
    
    Starting in v25.4, the requirements were loosened: the column no longer needed to be UNIQUE, and the bug could reproduce if the column was included in any index. [#159078][#159078]
- Fixed a race condition that could occur during context cancellation of an incoming snapshot. [#159538][#159538]
- Fixed a bug causing a query predicate to be ignored
  when the predicate is on a column following one or more ENUM columns in an
  index, the predicate constrains the column to multiple values, and a lookup
  join to the index is chosen for the query plan. This bug was introduced in
  24.3.0 and present in all versions since. [#159774][#159774]
