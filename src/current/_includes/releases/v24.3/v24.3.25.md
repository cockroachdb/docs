<h3 id="v24-3-25-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect query results when using prepared statements with _NULL_ placeholders. The bug has existed since v21.2 and violated SQL _NULL_-equality semantics by returning rows with _NULL_ values when the result set should have been empty. From v21.2 to v25.3, the bug occurred when all of the following were true:
    - The query was run with an explicit or implicit prepared statement
    - The query had an equality filter on a placeholder and a `UNIQUE` column
    - The column contained _NULL_ values
    - The placeholder was assigned to _NULL_ during execution
  - Starting in v25.4, the requirements to trigger the bug were loosened: the column no longer needed to be `UNIQUE`, and the bug could be reproduced if the column was included in any index. [#159078][#159078]
- Fixed a race condition that could occur during context cancellation of an incoming snapshot. [#159538][#159538]
- Fixed a bug causing a query predicate to be ignored when the predicate was on a column following one or more `ENUM` columns in an index, the predicate constrained the column to multiple values, and a lookup join to the index was chosen for the query plan. This bug was introduced in 24.3.0 and has been present in all versions since. [#159774][#159774]
