<h3 id="v24-3-7-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The `optimizer_prefer_bounded_cardinality`
  session setting has been added which instructs the optimizer to prefer
  query plans where every expression has a guaranteed upper-bound on the
  number of rows it will process. This may help the optimizer produce
  better query plans in some cases. This setting is disabled by default. [#140998][#140998]

- The `optimizer_min_row_count` session setting
  has been added which sets a lower bound on row count estimates for
  relational expressions during query planning. A value of zero, which is
  the default, indicates no lower bound. Note that if this is set to a
  value greater than zero, a row count of zero can still be estimated for
  expressions with a cardinality of zero, e.g., for a contradictory
  filter. Setting this to a value higher than 0, such as 1, may yield
  better query plans in some cases, such as when statistics are frequently
  stale and inaccurate. [#140255][#140255]

  better query plans in some cases, such as when statistics are frequently

- Since v23.2 table statistics histograms have
  been collected for non-indexed JSON columns. Histograms are no longer
  collected for these columns if `sql.stats.non_indexed_json_histograms.enabled`
  is set to `false`. This reduces memory usage during table
  statistics collection, for both automatic and manual collection via
  `ANALYZE` and `CREATE STATISTICS`. [#139897][#139897]
- The `optimizer_check_input_min_row_count`
  session setting has been added to control the minimum row count estimate
  for buffer scans of foreign key and unqiueness checks. It defaults to 0. [#141375][#141375]

  been collected for non-indexed JSON columns. Histograms are no longer
  collected for these columns if `sql.stats.non_indexed_json_histograms.enabled`
  is set to `false`. This reduces memory usage during table
  statistics collection, for both automatic and manual collection via
  `ANALYZE` and `CREATE STATISTICS`. [#140998][#140998]
- Added support for a new index hint,
  AVOID_FULL_SCAN, which will prevent the optimizer from planning a
  full scan for the specified table if any other plan is possible. The
  hint can be used in the same way as other existing index hints. For
  example, SELECT * FROM table_name@{AVOID_FULL_SCAN};. This hint is
  similar to NO_FULL_SCAN, but will not error if a full scan cannot be
  avoided. Note that normally a full scan of a partial index would not
  be considered a "full scan" for the purposes of the NO_FULL_SCAN and
  AVOID_FULL_SCAN hints, but if the user has explicitly forced the
  partial index via FORCE_INDEX=index_name, we do consider it a full
  scan. [#140255][#140255]

- Fixed a bug existing only in pre-release versions
  of v25.1 which could cause unexpected errors during planning for `VALUES`
  expressions containing function calls with multiple overloads. [#140646][#140646]

<h3 id="v24-3-7-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Reduce noise when using dynamically provisioned logging sinks.
  
  Fixes: https://cockroachlabs.atlassian.net/browse/CLOUDOPS-8044 [#139643][#139643]
- the `node decommission` cli command now waits
  until the target node is drained before marking it as fully
  decommissioned. Previously, it would start drain but not wait, leaving
  the target node briefly in a state where it would be unable to
  communicate with the cluster but would still accept client requests
  (which would then hang or hit unexpected errors). [#139556][#139556]

<h3 id="v24-3-7-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Improves the performance of the debug zip query that collects
  transaction_contention_events data, reducing the chances of "memory budget exceeded" or "query
  execution canceled due to statement timeout" errors. [#139754][#139754]

<h3 id="v24-3-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause SHOW TABLES and
  other introspection operations to encounter a "batch timestamp
  must be after replica GC threshold" error. [#140084][#140084]
- Fixed a bug that could cause SHOW TABLES and
  other introspection operations to encounter a "batch timestamp
  must be after replica GC threshold" error. [#140284][#140284]
- Fixed a bug where dropping a table with a
  trigger using the legacy schema changer could leave an orphaned
  reference in the descriptor. This occurred when two tables were
  dependent on each other via a trigger, and the table containing the
  trigger was dropped. [#141179][#141179]
- Fixed a bug that could cause SHOW TABLES and
  other introspection operations to encounter a "batch timestamp
  must be after replica GC threshold" error. [#141720][#141720]
- Fixes a bug where sometimes activating
  diagnostics for sql activity appears unresponsive, with no
  state or status update upon activating. Now, the status should
  always reflect that diagnosticsa are active or that a statement
  bundle is downloadable. [#139585][#139585]
- Fixed a bug that would cause an internal error
  when the result of a RECORD-returning UDF was wrapped by another expression
  (such as COALESCE) within a VALUES clause. [#140646][#140646]
- We have resolved an issue in the Kafka v2 sink
  configuration within CockroachDB, where users were previously unable to
  set negative GZIP compression levels. Now, users can configure the
  CompressionLevel for the Kafka sink in the range of [-2, 9]. Please
  update the user guide to include the new valid GZIP compression level
  range of [-2, 9], where -2 enables Huffman encoding and -1 sets the
  default compression. [#141037][#141037]
- Bounded memory leak that could previously occur
  when evaluating some memory-intensive queries via the vectorized engine
  in CockroachDB has now been fixed. The leak has been present since 20.2
  version. [#139095][#139095]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent SHOW CREATE TABLE
  from working if a database was offline (e.g., due to a RESTORE on that
  database). [#141509][#141509]
- Data distribution page in
  advanced debug will no longer crash if there are null
  values for `raw_sql_config` in `crdb_internal.zones`. [#140661][#140661]
- Fixed possible index corruption caused by triggers
  that could occur when the following conditions were satisfied:
  1. A query calls a UDF or stored procedure, and also performs a mutation
     on a table.
  2. The UDF/SP contains a statement that either fires an AFTER trigger, or
     fires a cascade that itself fires a trigger.
  3. The trigger modifies the same row as the outer statement.
  4. Either the outer or inner mutation is something other than an INSERT
     without an `ON CONFLICT` clause. [#138361][#138361]
- Fix a rare bug in which a query might fail with
  error "could not find computed column expression for column in table"
  while dropping a virtual computed column from the table. This bug was
  introduced in v23.2.4. [#139833][#139833]
- fix a bug that prevented starting multi-table LDR streams on tables that used user-defined types.
  Epic: none.
  
  Fixes #141598. [#141793][#141793]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause "nil
  pointer dereference" errors when executing statements with UDFs. The
  error could also occur when executing statements with some built-in
  functions, like obj_description. [#141652][#141652]
- Removes duplicate columns in the parquet
  output from changefeeds using cdc queries. [#140153][#140153]
