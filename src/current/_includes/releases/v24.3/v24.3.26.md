<h3 id="v24-3-26-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where IMPORT with AVRO data using OCF format could silently lose data if the underlying storage (e.g., S3) returned an error during read. Such errors are now properly reported. Other formats (specified via `data_as_binary_records` and `data_as_json_records` options) are unaffected. The bug has been present since about v20.1. [#161321][#161321]
