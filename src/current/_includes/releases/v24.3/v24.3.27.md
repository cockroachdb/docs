<h3 id="v24-3-27-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where generating a debug zip could trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition on a node if malformed log entries were present in logs using json or json-compact formatting. Debug zip generation now safely handles malformed log lines and prevents excessive memory consumption. [#163800][#163800]
