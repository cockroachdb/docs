<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- If a table is the destination of a logical data replication stream, then only schema change statements that are deemed safe are allowed on the table. Safe statements are those that do not result in a rebuild of the primary [index]({% link v24.3/indexes.md %}) and do not create an index on a virtual [computed column]({% link v24.3/computed-columns.md %}). [#133266][#133266]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The two new metrics `sql.crud_query.count` and `sql.crud_query.started.count` measure the number of [`INSERT`]({% link v24.3/insert.md %})/[`UPDATE`]({% link v24.3/update.md %})/[`DELETE`]({% link v24.3/delete.md %})/[`SELECT`]({% link v24.3/selection-queries.md %}) queries executed and started respectively. [#133198][#133198]
- When creating a logical data replication stream, any [user-defined types]({% link v24.3/create-type.md %}) in the source and destination are now checked for equivalency. This allows for creating a stream that handles user-defined types without needing to use the `WITH SKIP SCHEMA CHECK` option as long as the stream uses `mode = immediate`. [#133274][#133274]
- Logical data replication streams that reference tables with [user-defined types]({% link v24.3/create-type.md %}) can now be created with the `mode = immediate` option. [#133295][#133295]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [**SQL Statements**]({% link v24.3/ui-overview-dashboard.md %}#sql-statements) graph on the [**Overview**]({% link v24.3/ui-overview-dashboard.md %}) and [**SQL**]({% link v24.3/ui-sql-dashboard.md %}) dashboard pages in DB Console now show **Total Queries** as a general Queries Per Second (QPS) metric. [#133198][#133198]
- Due to the inaccuracy of the **Range Count** column on the [**Databases** page]({% link v24.3/ui-databases-page.md %}) and the cost incurred to fetch the correct range count for every database in a cluster, this data will no longer be visible. This data is still available via a [`SHOW RANGES`]({% link v24.3/show-ranges.md %}) query. [#133267][#133267]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Users with the [`admin` role]({% link v24.3/security-reference/authorization.md %}#admin-role) can now run [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR target_role ...`]({% link v24.3/alter-default-privileges.md %}) on any `target_role`. Previously, this could result in a privilege error, which is incorrect as `admin`s are allowed to perform any operation. [#133072][#133072]
- [`REASSIGN OWNED BY current_owner_role ...`]({% link v24.3/reassign-owned.md %}) will now transfer ownership of the `public` schema. Previously, it would always skip over the `public` schema even if it was owned by the `current_owner_role`. [#133072][#133072]
