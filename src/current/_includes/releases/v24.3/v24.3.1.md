## v24.3.1

Release Date: December 12, 2024

{% include releases/release-downloads-2023.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-3-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- When triggers fire one another cyclically, the new `recursion_depth_limit` setting now limits the depth of the recursion. By default, the limit is `1000` nested trigger executions. [#135046][#135046]

<h3 id="v24-3-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The metrics scrape HTTP endpoint at `/ _status/vars` will now truncate HELP text at the first sentence, reducing the metadata for metrics with large descriptions. Customers can still access these descriptions via our docs. [#135021][#135021]
- The row-level TTL job now periodically updates the progress meter in the jobs introspection interfaces, including `SHOW JOBS` and the Jobs page in the DB console. [#135171][#135171]
- Telemetry delivery is now considered successful even in cases where we experience a network timeout. This will prevent throttling in cases outside an operator's control. [#136481][#136481]

<h3 id="v24-3-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- When activating statement diagnostics in the DB Console, users now have the option to produce a redacted bundle as output. This bundle will omit sensitive data. [#134993][#134993]

<h3 id="v24-3-1-other">Other changes</h3>

- Protected timestamp records for changefeeds now include the `system.users` table. This ensures that user information remains available when running CDC queries against historical data. [#134238][#134238]

<h3 id="v24-3-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause `DELETE` triggers not to fire on cascading delete, and which could cause `INSERT` triggers to match incorrectly in the same scenario. [#134896][#134896]
- Reduced the duration of partitions in the gossip network when a node crashes in order to eliminate false positives in the `ranges.unavailable` metric. [#134480][#134480]
- When a non-admin user runs `DROP ROLE IF EXISTS` on a user that does not exist, an error is no longer returned. [#134970][#134970]
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect query results when the optimizer planned a lookup join on an index containing a column of type `CHAR(N)`, `VARCHAR(N)`, `BIT(N)`, `VARBIT(N)`, or `DECIMAL(M, N)`, and the query held that column constant to a single value (e.g. with an equality filter). [#135037][#135037]
- Fixed an unhandled error that would occur if `DROP SCHEMA` was executed on the `public` schema of the `system` database, or on an internal schema like `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. [#135181][#135181]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect evaluation of some binary expressions involving `CHAR(N)` values and untyped string literals with trailing whitespace characters. For example, the expression `'f'::CHAR = 'f '` now correctly evaluates to `true`. [#134710][#134710]
- Prevent `ALTER DATABASE` operations that modify the zone config from hanging if an invalid zone config already exists. [#135216][#135216]
- `CREATE SCHEMA` now returns the correct error if a schema name is missing. [#135928][#135928]
- `percentile_cont` and `percentile_disc` aggregate functions now support `float4` data type inputs. Previously, these functions would return an error when used with `float4` values. [#135764][#135764]
- `security.certificate.*` metrics now update correctly when certificates are reloaded during node runtime. Previously, these metrics would not reflect changes to certificates after node startup. [#136227][#136227]
- SQL roles created from LDAP groups that contain periods (.) or hyphens (-) in their Common Names (CN) no longer result in authorization failures. [#134942][#134942]
- LDAP authorization now supports partial group mapping, allowing users to authenticate even when some LDAP groups do not have corresponding CockroachDB roles. Previously, authentication would fail if any LDAP group lacked a matching database role. [#135587][#135587]
- Regional by row tables with uniqueness constraints where the region is not part of those uniqueness constraints and which also contain non-unique indices will now have those constraints properly enforced when modified at `READ COMMITTED` isolation. This bug was introduced in v24.3.0. [#137367][#137367]

<h3 id="v24-3-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The `_status/nodes_ui` API no longer returns unnecessary metrics in its response. This decreases the payload size of the API and improves the load time of various DB Console pages and components. [#135209][#135209]
- PL/pgSQL loops now execute up to 3-4x faster through improved optimization, particularly when they contain subqueries. This enhancement improves performance for routines with many iterations or nested operations. [#135648][#135648]
