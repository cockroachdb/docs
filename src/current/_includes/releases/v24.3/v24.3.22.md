<h3 id="v24-3-22-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in the `cockroach node drain` command where draining a node using virtual clusters (such as clusters running Physical Cluster Replication (PCR)) could return before the drain was complete, possibly resulting in shutting down the node while it still had active SQL clients and range leases.
