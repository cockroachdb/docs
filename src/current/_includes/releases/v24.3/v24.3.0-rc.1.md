<h3 id="v24-3-0-rc-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- All cluster settings that accept strings are now fully redacted when transmitted as part of CockroachDB's diagnostics telemetry. This payload includes a record of modified cluster settings and their values when they are not strings. Customers who previously applied the mitigations in Technical Advisory 133479 can safely set the value of cluster setting `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` to false and turn on diagnostic reporting via the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` cluster setting without leaking sensitive cluster settings values. [#134018][#134018]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-rc-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Row-level `AFTER` triggers can now be executed in response to mutations on a table. Row-level `AFTER` triggers fire after checks and cascades have completed for the query. [#133320][#133320]
- Cascades can now execute row-level `BEFORE` triggers. By default, attempting to modify or eliminate the cascading `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation results in a `Triggered Data Change Violation` error. To bypass this error, you can set the `unsafe_allow_triggers_modifying_cascades` query option to `true`. This could result in constraint violations. [#134444][#134444]
- String constants can now be compared with collated strings. [#134086][#134086]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-rc-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `kvadmission.low_pri_read_elastic_control.enabled` cluster setting has been removed, because all bulk requests are now subject to elastic admission control admission by default. [#134486][#134486]
- The following metrics have been added for Logic Data Replication (LDR):
  - `logical_replication.catchup_ranges`: the number of source side ranges conducting catchup scans.
  - `logical_replication.scanning_ranges`: the number source side ranges conducting initial scans.
  - In the DB Console, these metrics may not be accurate if multiple LDR jobs are running. The metrics are accurate when exported from the Prometheus endpoint. [#134674][#134674]
- The backup and restore syntax update of `cockroach workload` which was introduced in [#134610][#134610] #has been reverted. [#134645][#134645]


<h3 id="v24-3-0-rc-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- After finalizing an upgrade to v24.3, an updated version of the **Databases** page will be available. [#134244][#134244]
- Users with the `CONNECT` privilege can now access the **Databases** page. [#134542][#134542]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-rc-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an LDAP connection would be closed by the server and would not be retried by CockroachDB. [#134277]
- Fixed a bug that prevented LDAP authorization from successfully assigning CockroachDB roles to users when the source group name contained periods or hyphens. [#134944][#134944]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.2 that could cause significantly increased query latency while executing queries with index or lookup joins when the ordering needs to be maintained [#134367][#134367]
- Fixed a bug where `UPSERT` statements on regional by row tables under non-serializable isolations would not display show uniqueness constraints in `EXPLAIN` output. Even when not displayed, the constraints were enforced. [#134267][#134267]
- Fixed a bug where uniqueness constraints constraints enforced with tombstone writes were not shown in the output of `EXPLAIN (OPT)`. [#134482][#134482]
- Fixed a bug where `DISCARD ALL` statements were erroneously counted under the `sql.ddl.count` metric instead of the `sql.misc.count` metric. [#134510][#134510]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a backup or restore operation on AWS to fail with a KMS error due to a missing `default` shared config. [#134536][#134536]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a user from running schema change operations on a restored table that was previously apart of a Logic Data Replication (LDR) stream. [#134675][#134675]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-rc-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The optimizer now generates more efficient query plans involving inverted indexes for queries with a conjunctive filter on the same JSON or ARRAY column. For example:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SELECT * FROM t WHERE j->'a' = '10' AND j->'b' = '20'
    ~~~

    [#134002][#134002]
