    <p class="feature-description">
      Physical cluster replication (PCR) has been enhanced to support workload isolation, which enables read workflows to take advantage of a standby cluster to scale read performance. Users can now run <code>SELECT</code> operations on secondary clusters for non-critical operations.

     <p class="feature-summary">Logical Data Replication in Preview</p>
     <p class="feature-description">
      Logical data replication (LDR) continuously replicates tables between an active source CockroachDB cluster to an active destination CockroachDB cluster. Both source and destination can receive application reads and writes, and participate in bidirectional LDR replication for eventual consistency in the replicating tables. The active-active setup between clusters can provide protection against cluster, datacenter, or region failure while still achieving single-region low latency reads and writes in the individual CockroachDB clusters. Each cluster in an LDR job still benefits individually from multi-active availability with CockroachDB's built-in Raft replication providing data consistency across nodes, zones, and regions. This feature is in Preview.
