<h4 id="v24-3-0-key-cluster-setting-changes">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

Changes to [cluster settings]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}) should be reviewed prior to upgrading. New default cluster setting values will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by running the SQL statement `SELECT * FROM system.settings` to view the non-default settings.

- [Settings added](#v24-3-0-settings-added)
- [Settings with changed defaults](#v24-3-0-settings-with-changed-defaults)
- [Settings with changed visibility](#v24-3-0-settings-with-changed-visibility)
- [Additional setting changes](#v24-3-0-additional-cluster-setting-changes)

<h5 id="v24-3-0-settings-added">Settings added</h5>

- `goschedstats.always_use_short_sample_period.enabled`: when set to `true`, helps to prevent unnecessary queueing due to CPU [admission control]({% link v24.3/admission-control.md %}) by forcing `1ms` sampling of runnable queue lengths. The default value is `false`. [#133585][#133585]

- `kv.range.range_size_hard_cap`: allows you to limit how large a [range]({% link v24.3/architecture/overview.md %}#architecture-range) can grow before [backpressure]({% link v24.3/common-errors.md %}#split-failed-while-applying-backpressure-are-rows-updated-in-a-tight-loop) is applied. This can help to mitigate against a situation where a range cannot be split, such as when a range is comprised of a single key due to an issue with the schema or workload pattern, or a bug in client application code. The default is `8 GiB`, 16 times the default maximum range size. If you have changed the maximum range size, you may need to adjust this cluster setting or reduce the range size. [#129450][#129450]

- `kvadmission.flow_controller.token_reset_epoch`: can be used to refill replication [admission control]({% link v24.3/admission-control.md %}) v2 tokens. This setting is marked as `reserved`, as it is not supported for tuning, by default. Use it only after consultation with your account team. [#133294][#133294]

- `kvadmission.store.snapshot_ingest_bandwidth_control.enabled`: enables a new [Admission Control]({% link v24.3/admission-control.md %}) integration for pacing snapshot ingest traffic based on disk bandwidth. It requires provisioned bandwidth to be set for the store, or the cluster through the setting `kvadmission.store.provisioned_bandwidth`, for it to take effect. [#131243][#131243]

- Settings have been added which control the refresh behavior for the cached data in the Databases page of the [DB Console]({% link v24.3/ui-overview.md %}):
    - `obs.tablemetadatacache.data_valid_duration`: the duration for which the data in `system.table_metadata` is considered valid before a cache reset will occur. Default: 20 minutes.
    - `obs.tablemetadatacache.automatic_updates.enabled`: whether to automatically update the cache according the validity interval. Default: `false`.
  
    [#130198][#130198]

- `server.jwt_authentication.client.timeout`: the HTTP client timeout for external calls made during [JWT authentication]({% link v24.3/sso-sql.md %}). [#127145][#127145]

- Partial [statistics]({% link v24.3/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#table-statistics) can now be automatically collected at the extremes of indexes when a certain fraction and minimum number of rows are stale (by default 5% and 100%, respectively). These can be configured with new [table storage parameters]({% link v24.3/alter-table.md %}#set-and-reset-storage-parameters) and [cluster settings]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}):
    - `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection.enabled` (table parameter `sql_stats_automatic_partial_collection_enabled`) - both default to `false`.
    - `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection.min_stale_rows` (table parameter `sql_stats_automatic_partial_collection_min_stale_rows`) - both default to `100`.
    - `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection.fraction_stale_rows` (table parameter `sql_stats_automatic_partial_collection_fraction_stale_rows`) - both default to `0.05`.

    [#93067][#93067]

- `sql.stats.histogram_buckets.include_most_common_values.enabled`: controls whether common values are included in [histogram collection]({% link v24.3/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#control-histogram-collection) for use by the [optimizer]({% link v24.3/cost-based-optimizer.md %}). When enabled, histogram buckets will represent the most common sampled values as upper bounds. [#129378][#129378]

- `sql.stats.histogram_buckets.max_fraction_most_common_values`: controls the fraction of buckets that can be adjusted to include common values. Defaults to `0.1`. [#129378][#129378]

- `sql.txn.repeatable_read_isolation.enabled`: defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, the following statements configure transactions to run under `REPEATABLE READ` isolation, rather than being automatically interpreted as [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link v24.3/demo-serializable.md %}):
  - `BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ`
  - `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ`
  - `SET default_transaction_isolation = 'repeatable read'`
  - `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ`

<h5 id="v24-3-0-settings-with-changed-defaults">Settings with changed defaults</h5>

- The default for `sql.defaults.large_full_scan_rows` is now `0`. If a user is using session var values inherited from these settings, when `sql.defaults.disallow_full_table_scans.enabled` is set to `true`: all full table scans are now disallowed by default, even full scans on very small tables, but if `sql.defaults.large_full_scan_rows` is set to a number greater than `0`, full scans are allowed if they are estimated to read fewer than that number of rows. 
  - **Note:** All `sql.defaults` settings are maintained for backward compatibility. We recommend using `ALTER ROLE`, instead, to set the corresponding session vars for users (in this case, `large_full_scan_rows` and `disallow_full_table_scans`). For more information, see the note on the [Cluster Settings table]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}#settings).

- Increased the per-vCPU concurrency limits for KV operations:
    - The default for `kv.dist_sender.concurrency_limit` (reserved) has changed from `64` per vCPU to `384` perÂ vCPU. (In v24.3, it is possible to estimate the current concurrency level using the new metric `distsender.batches.async.in_progress`.)
    - The default for `kv.streamer.concurrency_limit` (reserved) has changed from `8` per vCPU to `96` per vCPU.
    - These are `reserved` settings, not intended for tuning by customers.
    - When running `SHOW CLUSTER SETTING`, the displayed setting values will depend on the node's number of vCPUs.
    - Contact Support if the number of `distsender.batches.async.throttled` requests is  persistently greater than zero.

    [#131226][#131226]

- The default for `server.oidc_authentication.client.timeout`, which sets the client timeout for external calls made during OIDC authentication, has changed from `30s` to `15s`.

<h5 id="v24-3-0-settings-with-changed-visibility">Settings with changed visibility</h5>

The following settings are now marked `public` after previously being `reserved`. Reserved settings are not documented and their tuning by customers is not supported.

- Cluster settings for configuring [rate limiting for traffic to cloud storage]({% link v24.3/backup.md %}#cluster-settings-for-cloud-storage) are now public.
  - These settings have the prefix `cloudstorage` followed by:
      1. a provider or protocol (`azure`, `gs`, `s3`, `http`, `nodelocal`, `userfile`, or `nullsink`)
      1. `read` or `write`
      1. `node_burst_limit` or `node_rate_limit`
  - For example, `cloudstorage.s3.write.node_burst_limit`. [#127207][#127207]

- JWT authentication  have been made `public`. [#128170][#128170]
    - `server.jwt_authentication.audience`
    - `server.jwt_authentication.claim`
    - `server.jwt_authentication.enabled`
    - `server.jwt_authentication.issuers.custom_ca`
    - `server.jwt_authentication.jwks`
    - `server.jwt_authentication.jwks_auto_fetch.enabled`

- Settings with the prefix `server.ldap_authentication` have been made `public` with the Preview release of LDAP support: 
  - `server.ldap_authentication.client.tls_certificate`
  - `server.ldap_authentication.client.tls_key`
  - `server.ldap_authentication.domain.custom_ca`

<h5 id="v24-3-0-additional-cluster-setting-changes">Additional cluster setting changes</h5>

- The setting `server.host_based_authentication.configuration` now supports LDAP configuration, and its value is now redacted for non-admin users when the `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` is set to `true`. [#131150][#131150]

- The settings [`enterprise.license`]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-enterprise-license) and [`diagnostics.reporting.enabled`]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-diagnostics-reporting-enabled) now have additional validation. To disable diagnostics reporting, the cluster must also have a license that is not an [{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} Trial or {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} Free license]({% link v24.3/licensing-faqs.md %}#types-of-licenses). Additionally, to set one of these licenses, the cluster must already be submitting diagnostics information. [#131097][#131097] [#132257][#132257]

- `sql.defaults.vectorize` now supports the value `1` (in addition to `0` and `2`) to indicate `on`, to address a bug that could cause new connections to fail after an upgrade with a message referencing an `invalid value for parameter "vectorize": "unknown(1)"`. [#133371][#133371]

- The description of the setting [`changefeed.sink_io_workers`]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-changefeed-sink-io-workers) has been updated to reflect all of the [sinks]({% link v24.3/changefeed-sinks.md %}) that support the setting: the batching versions of webhook, pubsub, and kafka sinks that are enabled by `changefeed.new_<sink type>_sink_enabled`.
