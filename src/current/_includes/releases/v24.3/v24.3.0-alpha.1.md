Release Date: October 2, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- URLs in the following SQL statements are now sanitized of any secrets before being written to unredacted logs: - `CREATE CHANGEFEED` - `CREATE SCHEDULE FOR CHANGEFEED` [#126970][#126970]
- Cluster settings for LDAP cluster settings `server.ldap_authentication.client.tls_certificate` and `server.ldap_authentication.client.tls_key` don't have callbacks installed to reload the settings value for LDAP authManager. This change fixes this by adding the necessary callbacks. [#131151][#131151]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Avoid logging unnecessary stack traces while executing scheduled jobs. [#129846][#129846]
- Upgrading to 24.3 is blocked if no license is installed, or if a trial/free license is installed with telemetry disabled. [#130576][#130576]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added CompressionLevel option to kafka_sink_config. Changefeed will use this compression level when emitting events. The possible values depend on a compression codec. This option is useful for choosing between faster or better compression. [#125456][#125456]
- The v2 kafka sink now supports specifying compression levels. [#127827][#127827]
- A new public cluster setting server.jwt_authentication.client.timeout has been introduced to capture the HTTP client timeout for external calls made during JWT authentication. [#127145][#127145]
- The JWT auth cluster settings have been made public. [#128170][#128170]
- Update certain error messages to refer to the "stable" docs tree rather than an explicit version.  Fixes: #128611 [#128842][#128842]
- Disambiguate metrics and logs for the 2 buffers used by the kv feed. Affected metrics now have a suffix indicating which buffer they correspond to. Affected metrics: `changefeed.buffer_entries.*`, `changefeed.buffer_entries_mem.*`, `changefeed.buffer_pushback_nanos.*`. The old versions are kept around for backwards compatibility, though their use is not recommended. [#128813][#128813]
- Only update the PTS if `changefeed.protect_timestamp.lag` has passed between the last PTS and the changefeed high watermark. [#129442][#129442]
- We add support for authorization to CRDB cluster via LDAP, retrieving AD groups membership information for LDAP user. The new HBA conf cluster setting option `ldapgrouplistfilter` performs filtered search query on LDAP for matching groups.  Example hba conf entry to support LDAP authZ configuration: ```  # TYPE    DATABASE      USER           ADDRESS             METHOD             OPTIONS  # Allow all users to connect to using LDAP authentication with search and bind    host    all           all            all                 ldap               ldapserver=ldap.example.com ldapport=636 "ldapbasedn=ou=users,dc=example,dc=com" "ldapbinddn=cn=readonly,dc=example,dc=com" ldapbindpasswd=readonly_password ldapsearchattribute=uid "ldapsearchfilter=(memberof=cn=cockroachdb_users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)" "ldapgrouplistfilter=(objectClass=groupOfNames)"  # Fallback to password authentication for the root user    host    all           root           0.0.0.0/0          password ``` Example to use for azure AD server: ``` SET cluster setting server.host_based_authentication.configuration = 'host    all           all            all                 ldap ldapserver=azure.dev ldapport=636 "ldapbasedn=OU=AADDC Users,DC=azure,DC=dev" "ldapbinddn=CN=Some User,OU=AADDC Users,DC=azure,DC=dev" ldapbindpasswd=my_pwd ldapsearchattribute=sAMAccountName "ldapsearchfilter=(memberOf=CN=azure-dev-domain-sync-users,OU=AADDC Users,DC=crlcloud,DC=dev)" "ldapgrouplistfilter=(objectCategory=CN=Group,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=crlcloud,DC=dev)" host    all           root           0.0.0.0/0          password'; ```  Post configuration CRDB cluster should be able to authorize users via LDAP server if: 1. Users LDAP authentication attempt is successful, and it has the user's DN for LDAP server. 2. `ldapgrouplistfilter` is properly configured, and it successfully syncs groups of the user. [#128498][#128498]
- Adds changefeed support for the mvcc_timestamp option with the avro format. If both options are specified, the avro schema includes an mvcc_timestamp metadata field and emits the row's mvcc timestamp with the row data. [#129840][#129840]
- Updates the cluster setting `changefeed.sink_io_workers` with all the sinks that support the setting. [#129946][#129946]
- Added network metrics to the pubsub sinks. [#130434][#130434]
- Added network metrics to webhook sinks. [#130428][#130428]
- Added network metrics to the kafka v1 sink. [#130424][#130424]
- Added network metrics to the sql sink. [#130516][#130516]
- A new `changefeed.total_ranges` metric has been added and can be used to monitor the number of ranges that are watched by changefeed aggregators. It shares the same polling interval as `changefeed.lagging_ranges`, which is controlled by the existing `lagging_ranges_polling_interval` option. [#130897][#130897]
- A new LDAP authentication method has been added to complement password based login for db console if HBA configuration has an entry for LDAP for the user attempting login, along with other matching criteria (like the requests originating IP address) for authentication to db console. [#130418][#130418]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a session setting, `optimizer_use_merged_partial_statistics`, which can be set to true to enable usage of existing partial statistics merged with full statistics when optimizing a query, which is disabled by default. [#126948][#126948]
- The `enable_create_stats_using_extremes` session setting is now true by default. Partial statistics at extremes can be collected using the `CREATE STATISTICS <stat_name> ON <column_name> FROM <table_name> USING EXTREMES` syntax. [#127850][#127850]
- Added SHOW SCHEMAS WITH COMMENT and SHOW SCHEMAS FROM databasename WITH COMMENT functionality similar to show tables and show databases. [#127816][#127816]
- The deadlock_timeout session variable is now supported. The configuration can be used to specify the time to wait on a lock before pushing the lock holder for deadlock detection. It can be set at session granularity. [#128506][#128506]
- Partial stats at extremes can now be collected on all valid columns of a table using the `CREATE STATISTICS <stat_name>` `FROM <table_name> USING EXTREMES` syntax, without an `ON <col_name>` clause. Valid columns are all single column prefixes of a forward index excluding partial, sharded, and implicitly partitioned indexes. [#127836][#127836]
- Partial statistics can now be automatically collected at the extremes of indexes when a certain fraction and minimum number of rows are stale (5% and 100 by default). These can be configured with new table and cluster settings, and the feature is disabled by default. The new cluster and table settings are:  - `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection .enabled`/`sql_stats_automatic_partial_collection_enabled`   - Defaults to `false` - `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection .min_stale_rows`/`sql_stats_automatic_partial_collection_min_stale_rows`   - Defaults to `100` - `sql.stats.automatic_partial_collection .fraction_stale_rows `/`sql_stats_automatic_partial_collection_fraction_stale_rows`   - Defaults to `0.05` [#93067][#93067]
- Session variable `enforce_home_region_follower_reads_enabled` is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. (Note that related session variable `enforce_home_region` is _not_ deprecated.) [#129024][#129024]
- Added a new cluster setting to control whether most common values are collected as part of histogram collection for use by the optimizer. The setting is called sql.stats.histogram_buckets.include_most_common_values.enabled. When enabled, the histogram collection logic will ensure that the most common sampled values are represented as histogram bucket upper bounds. Since histograms in CockroachDB track the number of elements equal to the upper bound in addition to the number of elements less, this allows the optimizer to identify the most common values in the histogram and better estimate the rows processed by a query plan. To set the number of most common values to include in a histogram, a second setting sql.stats.histogram_buckets.max_fraction_most_common_values was added. Currently, the default is 0.1, or 10% of the number of buckets. So with a 200 bucket histogram, by default, at most 20 buckets may be adjusted to include a most common value (or "heavy hitter") as the upper bound. [#129378][#129378]
- This adds a new column to `crdb_internal.table_spans` to indicate whether a table is dropped. Rows for dropped tables will be removed once they are garbage collected. [#128788][#128788]
- The cluster setting sql.txn.repeatable_read_isolation.enabled was added and defaults to false. When set to true, the following statements will configure transactions to run under REPEATABLE READ isolation, rather than being automatically interpreted as SERIALIZABLE. - BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ - SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ - SET default_transaction_isolation = 'repeatable read' - SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ  This setting was added since REPEATABLE READ transactions are a preview feature, so usage of it is opt-in for v24.3. In a future CockroachDB major version, this setting will change to default to true. [#130089][#130089]
- Unify the age filter of commands "SHOW JOBS" and "SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS". [#127584][#127584]
- Set the default for session variable `large_full_scan_rows` to 0. This means that by default, `disallow_full_table_scans` will disallow _all_ full table scans, even full scans on very small tables. If `large_full_scan_rows` is set > 0, `disallow_full_table_scans` will allow full scans estimated to read fewer than `large_full_scan_rows`. [#131040][#131040]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Add eventlog events for disk slowness detected and disk slowness cleared on a store. [#127025][#127025]
- The cluster settings for rate-limiting traffic to cloud storage are included in the public documentation. [#127207][#127207]
- Verbose logging of slow pebble reads is no longer enabled via --vmodule=pebble_logger_and_tracer=2, where pebble_logger_and_tracer contains the CockroachDB implementation of the logger needed by Pebble, and instead requires listing the Pebble files containing the log statements, specifically --vmodule=reader=2,table=2. [#127066][#127066]
- Adds three new network tracking metrics. `rpc.connection.connected` is the number of rRPC TCP level connections established to remote nodes. `rpc.client.bytes.egress` is the number of TCP bytes sent via gRPC on connections we initiated. `rpc.client.bytes.ingress` is the number of TCP bytes received via gRPC on connections we initiated. [#126150][#126150]
- Adds a new configuration parameters server.cidr_mapping_url which maps IPv4 CIDR blocks to arbitrary tag names. [#128707][#128707]
- Modifies metrics sql.bytesin and sql.bytesout to be agg metrics if child metrics are enabled. [#128707][#128707]
- New clusters that are initialized for the first time will now have a zone config defined for the `timeseries` range. This zone config only specifies the gc.ttlseconds, so all the other attributes are inherited from the zone config of the `default` range, as they were before.  Clusters that are upgraded to v24.3 from a previous version will also have this zone configuration applied to the timeseries range, as long as that range does not already have a zone config. [#128032][#128032]
- This patch introduces a new cluster setting, `kv.range.range_size_hard_cap`, which provides a hard cap on how large we'll let a range get before applying backpressure. It's defaulted to 8 GB, which is 16 times the default max range size. Users who have manually changed the max range size >= 8 GB may either have to increase this cap or reduce their range size. [#129450][#129450]
- The lowest admission control priority for the storage layer has been renamed from 'ttl-low-pri' to 'bulk-low-pri' in a handful of metrics.  Epic: none. [#129564][#129564]
- New `kvflowcontrol` metrics are added, replacing existing admission flow control metrics after finalizing upgrading to 25.1. The metric mapping is as follows:  ``` kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_tokens_available     -> kvflowcontrol.tokens.eval.(regular|elastic).available kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_tokens_deducted      -> kvflowcontrol.tokens.eval.(regular|elastic).deducted kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_tokens_returned      -> kvflowcontrol.tokens.eval.(regular|elastic).returned kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_tokens_unaccounted   -> kvflowcontrol.tokens.eval.(regular|elastic).unaccounted kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_stream_count         -> kvflowcontrol.streams.eval.(regular|elastic).total_count kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_blocked_stream_count -> kvflowcontrol.streams.eval.(regular|elastic).blocked_count kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_requests_waiting     -> kvflowcontrol.eval_wait.(regular|elastic).requests.waiting kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_requests_admitted    -> kvflowcontrol.eval_wait.(regular|elastic).requests.admitted kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_requests_errored     -> kvflowcontrol.eval_wait.(regular|elastic).requests.errored kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_requests_bypassed    -> kvflowcontrol.eval_wait.(regular|elastic).requests.bypassed kvadmission.flow_controller.(regular|elastic)_wait_duration        -> kvflowcontrol.eval_wait.(regular|elastic).duration ``` [#130167][#130167]
- The `ranges.decommissioning` metric is added, representing the number of ranges which have a replica on a decommissioning node. [#130117][#130117]
- This commit adds two metrics changefeed.network.bytes_in and changefeed.network.bytes_out. These metrics track the number of bytes sent by the individual changefeeds to different sinks. [#129151][#129151]
- New cluster settings have been added which control the refresh behaviour for the cached data shown in the db pages in db console. - `obs.tablemetadatacache.data_valid_duration` non-negative duration setting, which specifies the duration for which the data in system.table_metadata is considered valid. If the cache's last update time  exceeds this threshold, users visiting the db pages will trigger a cache refresh. Default 20m.  - `obs.tablemetadatacache.automatic_updates.enabled` enables the cache to be automatically updated according the validity interval. Default false. [#130198][#130198]
- New metrics which expose the ttl for various certificates [#130110][#130110]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Tsdump to include all the available resolutions in the time range supplied by the user [#127186][#127186]
- A new flag, `--tenant-name-scope`, has been added to the `cert create-client` command. This allows users to generate tenant-scoped client certificates using tenant names in addition to tenant IDs. [#129216][#129216]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Adding too large ranges to the problematic ranges page in DB Console. If a range is larger than twice the max range size, it will show up in the problematic ranges page. [#129001][#129001]
- Some metric charts on the overview and replication pages have more terse legends to facilitate easier browsing. [#129149][#129149]
- Users with VIEWACTIVITY can download stmt bundles from DB console. [#128938][#128938]
- DB Console will show a notification alerting customers without an Enterprise license, to upcoming license changes with a link to more information. [#129420][#129420]
- Changes notification alert icon [#130333][#130333]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate `IS NOT NULL` filter if it was applied to non-NULL tuples that had NULL elements (like `(1, NULL)` or `(NULL, NULL)`). The bug is present since 20.2 version and is now fixed. [#126901][#126901]
- Fixed a bug related to displaying the names of composite types in the SHOW CREATE TABLES command. The names are now shown as two-part names, which disambiguates the output and makes it more portable to other databases. [#127158][#127158]
- CONCAT() now accepts arguments of any data type. [#127098][#127098]
- Fixed a bug that prevented merged stats from being created after injecting stats or recreating statement bundles. This would occur when the injected stats/statement bundle contained related full and partial statistics. [#127252][#127252]
- CockroachDB previously could encounter spurious `(error encountered after some results were delivered)` `ERROR: context canceled` errors when evaluating some queries in rare cases. Most likely conditions are: - the query has to be executed locally - have a LIMIT - have at least two UNION clauses - have some lookup / index joins in the UNION branches.  The bug is present since 22.2 and is now fixed. [#127076][#127076]
- Updated restore job description from `RESTORE ... FROM` to `RESTORE FROM {backup} IN {collectionURI}` to reflect the new restore syntax. [#127970][#127970]
- Fix a bug in which SELECT FOR UPDATE or SELECT FOR SHARE queries using SKIP LOCKED and a LIMIT and/or an OFFSET could return incorrect results under Read Committed isolation. This bug was present when support for SKIP LOCKED under Read Committed isolation was introduced in v24.1.0. [#127718][#127718]
- Fix a bug in which some SELECT FOR UPDATE or SELECT FOR SHARE queries using SKIP LOCKED could still block on locked rows when using optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable under Serializable isolation. This bug was present when optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable was introduced in v23.2.0. [#127718][#127718]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a CASE statement with multiple subqueries to produces the side effects of one of the subqueries even if it shouldn't have been evaluated. [#120327][#120327]
- Changed the schema changer’s merge process so that it can detect contention errors and automatically retry with a smaller batch size. This makes the merge process more likely to succeed without needing any manual tuning of settings. [#128201][#128201]
- Fix a bug in which SHOW CLUSTER SETTING FOR VIRTUAL CLUSTER would erroneously return NULL for some settings. [#128675][#128675]
- SHOW CREATE ALL TYPES now shows corresponding type comments in it's output. [#128084][#128084]
- Enforce statement_timeout when waiting for jobs after a schema change in an implict txn. [#128474][#128474]
- Fixes bug in safari where certain dropdowns in db-console appeared to be empty with no options to select from [#128996][#128996]
- Fixed a bug where NaN or Inf could not be used as the default value for a parameter in CREATE FUNCTION statements. [#129019][#129019]
- Fix a bug that would cause `hlc_to_timestamp` to return an incorrect timestamp for some input decimals. [#129153][#129153]
- Fixes a memory leak where statement insight objects may leak if the session is closed without the transaction finishing. [#128400][#128400]
- Starting up nodes could fail with: "could not insert session ...: unexpected value", if an ambigous result error was hit inserting into the sqlliveness table. [#128902][#128902]
- Function input parameters can no longer be of the VOID type. [#129179][#129179]
- Fix bug in the public preview WAL failover feature that could prevent a node from starting if it crashed during a failover. Epic: none. [#129331][#129331]
- Users with VIEWACTIVITY sql priv can now request, view and cancel stmt bundles in DB console. [#128856][#128856]
- Internally issued queries that are not initiated within a SQL session no longer respect a statement timeout. This includes: background jobs, queries issued by the db console that perform introspection, and the cloud sql shell. [#129489][#129489]
- Fixed a bug where 'infinity'::timestamp returned a different result than Postgres. [#127141][#127141]
- Fixed a rare bug in SHOW CLUSTER SETTING that could cause it to fail with an error like `timed out: value differs between local setting and KV`. [#129520][#129520]
- Fixed a bug where the schema_locked table parameter did not prevent a table from being referenced by a foreign key. [#129746][#129746]
- Fix a bug that could cause RESTORE to hang after encountering transient errors from the storage layer.  Epic: none. [#129750][#129750]
- Fixed a bug where the require_explicit_primary_keys session variable would overly aggressively prevent all CREATE TABLE statements from working. [#129881][#129881]
- A spurious error log from queue.go involving " needs lease, not adding" no longer occurs. [#129351][#129351]
- Using more than one DECLARE statment in the definition of a user defined function now correctly declares additional variables. [#129951][#129951]
- Fixed a slow-building memory leak when using kerberos authentication. [#130273][#130273]
- Fix a bug in which some SELECT FOR UPDATE or SELECT FOR SHARE queries using NOWAIT could still block on locked rows when using `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` under Serializable isolation. This bug was present when `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` was introduced in v23.2.0. [#130103][#130103]
- Addressed a bug in the upgrade pre-condition for repairing descriptor corruption, which could lead to finalization being stuck [#130064][#130064]
- A bug has been fixed that the optimizer to plan unnecessary post-query uniqueness checks during `INSERT`, `UPSERT`, and `UPDATE` statements on tables with partial, unique, hash-sharded indexes. These unnecessary checks added overhead to execution of these statements, and caused the statements to error when executed under read-committed isolation. [#130366][#130366]
- Fixes a potential memory leak in changefeeds using a cloud storage sink. The memory leak could occur if both changefeed.fast_gzip.enabled and changefeed.cloudstorage.async_flush.enabled are true and the changefeed received an error while attempting to write to the cloud storage sink. [#130204][#130204]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect evaluation of `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `IF` expressions with branches producing fixed-width string-like types, such as `CHAR`. In addition, the `BPCHAR` type has been fixed so that it no longer incorrectly imposes a length limit of 1. [#129007][#129007]
- Fixed a bug where zone configuration changes issued by the declarative schema changer were not blocked if a table had `schema_locked` set. For more information about the declarative schema changer, see: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/online-schema-changes#declarative-schema-changer/. [#130670][#130670]
- Fix bug that could prevent a CHANGEFEED from being able to resume after being paused for prolonged period of time. [#130622][#130622]
- If a connection was attempting a schema change while the same schema objects were being dropped, it was possible for the connection to be incorrectly dropped. [#130928][#130928]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that can cause incorrect results when: 1. The query contains a correlated subquery. 2. The correlated subquery has a GroupBy or DistinctOn operator with an    outer-column reference in its input. 3. The correlated subquery is in the input of a Select or Join operator 4. The Select or Join has a filter that sets the outer-column reference from    (2) equal to a non-outer column in the input of the grouping operator. 5. The grouping column set does not include the replacement column, and    functionally determines the replacement column. [#130925][#130925]
- A bug has been fixed which could cause errors with the message "internal error: Non-nullable column ..." when executing statements under read-committed isolation that involve tables with `NOT NULL` virtual columns. [#130725][#130725]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause a very rare internal error "lists in SetPrivate are not all the same length" when executing queries. [#130981][#130981]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause incorrect evaluation of scalar expressions involving `NULL` values in rare cases. [#128123][#128123]
- SHOW CREATE ALL SCHEMAS now shows corresponding schema comments in it's output. [#130164][#130164]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2.0 where creating a new incremental schedule via `ALTER SCHEDULE` on a full backup schedule created on an older version would fail. [#131231][#131231]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-alpha-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Planning time for complex queries has been reduced. [#128049][#128049]
- Reduce the write-amplification impact of rebalances by splitting snapshot sstable files into smaller ones before ingesting them into Pebble. [#127997][#127997]
- Further improves the performance of job-system related queries. [#123848][#123848]
- The query optimizer now plans limited, partial index scans in more cases. [#129901][#129901]
- The initialization of the execution engine for a query is now more efficient when the query plan contains aggregate functions. [#130834][#130834]
