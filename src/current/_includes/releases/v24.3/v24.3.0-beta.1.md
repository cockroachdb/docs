Release Date: October 24, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The cluster setting [`diagnostics.reporting.enabled`]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-diagnostics-reporting-enabled) is now ignored if the cluster has a [{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} Trial or {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} Free license]({% link v24.3/licensing-faqs.md %}#types-of-licenses), or if the reporting job is unable to load any license at all. [#132257][#132257]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- This change ensures authorization with LDAP only works when the `ldapgrouplistfilter` option is present in the [HBA configuration]({% link v24.3/security-reference/authentication.md %}#hba-configuration-syntax), otherwise authentication will proceed with the provided LDAP auth method options in the HBA configuration. This change is to ensure external authorization with LDAP is opt-in rather than enabled by default. [#132235][#132235]
- Added a [changefeed sink]({% link v24.3/changefeed-sinks.md %}) error metric `changefeed.sink_errors`, and expanded reporting of the internal retries metric `changefeed.internal_retry_message_count` to all sinks that perform internal retries. [#132092][#132092]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Implemented `DROP TRIGGER` statements. The `CASCADE` option for dropping a [trigger]({% link v24.3/sql-feature-support.md %}) is not supported. [#128540][#128540]
- Added support for `CREATE TRIGGER`. The `OR REPLACE` syntax is not supported. Also, [triggers]({% link v24.3/sql-feature-support.md %}) cannot be executed, so creation is a no-op. [#128540][#128540]
- [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link v24.3/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) and [`PARTITION ALL BY`]({% link v24.3/partitioning.md %}) tables can now be inserted into under [non-`SERIALIZABLE` isolation levels]({% link v24.3/read-committed.md %}) as long as there is no `ON CONFLICT` clause in the statement. Also, [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link v24.3/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) and [`PARTITION ALL BY`]({% link v24.3/partitioning.md %}) tables can now be updated under non-`SERIALIZABLE` isolation levels. [#129837][#129837]
- Attempting to add [foreign keys]({% link v24.3/foreign-key.md %}) referencing a table with [row-level TTL]({% link v24.3/row-level-ttl.md %}) enabled will generate a notice informing the user about potential impact on the row-level TTL deletion job. Similarly, a notice is generated while attempting to enable row-level TTL on a table that has inbound foreign key references. [#127935][#127935]
- It is now possible to assign to an element of a composite typed variable in [PL/pgSQL]({% link v24.3/plpgsql.md %}). For example, given a variable `foo` with two integer elements `x` and `y`, the following assignment statement is allowed: `foo.x := 100;`. [#132628][#132628]
- [Backup]({% link v24.3/backup.md %}) and [restore]({% link v24.3/restore.md %}) now work for tables with triggers. When the [`skip_missing_udfs` option]({% link v24.3/restore.md %}#skip-missing-udfs) is applied, triggers with missing trigger functions are removed from the table. [#128555][#128555]
- `UPSERT and INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` statements are now supported on [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link v24.3/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) tables under [`READ COMMITTED` isolation]({% link v24.3/read-committed.md %}). [#132768][#132768]
- Added support for row-level `BEFORE` triggers. A row-level trigger executes the trigger function for each row that is being mutated. `BEFORE` triggers fire before the mutation operation. [#132511][#132511]
- Added support for [PL/pgSQL]({% link v24.3/plpgsql.md %}) integer `FOR` loops, which iterate over a range of integer values. [#130211][#130211]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- [Admission Control]({% link v24.3/admission-control.md %}) now has an integration for pacing snapshot ingest traffic based on disk bandwidth. `kvadmission.store.snapshot_ingest_bandwidth_control.enabled` is used to turn on this integration. It requires provisioned bandwidth to be set for the store (or cluster through the [cluster setting]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %})) for it to take effect. [#131243][#131243]
- Added validation to check whether [audit logging]({% link v24.3/configure-logs.md %}) and [buffering configurations]({% link v24.3/configure-logs.md %}#log-buffering-for-network-sinks) are both present in the [file log sink]({% link v24.3/configure-logs.md %}#configure-log-sinks). Audit logging and buffering configuration should not both exist in the file log sink. [#132742][#132742]
- Updated the [file log sink]({% link v24.3/configure-logs.md %}#configure-log-sinks) validation message. This would give clear indication to the user about the expected valid configuration. [#132899][#132899]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The value of the automatic [statistics]({% link v24.3/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#table-statistics) collection cluster setting [`sql.stats.automatic_collection.enabled`]({% link v24.3/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-stats-automatic-collection-enabled) is now in the top right corner of the [**Databases**]({% link v24.3/ui-databases-page.md %}) overview page. [#132269][#132269]
- In the new [**Databases**]({% link v24.3/ui-databases-page.md %}) and [**Tables**]({% link v24.3/ui-databases-page.md %}#tables-view) pages, when cached data is being refreshed, the refresh button will be disabled and its tooltip text will display, `Data is currently refreshing`. [#132462][#132462]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Addressed a rare bug that could prevent [backups]({% link v24.3/backup.md %}) taken during a [`DROP COLUMN`]({% link v24.3/alter-table.md %}#drop-column) operation with a [sequence]({% link v24.3/create-sequence.md %}) owner from [restoring]({% link v24.3/restore.md %}) with the error: `rewriting descriptor ids: missing rewrite for <id> in SequenceOwner...`. [#132202][#132202]
- Fixed a bug existing since before v23.1 that could lead to incorrect results in rare cases. The bug requires a [join]({% link v24.3/joins.md %}) between two tables with an equality between columns with equivalent, but not identical [types]({% link v24.3/data-types.md %}) (e.g., `OID` and `REGCLASS`). In addition, the join must lookup into an [index]({% link v24.3/indexes.md %}) that includes a [computed column]({% link v24.3/computed-columns.md %}) that references one of the equivalent columns. [#126345][#126345]
- Fixed a bug existing since before v23.1 that could lead to incorrect results in rare cases. The bug requires a lookup [join]({% link v24.3/joins.md %}) into a table with a computed [index]({% link v24.3/indexes.md %}) column, where the [computed column]({% link v24.3/computed-columns.md %}) expression is composite sensitive. A composite sensitive expression can compare differently if supplied non-identical but equivalent input values (e.g., `2.0::DECIMAL` versus `2.00::DECIMAL`). [#126345][#126345]
- Fixed a bug that caused quotes around the name of a routine to be dropped when it was called within another [routine]({% link v24.3/user-defined-functions.md %}). This could prevent the correct routine from being resolved if the nested routine name was case-sensitive. The bug has existed since v24.1 when nested routines were introduced. [#131643][#131643]
- Fixed a bug where the [SQL shell]({% link v24.3/cockroach-sql.md %}) would print out the previous error message when executing the `quit` command. [#130736][#130736]
- Fixed a bug where a [span statistics]({% link v24.3/show-ranges.md %}#span-statistics) request on a mixed-version cluster resulted in a null pointer exception. [#132349][#132349]
- Fixed an issue where [changefeeds]({% link v24.3/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) would fail to update [protected timestamp records]({% link v24.3/protect-changefeed-data.md %}) in the face of [retryable errors]({% link v24.3/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md %}#changefeed-retry-errors). [#132712][#132712]
- The [`franz-go`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) library has been updated to fix a potential deadlock on [changefeed]({% link v24.3/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) restarts. [#132761][#132761]
- Fixed a bug that in rare cases could cause incorrect evaluation of [scalar expressions]({% link v24.3/scalar-expressions.md %}) involving `NULL` values. [#132261][#132261]
- Fixed a bug in the query [optimizer]({% link v24.3/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) that in rare cases could cause CockroachDB nodes to crash. The bug could occur when a query contains a filter in the form `col IN (elem0, elem1, ..., elemN)` only when `N` is very large, (e.g., 1.6+ million), and when `col` exists in a [hash-sharded index]({% link v24.3/hash-sharded-indexes.md %}), or exists a table with an indexed, [computed column]({% link v24.3/computed-columns.md %}) dependent on `col`. [#132701][#132701]
- The `proretset` column of the [`pg_catalog.pg_proc`]({% link v24.3/pg-catalog.md %}) table is now properly set to `true` for set-returning built-in functions. [#132853][#132853]
- Fixed an error that could be caused by using an [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`]({% link v24.3/as-of-system-time.md %}) expression that references a user-defined (or unknown) type name. These kinds of expressions are invalid, but previously the error was not handled properly. Now, a correct error message is returned. [#132348][#132348]
