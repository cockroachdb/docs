<h3 id="v24-3-15-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the metrics `sql.txn.auto_retry.count` and `sql.statements.auto_retry.count`, which count the number of automatic retries of SQL transactions and statements, respectively, within the database. These metrics differ from the related `txn.restarts.*` metrics, which count retryable errors emitted by the KV layer that must be retried. The new `sql.txn.auto_retry.count` and `sql.statements.auto_retry.count` metrics count auto-retry actions taken by the SQL layer in response to some of those retryable errors.
 [#148229][#148229]
- Added a session variable `initial_retry_backoff_for_read_committed` that controls the initial backoff duration when retrying an individual statement in an explicit `READ COMMITTED` transaction. A duration of `0` disables exponential backoff. If a statement in an explicit `READ COMMITTED` transaction is failing with the `40001` error `ERROR: restart transaction: read committed retry limit exceeded; set by max_retries_for_read_committed=...`, then you should set `initial_retry_backoff_for_read_committed` to a duration proportional to the typical execution time of the statement (in addition to also increasing `max_retries_for_read_committed`).

<h3 id="v24-3-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause an `AFTER` trigger to fail with `client already committed or rolled back the transaction` if the query also contained foreign-key cascades. The bug had existed since `AFTER` triggers were introduced in v24.3.
 [#146974][#146974]
- Fixed a bug that could potentially cause a changefeed to complete erroneously when one of its watched tables encounters a schema change.
 [#147031][#147031]
- Fixed a bug that caused the SQL Activity > Statement Fingerprint page to fail to load details for statements run with application names containing a `#` character.
 [#147221][#147221]
- Fixed a bug that could cause the `cockroach` process to `segfault` when collecting runtime execution traces (typically collected via the **Advanced Debug** page in the Console).
 [#147337][#147337]
- Fixed a bug that caused the optimizer to ignore index hints when optimizing some forms of prepared statements. This could result in one of two unexpected behaviors: a query errors with the message `index cannot be used for this query` when the index can actually be used; or a query uses an index that does not adhere to the hint. The hints relevant to this bug are regular index hints, e.g., `SELECT * FROM tab@index`, `FORCE_INVERTED_INDEX`, and `FORCE_ZIGZAG`.
 [#147415][#147415]
- Fixed the database filter in the DB Console's Hot Ranges page, which was broken in v24.3.3, and updated the locality filter to remove duplicate entries.
 [#147444][#147444]
- Fixed a bug that could cause stable expressions to be folded in cached query plans. The bug could cause stable expressions like `current_setting` to return the wrong result if used in a prepared statement. The bug was introduced in v23.2.22, v24.1.14, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, and the v25.2 alpha.
 [#147458][#147458]
- Fixed a bug where prepared statements on schema changes could fail with runtime errors.
 [#147669][#147669]
- Fixed a bug where `ALTER TABLE` was modifying identity attributes on columns not backed by a sequence.
 [#147768][#147768]
- Fixed an issue with logical data replication (LDR) where the presence of a unique index could have caused spurious dead-letter queue (DLQ) entries if the unique index had a smaller index ID than the primary key index. [#147354][#147354]

- TTL jobs now respond to cluster topology changes by restarting and rebalancing across available nodes.
