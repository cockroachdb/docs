<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-3-sql-changes">SQL changes</h3>

- [Physical Cluster Replication]({% link v24.3/physical-cluster-replication-overview.md %}) reader catalogs now bypass AOST timestamps using the `bypass_pcr_reader_catalog_aost` session variable, which can be used to modify cluster settings within the reader. [#133876][#133876]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a timer for inner [changefeed sink]({% link v24.3/changefeed-sinks.md %}) client flushes. [#133288][#133288]
- Rows replicated by Logical Data Replication in `immediate` mode are now considered in the decision to recompute SQL table statistics. [#133591][#133591]
- The new cluster setting `kvadmission.flow_controller.token_reset_epoch` can be used to refill replication [admission control]({% link v24.3/admission-control.md %}) v2 tokens. This is an advanced setting. Use it only after consultation with your account team. [#133294][#133294]
- The new cluster setting `goschedstats.always_use_short_sample_period.enabled`, when set to `true`, helps to prevent unnecessary queueing due to CPU [admission control]({% link v24.3/admission-control.md %}s. [#133585][#133585]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- In [Database]({% link v24.3/ui-databases-page.md %}) pages, the **Refresh** tooltip now includes details about the progress of cache updates and when the job started. [#133351][#133351]

<h3 id="v24-3-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [changefeed sink]({% link v24.3/changefeed-sinks.md %})) timers were not correctly registered with the metric system. [#133288][#133288]
- Fixed a bug that could cause new connections to fail with the following error after upgrading: `ERROR: invalid value for parameter "vectorize": "unknown(1)" SQLSTATE: 22023 HINT: Available values: off,on,experimental_always`. To encounter this bug, the cluster must have:
    1. Run on version v21.1 at some point in the past
    1. Run `SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.defaults.vectorize = 'on';` while running v21.1.
    1. **Not** set `sql.defaults.vectorize` after upgrading past v21.1 4.
    1. Subsequently upgraded to v24.2.upgraded all the way to v24.2.

    To detect this bug, run the following query:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SELECT * FROM system.settings WHERE name = 'sql.defaults.vectorize
    ~~~

    If the command returns `1` instead of `on`, run the following statement before upgrading.

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    RESET CLUSTER SETTING sql.defaults.vectorize;
    ~~~

    `1` is now allowed as a value for this setting, and is equivalent to `on`. [#133371][#133371]
- Fixed a bug in v22.2.13+, v23.1.9+, and v23.2 that could cause the internal error `interface conversion: coldata.Column is` in an edge case. [#133762][#133762]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.1.0 that could cause erroneous `NOT NULL` constraint violation errors to be logged during `UPSERT` and `INSERT` statements with the `ON CONFLICT ...DO UPDATE` clause that update an existing row and a subset of columns that did not include a `NOT NULL` column of the table. [#133820][#133820]
- Fixed a that could cache and reuse a non-reusable query plan, such as a plan for a DDL or `SHOW` statement, when `plan_cache_mode` was set to `auto` or `force_generic_plan`, which are not the default options. [#133073][#133073]
- Fixed an unhandled error that could occur while running the command `REVOKE ... ON SEQUENCE FROM ... {user}` on an object that is not a sequence. [#133710][#133710]
- Fixed a panic that could occur while running a `CREATE TABLE AS` statement that included a [sequence]({% link v24.3/create-sequence.md %}) with an invalid function overload. [#133870][#133870]
