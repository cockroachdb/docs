As of 2024, CockroachDB uses a staged release process. New versions roll out to select CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organizations first. CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} binaries are published later, with timing based on release type:

- Major releases (x.y.0 GA): Approximately 2 weeks after Cloud GA.
- Patch releases (x.y.1+): Approximately 1 week after Cloud availability.

Exact timing may vary based on rollout safety and scheduling.
