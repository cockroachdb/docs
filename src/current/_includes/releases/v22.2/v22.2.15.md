## v22.2.15

Release Date: October 23, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-15-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The maximum permitted value of the `COCKROACH_RPC_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` environment variable has been increased to `64MB`. By increasing this environment variable, in conjunction with tuning OS-level maximum TCP window size, you can increase the throughput that [Raft replication](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/architecture/replication-layer#raft) can sustain over high latency network links. [#111288][#111288]

<h3 id="v22-2-15-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new [metric](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/metrics) `changefeed.lagging_ranges` that shows the number of [ranges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/overview#architecture-range) which are behind in changefeeds. This metric can be used with the [`metrics_label` changefeed option](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-changefeed#options). The calculation of this metric is controlled by two new [cluster settings](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings): (1) `lagging_ranges_threshold`, with a default of 3 minutes, is the amount of time a range needs to be behind to be considered lagging, and (2) `lagging_ranges_polling_interval`, with a default of 1 minute, controls how often the lagging ranges calculation is done. Note that polling adds latency to the metric being updated. For example, if a range falls behind by 3 minutes, the metric may not update until an additional minute afterwards. Also note that ranges undergoing an initial scan for longer than the threshold are considered to be lagging. Starting a changefeed with an initial scan on a large table will likely increment the metric for each range in the table. However, as ranges complete the initial scan, the number of lagging ranges will decrease. [#110970][#110970]
- Added a new [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) `server.http.base_path` that controls the redirection of the browser after successful [login with OIDC SSO](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/sso-db-console). It is expected that most users should *not* have to adjust this setting. Adjust this setting in the case where the `cockroach` process is running behind a load-balancer or proxy that serves `cockroach` under a subpath such as `https://<hostname>/crdb/`. In which case, it is necessary for the browser to redirect to `/crdb` after login instead of `/` which previously was the hardcoded default. [#111463][#111463]

<h3 id="v22-2-15-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach debug zip`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroach-debug-zip) command now has an `--include-goroutine-stacks` flag which  controls whether to fetch stack traces for all goroutines running on each targeted node in `nodes/*/stacks.txt` and `nodes/*/stacks_with_labels.txt` files. Fetching stack traces for all goroutines is a "stop-the-world" operation, which can momentarily have negative impacts on [SQL service latency](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-overview-dashboard#service-latency-sql-99th-percentile). Set `--include-goroutine-stacks` to `false` to not fetch stack traces in order to avoid negative impacts to SQL service latency. Note that any periodic goroutine dumps previously taken on the node will still be included in `nodes/*/goroutines/*.txt.gz`, as these would have already been generated and do not require any "stop-the-world" operations. [#110258][#110258]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroach-debug-zip) archive now includes one file per node with information about the [KV ranges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/reads-and-writes-overview#cockroachdb-architecture-terms) stored on that node, in `nodes/{node ID}/ranges.json`. Previously, there was one file per range per node, in `nodes/{node ID}/ranges/{range ID}.json`. [#110050][#110050]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroach-debug-zip) command now accepts an `--include-range-info` flag, which determines whether [range](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/overview#architecture-range) information is retrieved in `nodes/{node ID}/ranges.json` files. This flag defaults to true. [#110050][#110050]

<h3 id="v22-2-15-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-overview) now constructs client-side requests using relative URLs instead of absolute ones. This enables proxying of the DB Console at arbitrary subpaths. [#110444][#110444]
- The [**SQL Connection Rate**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-sql-dashboard#sql-connection-rate) metric on the SQL Dashboard is downsampled using the MAX function instead of SUM. This improves situations where zooming out the time range would cause the connection rate to increase for downsampled data. [#110496][#110496]

<h3 id="v22-2-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, when memory was exceeded while executing the [`EXPORT INTO PARQUET`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/export#export-a-table-into-parquet) statement, this resulted in [out-of-memory crashes (OOMs)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#out-of-memory-oom-crash). Now, if memory is exceeded, the `EXPORT INTO PARQUET` statement will return an error. If you see an error related to memory, retry the `EXPORT INTO PARQUET` statement using a smaller value for the [`chunk_rows` option](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/export#export-options). Cockroach Labs [recommends using changefeeds to export data](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/export-data-with-changefeeds) because they provide better performance for growing workloads. Additionally, changefeeds [operate as jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/show-jobs), which offer [observability](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds) and [job management](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds). [#110718][#110718]
- Fixed a bug that prevented table statistics from loading on the [Databases page Tables view](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-databases-page#tables-view). [#109921][#109921]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a [transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/transactions) performing multiple parallel [foreign key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/foreign-key) checks to return a `concurrent txn use detected` error. [#109850][#109850]
- Fixed a bug where dependencies on [sequences](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-sequence) from tables would be reported with the wrong value for the `classid` column in the `pg_catalog.pg_depend` table. [#110211][#110211]
- Fixed edge cases in [decimal](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/decimal) and [float](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/float) evaluation for division operators. `'NaN'::DECIMAL / 0` will now return `NaN` instead of a division-by-zero error, and `0 / 'inf'::DECIMAL` will return `0` instead of `0E-2019`. [#110298][#110298]
- The `cockroach debug pebble` command now works correctly with [encrypted stores](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/security-reference/encryption#cockroachdb-self-hosted-clusters) which do not use the default `cockroach-data` path without having to also pass `--store`. [#110509][#110509]
- When upgrading from previous releases, it was possible that ambiguous references to [sequences](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-sequence) would fail to be resolved by ID if they were in the same schema. Additionally, the logging is improved for ambiguous cases where the reference cannot be resolved. [#110721][#110721]
- Fixed a bug where [`RESET `](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/row-level-ttl#reset-a-storage-parameter-to-its-default-value)[(`ttl_expire_after`)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/row-level-ttl#using-ttl_expire_after) could incorrectly remove [`ttl_expiration_expression`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/row-level-ttl#using-ttl_expiration_expression). [#110750][#110750]
- Fixed a bug where [`format_type`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#compatibility-functions) builtin did not honor `typemod` information for [array](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/array) types, leading to incorrect output. [#110939][#110939]
- Fixed a bug where `indoption` inside [`pg_index`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/pg-catalog#data-exposed-by-pg_catalog) was not properly encoded, causing it to be unable to be decoded as `int2vector`. [#111956][#111956]
- Fixed a bug where the [optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cost-based-optimizer) failed to honor the `statement_timeout` session setting when generating constrained index scans for queries with large `IN` lists or `= ANY` predicates on multiple index key columns, which may lead to an [out-of-memory crash (OOM)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#out-of-memory-oom-crash) on the node. [#112075][#112075]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors during query [optimization](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cost-based-optimizer) in rare cases. The bug has been present since version 2.1.11, but it is more likely to occur in version 21.2.0 and later, though it is still rare. The bug only presents when a query contains `min` and `max` [aggregate functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#aggregate-functions). [#112299][#112299]
