<h3 id="v22-2-19-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, querying the [`crdb_internal.leases` table](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/crdb-internal) could cause a [node](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-cluster-overview-page#node-status) to become unavailable due to a deadlock in the leasing subsystem. This is now fixed. [#119463][#119463]
- Fixed a bug where [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds#enable-rangefeeds) resolved timestamps could get stuck, continually emitting the log message `pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split`, typically following a [range merge](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/distribution-layer.html#range-merges). This bug was introduced in v22.2.18. [#119560][#119560]
