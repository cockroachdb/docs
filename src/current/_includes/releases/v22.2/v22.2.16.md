Release Date: November 6, 2023

<h3 id="v22-2-16-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare internal error in the optimizer that has existed since before version 22.1, which could occur while enforcing orderings between SQL operators. [#113640][#113640]
- CockroachDB previously could incorrectly evaluate lookup and index joins into tables with at least 3 column families in some cases (either "non-nullable column with no value" internal error would occur or the query would return incorrect results), and this is now fixed. The bug was introduced in 22.2. [#113694][#113694]
