<h3 id="v22-2-16-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare internal error in the [optimizer](../v22.1/cost-based-optimizer.html), which could occur while enforcing orderings between SQL operators. This error has existed since before v22.1. [#113640][#113640]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate [lookup](../v23.2/joins.html#lookup-joins) and index [joins](../v23.2/joins.html) into tables with at least three [column families](../v23.2/column-families.html). This would result in either the `non-nullable column with no value` internal error, or the query would return incorrect results. This bug was introduced in v22.2. [#113694][#113694]
