<h3 id="v22-2-17-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could prevent [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/restore.html) from working if it was performed during a cluster upgrade. [#112757][#112757]
- Queries with the `st_union` [aggregate function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) could produce incorrect results in some cases due to the [query optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cost-based-optimizer) performing invalid optimizations. This bug has been present since the `st_union` function was introduced in v20.2.0. [#112796][#112796]
- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate lookup and index [joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/joins.html) into tables with at least 3 [column families](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/column-families.html) in some cases (either a `non-nullable column with no value` internal error would occur, or the query would return incorrect results). This is now fixed. The bug was introduced in v22.2. [#113109][#113109]
- Fixed a rare internal error in the [optimizer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) that could occur while enforcing orderings between SQL operators. This bug had existed since before v22.1. [#113175][#113175]
- Previously, a warning that points to [technical advisory #99561](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/advisories/a99561.html) could incorrectly surface when dropping [secondary indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/indexes.html) that store [primary key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/primary-key.html) columns. This is now fixed. [#113004][#113004]
- Fixed a bug that could cause internal errors or panics while attempting to forecast [statistics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) on a numeric column. [cockroachdb/cockroach#113800][#113800]
- Previously, when executing queries with index / lookup [joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/joins.html) when the ordering needs to be maintained, CockroachDB in some cases could get into a pathological behavior which would lead to increased query latency, possibly by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. This bug was introduced in v22.2 and is now fixed. [#114368][#114368]
