## v22.2.14

Release Date: September 14, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-14-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a new syntax to [`SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](../v22.2/show-default-privileges.html). Executing `SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR GRANTEE <grantee>` shows the default privileges that a grantee received. [#108283][#108283]

<h3 id="v22-2-14-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- CockroachDB binaries and Docker images for Linux on the ARM architecture are [generally available](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroachdb-feature-availability#feature-availability-phases).

<h3 id="v22-2-14-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Nodes are now considered suspect when rejoining a cluster and cannot accept lease transfers for one `server.time_after_store_suspect` window, which defaults to 30 seconds. [#107670][#107670]
- Added two new [changefeed metrics](../v22.2/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#recommended-changefeed-metrics-to-track): `changefeed.checkpoint_progress`  is similar to `changefeed.max_behind_nanos` but supports [metrics labels](../v22.2/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#using-changefeed-metrics-labels); `changefeed.aggregator_progress` tracks the progress of individual aggregators (the lowest timestamp for which all aggregators with the label have emitted all values they're responsible for). [#109745][#109745]

<h3 id="v22-2-14-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a potential deadlock when running [changefeeds](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html) with `end_time` option set. [#108076][#108076]
- Added cancel checking to [index](../v22.2/indexes.html) constraint initialization code to allow queries to timeout during [query optimization](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) if analyzing predicates to constrain an index starts using too many resources. Example of setting a timeout using the [`statement_timeout` session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html#statement-timeout): `SET statement_timeout='5.0s';`.  [#106950][#106950]
- Fixed the [schema changer](../v22.2/online-schema-changes.html) [job](../v22.2/show-jobs.html) when [`CREATE AS`](../v22.2/create-table-as.html) sources from [`SHOW CREATE FUNCTION`](../v22.2/show-create.html#show-the-create-function-statement-for-a-function), for example: `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW CREATE FUNCTION f];`.  [#108167][#108167]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an internal error `unexpected non-zero bytes limit for txnKVStreamer` when evaluating [locality-optimized](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters) lookup [joins](../v22.2/joins.html) in case it had to perform the remote regions' lookup. The bug was introduced in [v22.2](../releases/v22.2.html) and is now fixed. A temporary workaround can be accomplished without upgrading by setting the `streamer_enabled` [session variable](../v22.2/set-vars.html): `SET streamer_enabled = false;`. [#108252][#108252]
- Fixed a spurious error `no data source matches prefix` that could occur during [planning for a query](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) with `DISTINCT ON` and [`ORDER BY ASC NULLS LAST`](../v22.2/order-by.html) or `ORDER BY DESC NULLS FIRST`. [#108302][#108302]
- Fixed a bug where using [`IMPORT INTO`](../v22.2/import-into.html) for `DELIMITED DATA` or MySQL imports would error with `column ... does not exist` if it was importing into a [collated string](../v22.2/collate.html) column. [#108287][#108287]
- Fixed a bug in the index recommendations provided in the [`EXPLAIN`](../v22.2/explain.html) output where [`ALTER INDEX ... VISIBLE`](../v22.2/alter-index.html#not-visible) index recommendations may suggest making the wrong index visible when there are multiple invisible indexes in a table. [#108647][#108647]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a query with [`LIMIT`](../v22.2/limit-offset.html#limit) and [`ORDER BY`](../v22.2/order-by.html) to return results in the wrong order. This bug could also cause incorrect results if the `LIMIT` was nested within an outer query, for example, under another `LIMIT`. [#107379][#107379]
- Fixed a bug introduced in [v22.1](../releases/v22.1.html) that could cause a [join](../v22.2/joins.html) to infinite-loop in rare cases when the join filter is not an equality and no columns from the left input are returned. [#106874][#106874]
- Fixed a bug that caused nodes to crash when attempting to [`EXECUTE`](../v22.2/sql-grammar.html#execute_stmt) a prepared statement with an argument that referenced a [user-defined function (UDF)](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html). This bug was present since user-defined functions were introduced in [v22.2.0]({% link releases/v22.2.md %}#v22-2-0). [#108473][#108473]
- Fixed an issue with the full scan filter on the [**Statements** page](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html) where the filter was always evaluating to false, even if a full scan had occurred. [#109284][#109284]
- Fixed a bug that could cause some rows to be silently skipped during [`IMPORT`](../v22.2/import.html) when a node's import worker failed. [#109662][#109662]
- Fixed a bug where calls to [user-defined functions (UDFs)](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) with NULL arguments returned ambiguous results. [#109193][#109193]
- Fixed a very rare condition where the [storage engine](../v22.2/architecture/storage-layer.html) stops making progress, reporting `background error: pebble: flush next log number is unset` in the [`cockroach-pebble.log`](../v22.2/logging-overview.html#logging-destinations). [#109862][#109862]
- Fixed a nil pointer dereference panic during [node startup](../v22.2/cockroach-start.html) caused by an incorrect initialization order. [#109685][#109685]
- Fixed an issue where a [split](../v22.2/architecture/distribution-layer.html#range-splits) can be called on an invalid key that's in the form of `someValidKey.Next()` during [restore](../v22.2/restore.html) with the [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) `bulkio.restore.use_simple_import_spans=true`. This split key can land in the middle of a row with [column families](../v22.2/column-families.html), and thus result in failing SQL queries when querying the restored table. [#109941][#109941]
