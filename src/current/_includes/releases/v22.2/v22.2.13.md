## v22.2.13

Release Date: August 8, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-13-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The full set of TLS ciphers that was present in v22.1 have been included in the existing cipher suites list, which can be enabled with the `COCKROACH_TLS_ENABLE_OLD_CIPHER_SUITES` environment variable. [#105355][#105355]

<h3 id="v22-2-13-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Inbound foreign keys are now allowed on TTL tables. If the inbound foreign key has the [`ON DELETE CASCADE` option](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/foreign-key#foreign-key-actions), the [TTL job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/row-level-ttl#view-running-ttl-jobs) will work as usual. If the inbound foreign key has the `ON DELETE RESTRICT` option, the TTL job will fail if a row references the TTL table. [#105342][#105342]
- The [`crdb_internal.cluster_queries`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/crdb-internal) and `crdb_internal.node_queries` tables will redact SQL queries if the user has the `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` [system privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/security-reference/authorization#supported-privileges). If the user has the `VIEWACTIVITY` system privilege, these tables will not redact SQL queries. Users can now only view the `crdb_internal.cluster_queries` and `crdb_internal.node_queries` tables if they have any of the following privileges: `admin`, `VIEWACTIVITY`, or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED`. [#105551][#105551]
- The [`kv.allocator.lease_rebalance_threshold`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) cluster setting can now be used to control the minimum fraction away from the mean a store's lease count is before it is considered for lease transfers. The default setting is `0.05`. [#106186][#106186]

<h3 id="v22-2-13-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- ARM binaries for Linux and Docker images are now in Limited Access, but are not yet qualified for production use and not eligible for support or uptime SLA commitments.

<h3 id="v22-2-13-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Improved the troubleshooting experience in the [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-overview) so that generic error messages now include details about the actual error and other contextual detail. This will make it easier to find the root cause of an error. [#106410][#106410]
- Previously, there was a delay when the **Now** button was enabled in the time picker. This is fixed so that the **Now** button on the time picker is always enabled. [#107836][#107836]
- Updated the histogram window merge calculation to more accurately interpolate quantile values. This change will result in smoother, more accurate Metrics charts in the DB Console. [#104905][#104905]
- The **Database** pages will no longer display `undefined` regions and outdated node information. [#106777][#106777]

<h3 id="v22-2-13-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a crash when using `DurationToNumber` with an empty duration object on SQL Activity tables. [#105151][#105151]
- [`GRANT SYSTEM ALL ...`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/grant) no longer causes the grantee to be unable to log in. This was due to a bug where `ALL` would include the `NOSQLLOGIN` [system privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/security-reference/authorization#supported-privileges). Since `NOSQLLOGIN` is the only "negative" privilege, it is now excluded from the `ALL` shorthand, and must be granted explicitly in order to restrict logins. [#105081][#105081]
- Fixed a source of mutex contention within the storage engine that could increase tail latencies on high-CPU, high-throughput deployments. [#105375][#105375]
- Fixed a bug where the [**Job Details** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-jobs-page#job-details) would flicker between the job details and a loading animation while a job is still executing. [#106156][#106156]
- Fixed a bug where the **Sort** dropdown on the [**Network Latency** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/ui-network-latency-page) would not persist the selected value because a page reload was triggered. [#107295][#107295]
- Previously, CockroachDB would crash when evaluating [`CREATE TABLE..AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-table-as) or [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW..AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-view) statements when the `AS` clause selected data from [`crdb_internal.cluster_statement_statistics`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/crdb-internal) or `crdb_internal.cluster_transaction_statistics` virtual tables. This bug has been present since at least v22.1 and is now fixed. [#105359][#105359]
- Fixed a bug that caused [`INSERT..ON CONFLICT..DO UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/insert#on-conflict-clause) queries to incorrectly result in an ambiguous column error. The bug only presented if the target table had a [computed column](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/computed-columns) with an expression referencing a column with a `DEFAULT` value. [#105024][#105024]
- Previously, cross-database type references were allowed through [`CREATE TABLE..AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-table-as) statements if the source table was from another database and any of its columns was of a [user-defined type](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-type). This introduced a bug where the source table could be dropped and the type could not be found for the `CREATE TABLE..AS` table. This fix disallows such `CREATE TABLE..AS` statements. [#105619][#105619]
- Fixed a bug that could cause an upgrade from v22.1 to v22.2 to take a long time, and sometimes not finish if there were a lot of tables that were being created and dropped regularly. [#99936][#99936]
- Fixed a bug in the [geospatial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/spatial-indexes#how-cockroachdbs-spatial-indexing-works) cartesian bounding box type that had incorrect behavior when comparing boxes with `NaN` values. [#105829][#105829]
- Fixed a bug that manifested itself in error messages containing `failed to drop all of the relevant elements` when executing DDL statements with the [declarative schema changer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/online-schema-changes#declarative-schema-changer). This error message actually meant that a concurrent schema change is ongoing. Instead, this now behaves as expected and waits for it to finish. [#106300][#106300]
- Fixed an issue where [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/change-data-capture-overview) emitting to a cloud storage sink with the [`compression` option](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-changefeed#compression-opt) may experience resource leakage (memory and go routines) when encountering transient errors. [#106856][#106856]
- Fixed a rare [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/change-data-capture-overview) issue that was triggered when the parent database or types were dropped. Instead of exiting with a descriptive error message, the changefeed would observe the opaque error `value type is not BYTES: UNKNOWN`. [#107937][#107937]
- Fixed a bug where the SQL activity page was not loading data during v22.1 to v22.2 ugprades. [#105664][#105664]
- Previously, flushing SQL stats in mixed version v22.1 and v22.2 clusters would fail due to an attempt to update the `index_recommendations` column, which is new in v22.2. This bug is now fixed. [#105664][#105664]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when executing `CREATE AS` statements with a [`pg_catalog.pg_prepared_statements`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/pg-catalog) or `pg_catalog.pg_cursors` source. For example: `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_prepared_statements;` or `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_prepared_statements;`. [#106288][#106288]
- Fixed a bug where some [secondary indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/schema-design-indexes) would incorrectly be treated internally as primary indexes, which could cause some schema change operations to fail. The bug could occur if [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/alter-table#alter-primary-key) was used on v21.1 or earlier, and the cluster was upgraded. [#106428][#106428]
- CockroachDB will now return an error during [user-defined function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/user-defined-functions) creation if an input argument has type `RECORD`. [#105734][#105734]
- [`SHOW SCHEMAS FROM db_name`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/show-schemas) will no longer incorrectly show schemas from the current database when the current database has a schema named `db_name`. It will now look up the database name instead of using the schema look up logic. [#106198][#106198]
- The statement tag for [`SHOW SEQUENCES`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/show-sequences) has now been corrected to `SHOW SEQUENCES` instead of `SHOW SCHEMAS`. [#106796][#106796]
- Fixed a rare bug in which some [userfile](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/use-userfile-storage) uploads would silently upload incorrect data. [#106839][#106839]
- Under prolonged unavailability, such as loss of quorum, affected ranges would exhibit [raft log](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/replication-layer#raft-logs) growth that was quadratic as a function of the duration of the outage. Now this growth is approximately linear instead. [#106055][#106055]
- This fix blocks dropping indexes that are impacted by [technical advisory 99561](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/advisories/a99561) if data loss could occur. [#106936][#106936]
- Fixed a crash that could occur if [`SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/show-grants) referenced a non-existent database name. [#107232][#107232]
- Fixed a failing schema change job when `CREATE TABLE AS` or `CREATE MATERAILIZED VIEW AS` sources from a `SHOW` command, such as:
    - `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl];`
    - `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW INDEXES FROM tbl];`
    - `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW COLUMNS FROM tbl];`
    - `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW CONSTRAINTS FROM tbl];`
    - `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW PARTITIONS FROM TABLE tbl];`
    - `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT * FROM [SHOW PARTITIONS FROM INDEX tbl@tbl_pkey];` [#107227][#107227]
- The `pg_get_serial_sequence` built-in [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators) can now handle mixed-case names correctly. [#107371][#107371]
- Fixed a bug in upstream `etcd-io/raft` which could result in pulling unlimited amount of logs into memory, and lead to out-of-memory errors. Now the log scan has a limited memory footprint. [#104483][#104483]
- Fixed a bug where, in rare circumstances, a [replication](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/replication-layer) could get stuck when proposed near lease or leadership changes, especially under overload, and the [replica circuit breakers]([../v22.2](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/architecture/replication-layer#per-replica-circuit-breakers) could trip. A previous attempt to fix this issue has been reverted in favor of this fix. [#106515][#106515]
- Fixed the SQL syntax for the [`CREATE TABLE AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-table-as) schema change job description. [#107402][#107402]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors when using [user-defined types](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-type) in views that have subqueries. This bug was present when using views since v21.2. [#106956][#106956]
- Fixed an internal error that would occur in `UPDATE`, `UPSERT`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` statements run concurrently with [`ALTER TABLE..ADD COLUMN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/alter-table#add-column) of a [virtual computed column](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/computed-columns) on the same table. [#107408][#107408]
- Previously, the [`ST_ClosestPoint`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#spatial-functions) built-in function did not preserve the correct Spatial Reference System ID (SRID) when comparing two different points. This is now resolved. [#107594][#107594]
- Fixed the SQL syntax for the [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-view) schema change job description. [#107547][#107547]
- Reduced contention on the `system.statement_statistics` table, which has caused the [SQL statistics compaction job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/show-jobs#show-automatic-jobs) to fail. [#107794][#107794]
- CockroachDB would previously crash when evaluating the [`st_asencodedpolyline`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#spatial-functions) built-in function on `GeometryCollection` geometry type. The bug was introduced before v22.1 and is now fixed. [#107902][#107902]
- CockroachDB would previously return an error when using [`SHOW RANGE..FOR ROW..`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/show-range-for-row) in [`CREATE TABLE..AS`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/create-table-as) constructs. This is now fixed. [#107602][#107602]
- Cloud storage buckets containing [backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/backup-and-restore-overview) can now be copied via [AWS DataSync](https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/) and other third-party services, which will insert an empty object with a trailing `/`. Previously, restore would fail with the following error message, `read LATEST path: path does not contain a completed latest backup: NoSuchKey`. [#106234][#106234]
- Fixed a nil pointer dereference caused by a race condition when using the [`to_char`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#date-and-time-functions) built-in function. [#108078][#108078]
- Since v22.2.0, using a PTP clock device (enabled by the [`--clock-device`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cockroach-start#general) flag) would generate timestamps in the far future. It now generates the correct time. This could cause nodes to crash due to incorrect timestamps, or in the worst case irreversibly advance the cluster's HLC clock into the far future. [#108120][#108120]
- Previously, when planning expressions containing many sub-expressions (e.g., deeply nested `AND` / `OR` structures), CockroachDB would use memory quadratical in the number of sub-expressions. In the worst cases (thousands of sub-expressions), this could lead to OOMs. This bug has been present since at least v22.1 and has now been fixed. [#107370][#107370]

<h3 id="v22-2-13-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- If the cluster setting [`sql.optimizer.uniqueness_checks_for_gen_random_uuid.enabled`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/cluster-settings) is set to `false`, the optimizer can now eliminate uniqueness checks for `STRING` and `BYTES` columns when the value is set to `gen_random_uuid()` (with an implicit or explicit cast to `STRING` or `BYTES`). If users still want the checks, they can set `sql.optimizer.uniqueness_checks_for_gen_random_uuid.enabled` to `true`. The default for this setting is `false`. [#105445][#105445]
- Performance of the [`LIKE` and `ILIKE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/functions-and-operators#operators) operators using patterns without any wildcards has been improved. [#105863][#105863]
- [Backups](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/backup-and-restore-overview) no longer perform work proportional to the number of pending intents that they encounter, so they are over 100x faster when encountering long-running, bulk-writing transactions. [#105527][#105527]
