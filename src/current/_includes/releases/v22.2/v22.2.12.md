<h3 id="v22-2-12-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Attempting to drop an index that is the only source of a column is now forbidden and results in an error. [#106936](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/106936)

<h3 id="v22-2-12-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The `debug doctor` command now allows you to verify that primary indexes store all columns. [#106936](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/106936)

<h3 id="v22-2-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in the new [declarative schema changer](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.1/online-schema-changes#declarative-schema-changer) framework that could cause the incorrect retrieval of the unique secondary index rather than the primary index. On such a cluster, an `ALTER TABLE..ADD COLUMN` statement will result in data for the new column being added to the secondary index, which could lead to query inconsistency. For details and to determine whether a cluster is impacted, refer to [Technical Advisory 99561](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/advisories/a99561).
