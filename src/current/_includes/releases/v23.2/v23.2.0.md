<h4 id="v23-2-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v23.2]({% link v23.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as [key cluster setting changes](#v23-2-0-cluster-settings), and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- The pre-v23.1 output produced by `SHOW RANGES`, `crdb_internal.ranges`, and `crdb_internal.ranges_no_leases` was deprecated in v23.1 and is now replaced by default with output that's compatible with coalesced ranges (anges that pack multiple tables/indexes/partitions into individual ranges). See the [v23.1 release notes]({% link releases/v23.1.md %}) for `SHOW RANGES` for more details. [#102961][#102961]
- When a deployment is configured to use a time zone for log file output using formats `crdb-v1` or `crdb-v2`, new output log entries cannot be processed by nodes that have not been upgraded to v23.2. [#104265][#104265]
- When customizing the [SQL shell's interactive prompt]({% link v23.2/cockroach-sql.md %}), the special sequence `%M` now expands to the full host name instead of the combination of host name and port number. To include the port number explicitly, use `%>`. The special sequence `%m` now expands to the host name up to the first period. [#105137][#105137]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}) command stores data retrieved from SQL tables in the remote cluster using the TSV format by default. [#107474][#107474]
- The [`changefeed.protect_timestamp.max_age` cluster setting]({% link v23.2/protect-changefeed-data.md %}) will only apply to newly created changefeeds in v23.2. For existing changefeeds, you can set the [`protect_data_from_gc_on_pause`]({% link v23.2/create-changefeed.md %}#protect-pause) option so that changefeeds do not experience infinite retries and accumulate protected change data. You can use the [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`]({% link v23.2/alter-changefeed.md %}) statement to add `protect_data_from_gc_on_pause` to existing changefeeds. [#103539][#103539]
- The direct export of traces to Jaeger and the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `trace.jaeger.agent` have been removed. The direct export functionality had been obsoleted since 2022; it stopped working altogether sometime in 2023 with the following error: `data does not fit within one UDP packet; size 65006, max 65000, spans NN`. Since 2022, Jaeger supports ingestion of traces using OTLP; and CockroachDB has supported emitting traces using OTLP since v22.1. Operators and developers who want to inspect traces are thus invited to use the OTLP protocol instead. The corresponding cluster setting is `trace.opentelemetry.collector`. For a successful deployment, an intermediate OTLP collector/forwarder should be configured. For an example of how to orchestrate the OpenTelemetry collector and Jaeger together using Docker Compose, or how to configure the `otel-collector`, see the more-detailed entry in [v23.2-alpha.3 backward-incompatible changes](#v23-2-0-alpha-3-backward-incompatible-changes). [#111342][#111342]

<h4 id="v23-2-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.

- The new [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `sql.txn.read_committed_syntax.enabled`, controls whether transactions run under `READ COMMITTED` or `SERIALIZABLE` isolation. It defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, the following statements will configure transactions to run under `READ COMMITTED` isolation:

  - `BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED`
  - `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED`
  - `SET default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed'`
  - `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED`

    [#110624][#110624]
- The `sql.txn.read_committed_syntax.enabled` [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) was renamed to [`sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled`](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-txn-read-committed-isolation-enabled). [#113833][#113833]
- Users who have the [`CREATEROLE` role option]({% link v23.2/grant.md %}) can now grant and revoke role membership in any non-admin role. This change also removes the [`sql.auth.createrole_allows_grant_role_membership.enabled` cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}), which was added in v23.1. In v23.2, the cluster setting is effectively always true. [#104376][#104376]
- The [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) `sql.metrics.statement_details.gateway_node.enabled` now defaults to false to reduce the number of rows generated in SQL Statistics pages. [#107788][#107788]
- The [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `kv.rangefeed.enabled` no longer controls access to `RANGEFEED SQL` commands. Instead, use `feature.changefeed.enabled`. [#110676][#110676]
- The [cluster settings]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) related to [physical cluster replication](../v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) have been renamed for consistency. For example, `bulkio.stream_ingestion.minimum_flush_interval` is now named `physical_replication.consumer.minimum_flush_interval`. [#111197][#111197]
- CockroachDB now periodically dumps the state of its internal memory accounting system into the `heap_profiler/` directory when a heap profile is taken. To disable this behavior, set the `diagnostics.memory_monitoring_dumps.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) to `false`. [#114998][#114998]
- Introduced the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `kv.gc.sticky_hint.enabled` in v23.1.13. This setting helps expedite [garbage collection](../v23.2/architecture/storage-layer.html#garbage-collection) after range deletions. For example, when a SQL table or index is dropped. `kv.gc.sticky_hint.enabled` is enabled by default and deprecated in v23.2. [#113040][#113040]
- CockroachDB now enables the pacing mechanism in rangefeed closed timestamp notifications, by setting the default `kv.rangefeed.closed_timestamp_smear_interval` cluster setting to 1ms. This makes rangefeed closed timestamp delivery more uniform and less spikey, which reduces its impact on the Go scheduler and, ultimately, foreground SQL latencies. [#103006][#103006]

<h4 id="v23-2-0-deprecations">Deprecations</h4>

- The `protect_data_from_gc_on_pause` option has been deprecated. This option is no longer needed since changefeed jobs always protect data. [#103539][#103539]
- The `cockroach connect` functionality has been deprecated. [#114241][#114241]
