<h3 id="v23-2-7-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- [Changefeeds]({% link v23.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) can use the bulk oracle for planning, which distributes work evenly across all [replicas]({% link v23.2/architecture/reads-and-writes-overview.md %}#replica) in the locality filter, including followers if enabled. Set the `changefeed.random_replica_selection.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) to `true` to enable this planning behavior. To use the previous bin-packing oracle, set the cluster setting `changefeed.random_replica_selection.enabled` to `false`. [#124925][#124925]
- [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`]({% link v23.2/alter-changefeed.md %}) no longer removes the [CDC query]({% link v23.2/cdc-queries.md %}) when modifying changefeed properties. [#125437][#125437]

<h3 id="v23-2-7-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Precision is no longer limited when encoding `geo` data types to JSON. [#124535][#124535]
- When the new `optimizer_push_offset_into_index_join` [session setting]({% link v23.2/set-vars.md %}) is enabled, the [optimizer]({% link v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) attempts to produce more efficient query plans by attempting to push offset expressions into index join expressions to produce more efficient query plans. [#124492][#124492]

<h3 id="v23-2-7-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- CockroachDB v23.2.7 and subsequent v23.2 releases are eligible for [long term support (LTS)]({% link releases/release-support-policy.md %}#support-types).

<h3 id="v23-2-7-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Improved metrics related to [disk usage]({% link v23.2/ui-storage-dashboard.md %}#capacity-metrics) reporting for volumes that dynamically change their size over time. [#125107][#125107]

<h3 id="v23-2-7-security-changes">Security changes</h3>

- Improved the automated cleanup when dropping roles inside descriptors. [#124665][#124665]

<h3 id="v23-2-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where a range with a replication factor of `1` to be scaled up to a replication factor of `2`. [#124487][#124487]
- Fixed a bug that could cause leases to thrash between nodes when perturbed with a replication factor of `1`. [#124487][#124487]
- Fixed a bug where, when the `ttl_row_stats_poll_interval` storage parameter is non-zero, the job to update row statistics for a table with [row-level TTL]({% link v23.2/row-level-ttl.md %}) enabled could be blocked from completing by the queries issued to update the row statistics. Now, if the job completes, these queries are cancelled, and the `jobs.row_level_ttl.total_rows` and `jobs.row_level_ttl.total_expired_rows` metrics will report 0 if the job finishes before the queries to update the row statistics complete. [#124626][#124626]
- Fixed a bug where the `results_buffer_size` [session setting]({% link v23.2/set-vars.md %}) could not be configured using the `options` query parameter in the connection string, but only as a top-level query parameter. This variable cannot be changed by using the `SET` command after the session begins. [#124774][#124774]
- Fixed a bug where dropping a role or user could leave references behind inside types. This in turn could prevent the [`SHOW GRANTS`]({% link v23.2/show-grants.md %}) command from working correctly. [#124644][#124644]

- Fixed a bug where the [`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER PRIMARY KEY`]({% link v23.2/alter-table.md %}#alter-primary-key) command could hang for a table if its indexes are referred to by views or functions using the `force syntax` syntax. [#124569][#124569]
- Fixed a bug where the [`SHOW TYPES`]({% link v23.2/show-types.md %}) command omitted user-defined composite types. This bug was introduced in v23.1. [#124816][#124816]
- Fixed a bug where if a column name that contains UTF-8 characters is referenced in the `STORING()` clause of the [`CREATE INDEX`]({% link v23.2/create-index.md %}) command, the [declarative schema changer]({% link v23.2/online-schema-changes.md %}#declarative-schema-changer) cannot detect whether the column is already handled by an existing index. [#125211][#125211]
- Fixed a bug where the [declarative schema changer]({% link v23.2/online-schema-changes.md %}#declarative-schema-changer) erroneously includes virtual columns that are referenced in the `STORING()` clause of the [`CREATE INDEX`]({% link v23.2/create-index.md %}) command. [#125211][#125211]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.2, where a change to a user-defined type could cause queries against tables using that type to fail with the error like `histogram.go: span must be fully contained in the bucket`. This bug could occur if the change was from an [`ALTER TABLE`]({% link v23.2/alter-table.md %}) command or from an [`ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION`]({% link v23.2/alter-database.md %}) or [`ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION`]({% link v23.2/alter-database.md %}) command, which implicitly change the non-public `crdb_internal_region` type. [#124853][#124853]
- Fixed a bug where telemetry logs could emit the same statement fingerprint ID for different SQL statements. [#125043][#125043]
- Fixed a bug where adding a column with a default value of an empty array could fail. [#125326][#125326]
- Fixed a bug where the [declarative schema changer]({% link v23.2/online-schema-changes.md %}#declarative-schema-changer) could erroneously succeed despite a violation of an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE` constraint. Now such a violation results in an error message with the error code `42601`. [#125418][#125418]
- Fixed a [changefeed]({% link v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md %}) panic in v24.1, v23.2, and v23.1 when the [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) `changefeed.aggregator.flush_jitter` [cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}) is configured and a changefeed's [`min_checkpoint_frequency`]({% link v23.2/create-changefeed.md %}#min-checkpoint-frequency) option is set to zero. [#125469][#125469]
- Fixed a bug where the public schema was erroneously created with its owner set to the `admin` role instead of the database owner. Ownership  of the public schema can be altered after the schema is created. [#125535][#125535]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2.0 where inserting rows into a [`REGIONAL BY ROW` table]({% link v23.2/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) could cause an internal error if the source was a `VALUES` clause with a single row and at least one boolean expression. [#126208][#126208]

<h3 id="v23-2-7-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The optimizer now generates more efficient query plans for some queries with [`OFFSET`]({% link v23.2/limit-offset.md %}#offset) clauses. [#124492][#124492]
