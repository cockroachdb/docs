## v23.2.1

Release Date: February 20, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Introduced the `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings), which is false by default. If set to `true`, then the values of the following settings will be redacted when accessed through `SHOW` commands or other introspection interfaces. In the future, any other sensitive cluster settings that are added will be redacted as well. Users who have the `MODIFYCLUSTERSETTING` [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/security-reference/authorization#managing-privileges) can always view the unredacted settings. [#117729][#117729]
    - `server.oidc_authentication.client_id`
    - `server.oidc_authentication.client_secret`
- If the `server.redact_sensitive_settings.enabled` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) is set to `true`, then the `MANAGEVIRTUALCLUSTER` [privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/security-reference/authorization#managing-privileges) is required to view the values of the per-virtual-cluster overrides for sensitive cluster settings. [#117729][#117729]
- The [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview) `session` cookie is now marked `HttpOnly` to prevent it from being read by any JavaScript code. [#119249][#119249]
- [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview) cookies are marked `Secure` for the browser when the cluster is running in secure mode. [#119249][#119249]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Updated Go version to 1.21.3. [#115339][#115339]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added a new [SQL function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/functions-and-operators) `fips_ready`, which can be used to verify the [FIPS](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/fips) readiness of the [gateway node](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction#gateway). [#115202][#115202]
- [Physical Cluster Replication (PCR)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview) now retries for approximately 3 minutes before failing. This is increased from 20 Âµs. [#116402][#116402]
- Fixed a bug where [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds) that targeted schema-locked tables could fail due to a very old highwater timestamp being incorrectly persisted. [#117961][#117961]
- Fixed a bug where creating a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds) that targeted tables with a [`DECIMAL(n)`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/decimal) column (i.e., zero-scale `DECIMAL` column), `format='avro'`, and `diff` would cause a panic. [#118895][#118895]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `sql.ttl.default_select_rate_limit` [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) and the `ttl_select_rate_limit` table [storage parameter](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/row-level-ttl#ttl-storage-parameters) to set the [TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/row-level-ttl) select rate limit. This sets the number of records per table per second per node that can be selected by the [TTL job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/row-level-ttl#view-scheduled-ttl-jobs). [#115801][#115801]
- Fixed a bug in [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) where altering the name of a [sequence](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-sequence) or [user-defined type (UDT)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-type) that was used in a PL/pgSQL [function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/user-defined-functions) or [procedure](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/stored-procedures) could break them. This bug was only present in v23.2 alpha and beta releases. [#116419][#116419]
- Added support for [`IMPORT INTO`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/import-into) on a table that has columns typed as [arrays](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/array) of [user-defined types](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-type) (like [enums](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/enum)). Tables that use multiple user-defined types with the same name but different [schemas](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-schema) are still unsupported. [#116359][#116359]
- The new [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/select-for-update) implementation used under [Read Committed isolation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/read-committed) (and under [Serializable isolation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/demo-serializable) when the `optimizer_use_lock_op_for_serializable` [session variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/session-variables) is `true`) now locks all [column families](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/column-families) instead of only the first column family. [#116826][#116826]
- Fixed a bug where [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/select-for-update) under [Read Committed isolation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/read-committed) on multi-column-family tables was not locking [column families](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/column-families) containing only key columns. [#116826][#116826]
- It is now possible to run [`CALL`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/call) statements with [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/explain). The `EXPLAIN (OPT)` variant will show the body of the procedure, while other variants will only show the procedure name and arguments. [#116274][#116274]
- [`EXPLAIN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/explain) output now contains detailed information about the plans for `CASCADE` actions. [#117719][#117719]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Per-node [hot ranges](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-hot-ranges-page) logging now logs the top 5 hot ranges on the local node instead of the top 5 hot ranges cluster-wide. [#118334][#118334]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Added a new command `cockroach debug enterprise-check-fips`, which diagnoses errors in [FIPS](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/fips) deployments. [#115202][#115202]
- The new flag `--enterprise-require-fips-ready` can be added to any [`cockroach` command](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cockroach-commands) to prevent startup if certain prerequisites for [FIPS](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/fips) compliance are not met. [#115202][#115202]
- [`cockroach workload`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cockroach-workload) commands now appropriately invoke `.Close` in the case of an error. [#116487][#116487]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Updated the "CPU Time" label on the [Runtime Dashboard](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-runtime-dashboard) to "SQL CPU Time" and added clarifications to its tooltip. [#116449][#116449]
- [Statement bundles](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-statements-page#diagnostics) are now enabled for Serverless clusters. [#117529][#117529]
- The [Networking Dashboard](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-networking-dashboard) is enhanced with charts that visualize number of packets received, number of receiving packets with error, number of receiving packets that got dropped, number of packets sent, number of sending packets with error, and number of sending packets that got dropped. [#116712][#116712]
- The [Explain Plans](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-statements-page#explain-plans) tab is now shown for the [Statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-statements-page) and [Insights](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-insights-page) pages, for Serverless clusters. [#118169][#118169]

<h3 id="v23-2-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a durability bug in [Raft log](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/replication-layer#raft) storage, caused by incorrect syncing of filesystem metadata. Previously, it was possible to lose writes of a particular kind (`AddSSTable`) that were used by e.g. [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/restore). This loss was possible only under power-off or operating system crash conditions. Under such conditions, CockroachDB could enter a crash loop on node restart. In the worst case of a coordinated power-off/crash across multiple nodes this could lead to an unrecoverable loss of [Raft quorum](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/replication-layer#raft). [#115709][#115709]
- Fixed a bug where large [jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/show-jobs) running with execution locality (such as some [changefeeds](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/changefeeds-in-multi-region-deployments#run-a-changefeed-job-by-locality)) could result in the [gateway](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction#gateway) node being assigned most of the work, causing performance degradation and cluster instability. [#115388][#115388]
- Fixed a bug that caused node crashes and panics when running [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/insert) queries on [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables with `UNIQUE` constraints or indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/alter-table#add-a-unique-index-to-a-regional-by-row-table). The bug was only present in v23.2.0-beta.1. [#115668][#115668]
- Fixed a bug that existed only in v23.2 alpha and beta versions that could have caused side effects to happen out of order for [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) routines in rare cases. [#115839][#115839]
- Fixed a bug that existed since v23.1 that prevented naming [user-defined type (UDT)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-type) parameters when dropping a [user-defined function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/user-defined-functions) (or procedure). [#115904][#115904]
- Fixed a bug where [scheduled jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/show-schedules) using [external storage providers](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-external-connection) could fail shortly after node startup. [#115693][#115693]
- Locking tables (e.g., with [`SELECT FOR UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/select-for-update)) on the null-extended side of [outer joins](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/joins) (e.g., the right side of a `LEFT JOIN`) is now disallowed and returns an error. This improves compatibility with PostgreSQL and prevents ambiguity in [locking semantics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/transaction-layer#concurrency-control). This bug has existed since locking with `FOR UPDATE` was introduced. [#115878][#115878]
- Fixed a display bug in the [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview) where because not all types of [schema changes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/online-schema-changes) are setting the value for the mutation ID, the value of the ID could previously show as "with ID undefined" on the [Events panel](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview-dashboard#events-panel). Now, the notification omits the undefined value (the rest of the event notification is still displayed). [#116518][#116518]
- Fixed the formatting for [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) routines, which could prevent creating a routine with [loop labels](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-procedure#create-a-stored-procedure-that-uses-a-while-loop), and could prevent some expressions from being [redacted](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/configure-logs#redact-logs) correctly. The bug only existed in v23.2 alpha and beta releases. [#116713][#116713]
- Fixed a bug that would cause a syntax error during [redaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/configure-logs#redact-logs) of a [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) routine. The bug existed only in v23.2 alpha and beta releases. [#116713][#116713]
- Fixed a bug that would cause syntax errors when attempting to [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/restore) a database with [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) [user-defined functions (UDFs)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/user-defined-functions) or [stored procedures](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/stored-procedures). This bug only affected v23.2 alpha and beta releases. [#116713][#116713]
- [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/update), [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/upsert), and [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/insert#on-conflict-clause) queries are now disallowed under [Read Committed isolation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/read-committed) when the table contains a [check constraint](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/check) involving a [column family](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/column-families) that is updated, and the check constraint also involves a column family that is **not** updated, but **is** read. This is a temporary fix to prevent possible violation of the check constraint, and the restriction will be lifted in the future. [#116428][#116428]
- Previously, all `AggHistogram`-powered metrics were not reporting quantiles properly in the [DB Console](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview). This patch fixes the histograms so that the quantiles in DB Console are reported correctly. these histograms were only broken in the [DB Console metrics dashboards](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview-dashboard), but were **not** broken in the [Prometheus-compatible endpoint](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/monitoring-and-alerting#prometheus-endpoint), `/_status/vars`. The list of affected metrics is shown below. [#114506][#114506]
  - `changefeed.message_size_hist`
  - `changefeed.parallel_io_queue_nanos`
  - `changefeed.sink_batch_hist_nanos`
  - `changefeed.flush_hist_nanos`
  - `changefeed.commit_latency`
  - `changefeed.admit_latency`
  - `jobs.row_level_ttl.span_total_duration`
  - `jobs.row_level_ttl.select_duration`
  - `jobs.row_level_ttl.delete_duration`
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2 that caused internal errors and panics when certain SQL queries were run with automatic [index recommendation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-databases-page#index-recommendations) collection enabled. [#117453][#117453]
- [Standard indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/indexes) and [inverted indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/inverted-indexes) may no longer be created on [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) `REFCURSOR[]`s columns. `REFCURSOR` columns themselves are not indexable. [#116071][#116071]
- Fixed a bug that prevented database [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/restore) when the database contained a [view](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/views) or [routine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-procedure) that referenced a [user-defined type (UDT)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-type) in the body string. For views, this bug was introduced in v20.2, when [user-defined types (UDTs)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-type) were introduced. For routines, this bug was introduced in v22.2, when user-defined functions (UDFs) were introduced. [#116841][#116841]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a function resolution error when attempting to use a [builtin function](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/functions-and-operators) like `now()` as a formatting argument to a [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) `RAISE` statement. [#116825][#116825]
- Fixed a bug where CDC custom key columns did not function correctly with [CDC queries](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds). For example, `CREATE CHANGEFEED WITH key_column=..., unordered AS SELECT * FROM table` now works correctly instead of retrying forever. Note that some functionalities with CDC custom keys are not fully supported, see [#115267][#115267] for more details. [#116967][#116967]
- Fixed a bug in [Raft log](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/replication-layer#raft) truncation that could lead to crash loops, and unrecoverable loss of [quorum](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/replication-layer#raft) in the unlikely worst case that all [replicas](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/overview#architecture-replica) enter this crash loop. The bug manifested when a few things coincided: The cluster was running a bulk write workload (e.g., [schema change](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/online-schema-changes), [import](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/copy), [`RESTORE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/restore)); a log truncation command was running; and the process crashed at an unfortunate moment (e.g., the process was killed, or killed itself for reasons like detecting a [disk stall](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting#disk-stalls)). [#116574][#116574]
- Fixed the value used for the total runtime on SQL statistics. This was using the wrong value previously, causing the [SQL Activity](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview#sql-activity) page to display values with more than 100%. [#117426][#117426]
- Fixed a bug where trying to set an empty `search_path` [session variable](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/session-variables) resulted in an error. [#117557][#117557]
- It is now possible to assign to the parameter of a [PL/pgSQL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/plpgsql) [routine](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-procedure). Previously, attempts to do this would result in a "variable not found" error at routine creation time. In addition, variable shadowing is now explicitly disabled, where previously it would cause an internal error. These bugs existed in the v23.2.0 release and the v23.2 pre-release versions. [#117715][#117715]
- Fixed a bug in the [row-level TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/row-level-ttl) [job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/show-schedules) that would cause it to skip expired rows if the [primary key](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/primary-key) of the table included columns of the [collated string](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/collate) type. This bug was present since the initial release of row-level TTL in v22.2.0. [#117512][#117512]
- Fixed a bug where concurrent [`GRANT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/grant) statements can cause deadlocks. [#117713][#117713]
- CockroachDB can now transparently retry more retryable errors when performing a non-atomic [`COPY`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/copy-from) command. [#117895][#117895]
- Fixed a bug that caused [DML statements](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/performance-best-practices-overview#dml-best-practices) to fail while a [hash-sharded index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/hash-sharded-indexes) was being created. The symptom of this bug was an error like `column "crdb_internal_val_shard_16" does not exist`. This bug was present since v23.1.0. [#118215][#118215]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter the error `unable to encode table key: *tree.DTSQuery` when operating on columns with the internal `TSQuery` type in some contexts (e.g., when collecting [table statistics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cost-based-optimizer#table-statistics) or when performing a [`DISTINCT` operation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/select-clause#eliminate-duplicate-rows)). This is now fixed. The bug had been present since v23.1 when support for the internal `TSQuery` type was added. [#118321][#118321]
- Previously, in some cases CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate queries that scanned an [inverted index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/inverted-indexes) and had a [`WHERE` filter](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/select-clause#where-clause) in which two sides of the `AND` expression had "similar" expressions (e.g., `ARRAY['str1'] <@ col AND (ARRAY['str1'] && col OR ...)`); this is now fixed. The bug had been present since prior to v22.2. [#118360][#118360]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/delete) queries sent by the [row-level TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/row-level-ttl) [job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/show-schedules) to use a [secondary index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/indexes) rather than the [primary index](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/primary-key) to find the rows to delete. This could lead to some `DELETE` operations taking a much longer time than they should. This bug was present since v22.2.0. [#118337][#118337]
- Fixed an issue with missing data on SQL statistics, and consequently missing data on the [SQL Activity page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overview#sql-activity), by properly recalculating the value from the current and past hour on the top activity table. [#118378][#118378]
- Internal queries issued by the [row-level TTL](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/row-level-ttl) [jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/show-schedules) should now use optimal plans. The bug has been present since at least v22.2. [#118494][#118494]
- Fixed a bug where a [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/change-data-capture-overview.html) could omit events in rare cases, logging the error `cdc ux violation: detected timestamp ... that is less or equal to the local frontier`. This could happen in the following scenario:
    1. A [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) runs on a follower [replica](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/glossary#cockroachdb-architecture-terms) that lags significantly behind the [leaseholder](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/glossary#cockroachdb-architecture-terms).
    1. A transaction commits and removes its [transaction record](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/transaction-layer#transaction-records) before its [intent](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/transaction-layer#writing) resolution is applied on the follower.
    1. The follower's [closed timestamp](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/transaction-layer#closed-timestamps) has advanced past the transaction commit timestamp.
    1. The rangefeed attempts to push the transaction to a new timestamp (at least 10 seconds after the transaction began).
    1. This may cause the rangefeed to prematurely emit a checkpoint before emitting writes at lower timestamps, which in turn may cause the [changefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/change-data-capture-overview#how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work) to drop these events entirely, never emitting them.
