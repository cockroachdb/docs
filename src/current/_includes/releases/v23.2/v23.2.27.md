<h3 id="v23-2-27-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `goschedstats.always_use_short_sample_period.enabled` cluster setting should be set to `true` for any serious production cluster; this will prevent unnecessary queuing in admission control CPU queues. [#146742][#146742]

<h3 id="v23-2-27-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could potentially cause a changefeed to complete erroneously when one of its watched tables encounters a schema change. [#147040][#147040]
- Fixed a bug that caused the SQL Activity > Statement Fingerprint page to fail to load details for statements run with application names containing a `#` character. [#147219][#147219]
- Fixed a bug that could cause the `cockroach` process to `segfault` when collecting runtime execution traces (typically collected via the **Advanced Debug** page in the Console). [#147339][#147339]
- Fixed a bug that could cause stable expressions to be folded in cached query plans. The bug could cause stable expressions like `current_setting` to return the wrong result if used in a prepared statement. The bug was introduced in v23.2.22, v24.1.14, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, and the v25.2 alpha. [#147456][#147456]

<h3 id="v23-2-27-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- TTL jobs now respond to cluster topology changes by restarting and rebalancing across available nodes. [#147224][#147224]
