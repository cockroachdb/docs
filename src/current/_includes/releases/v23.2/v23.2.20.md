<h3 id="v23-2-20-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Since v23.2, table statistics histograms have been collected for non-indexed JSON columns. Histograms are no longer collected for these columns if the `sql.stats.non_indexed_json_histograms.enabled` cluster setting is set to `false`. This reduces memory usage during table statistics collection, for both automatic and manual collection via `ANALYZE` and `CREATE STATISTICS`. [#140269][#140269]

- The `changefeed.max_behind_nanos` metric now supports scoping with metrics labels. [#139241][#139241]

- Previously, `SHOW CREATE TABLE` was showing incorrect data with regards to inverted indexes. It now shows the correct data that can be repeatedly entered back into CockroachDB to recreate the same table. [#138167][#138167]
- Fixed a bug where querying the `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` table while the schema changer was dropping a constraint could result in a query error. [#138286][#138286]
- Fixed a bounded memory leak that could occur when collecting table statistics on a table that had both very wide (10KiB or more) and relatively small (under 400B) `BYTES`-like values within the same row. This leak had been present since before v19.2. [#139177][#139177]
- Fixed a bug where changefeeds using CDC queries could have duplicate columns in the Parquet output. [#140155][#140155]
- Fixed a bug that prevented the `CREATE` statement for a routine from being included in a statement bundle when the routine was created on a schema other than `public`. The bug had existed since v23.1. [#140260][#140260]
