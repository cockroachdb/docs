<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The direct export of traces to Jaeger and the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `trace.jaeger.agent` have been removed. The direct export functionality had been obsoleted since 2022; it stopped working altogether sometime in 2023 with the following error: `data does not fit within one UDP packet; size 65006, max 65000, spans NN`. Since 2022, Jaeger supports ingestion of traces using OTLP; and CockroachDB has supported emitting traces using OTLP since v22.1. Operators and developers who want to inspect traces are thus invited to use the OTLP protocol instead. The corresponding cluster setting is `trace.opentelemetry.collector`. For a successful deployment, an intermediate OTLP collector/forwarder should be configured.
  - You can orchestrate the OpenTeletry collector and Jaeger together using Docker Compose by adapting the following example:

    ~~~ yaml
    otel-collector:
      image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
      container_name: otel-collector
      volumes:
        - ./otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
      ports:
        - 1888:1888 # pprof extension
        - 8888:8888 # Prometheus metrics exposed by the collector
        - 8889:8889 # Prometheus exporter metrics
        - 13133:13133 # health_check extension
        - 4317:4317 # OTLP gRPC receiver
        - 4318:4318 # OTLP http receiver
        - 55679:55679 # zpages extension

    jaeger:
      image: jaegertracing/all-in-one
      container_name: jaeger
      ports:
        - "16685:16685"
        - "16686:16686"
        - "14250:14250"
        - "14268:14268"
        - "14269:14269"
        - "6831:6831/udp"
      environment:
        - COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411
        - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
    ~~~

  - To configure the `otel-collector`, you can adapt this example:

    ~~~ yaml
    receivers:
      otlp: # the OTLP receiver the app is sending traces to
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:

    processors:
      batch:

    exporters:
      otlp/jaeger: # Jaeger supports OTLP directly
        endpoint: http://jaeger:4317
        tls:
          insecure: true

    service:
      pipelines:
        traces/dev:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp/jaeger]
    ~~~

  To use this configuration, unset Jaeger via `SET CLUSTER SETTING trace.jaeger.agent=''`, and then set the OTLP collector using `SET CLUSTER SETTING trace.opentelemetry.collector='localhost:4317'`.

- [Changefeeds](../v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html) now support the `confluent-cloud://` sink scheme. This scheme can be used to connect to Kafka hosted on Confluent Cloud. The scheme functions identically to Kafka, but it has it's own authentication parameters. Namely, it requires `api_key` and `api_secret` to be passed as parameters in the sink URI. They must be URL encoded. An example URI is: `'confluent-cloud://pkc-lzvrd.us-west4.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092?api_key=<KEY>&api_secret=<SECRET>'`. By default, the options `tls_enabled=true`, `sasl_handshake=true`, `sasl_enabled=true`, and `sasl_mechanism=PLAIN` are applied. For more information about authenticating with Confluent Cloud, see https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/security/security_tutorial.html#overview. The sink scheme still supports non-authentication parameters such as `topic_name` and `topic_prefix`. It also supports the standard Kafka changefeed options (ex. `kafka_sink_config`). [#111368][#111368]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [`RESTORE`](../v23.2/restore.html) option `strip_localities`, which was added in [#110606](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/110606), has been renamed to `remove_regions`. This option will lead to a "region-less restore"; it is used to strip the locality and region information from a backup when there are mismatched cluster regions between the backup's cluster and the target cluster. Note that a restore using this option will fail if the backup's cluster had [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v23.2/multiregion-overview.html#table-locality) table localities. This is because the `RESTORE` statement has a contract that all tables must be available to serve writes once it finishes. [#111356][#111356]
- Added initial support for executing the PLpgSQL `OPEN` statement, which allows a PLpgSQL routine to create a [cursor](../v23.2/cursors.html). Currently, opening bound or unnamed cursors is not supported. In addition, `OPEN` statements cannot be used in a routine with an exception block. [#110709][#110709]
- Added support for declaring bound [cursors](../v23.2/cursors.html), which associate a query with a cursor in a PLpgSQL routine before it is opened. [#111092][#111092]
- The `SELECT FOR SHARE` and `SELECT FOR KEY SHARE` statements previously did not acquire any locks. Users issuing these statements would expect them to acquire shared locks (multiple readers allowed, but no writers). This patch switches over the behavior to acquire such read locks when the user has selected the [`READ COMMITTED` isolation level](../v23.2/transactions.html#isolation-levels). For serializable transactions, we default to the previous behavior, unless the `enable_shared_locking_for_serializable` [session setting](../v23.2/set-vars.html) is set to `true`. [#109638][#109638]
- When a PLpgSQL exception handler catches an error, it now rolls back any changes to database state that occurred within the block. Exception blocks are not currently permitted to catch [`40001`](../v23.2/common-errors.html#restart-transaction) and [`40003`](../v23.2/common-errors.html#result-is-ambiguous) errors. [#110998][#110998]
- Added support for unnamed PLpgSQL [cursors](../v23.2/cursors.html), which generate a unique name when no cursor name was specified. [#111329][#111329]
- Fixed a bug that caused CockroachDB to stop collecting new statistics about [Statement fingerprints](../v23.2/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprint-page) and [Transaction fingerprints](../v23.2/ui-transactions-page.html). [#111613][#111613]
- Make the `max_event_frequency` [metric](../v23.2/metrics.html) visible for public documentation and usage. This is the maximum event frequency at which we sample executions for telemetry. [#111594][#111594]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the following [metrics](../v23.2/metrics.html) for [Raft](../v23.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#raft) proposals and reproposals: `raft.commands.proposed`, `raft.commands.reproposed.unchanged`, and `raft.commands.reproposed.new-lai`. [#111272][#111272]
- Removed the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `spanconfig.store.enabled` and the ability to use the `COCKROACH_DISABLE_SPAN_CONFIGS` environment variable. [#110253][#110253]
- Renamed the [metric](../v23.2/metrics.html) `fluent.sink.conn.errors` to `log.fluent.sink.conn.errors`. The addition of the `log.` prefix was to better group together logging-related metrics. The behavior and purpose of the metric remains unchanged. [#111126][#111126]
- Set the Metric Type metadata on the [metric](../v23.2/metrics.html) `log.fluent.sink.conn.errors`. Previously, the Metric Type was incorrectly left unset. Note that this is an update to the metric's metadata; the behavior and purpose of the metric remains unchanged. [#111126][#111126]
- Added a new [metric](../v23.2/metrics.html) `log.buffered.messages.dropped`. Buffered network logging sinks have a `max-buffer-size` attribute, which determines, in bytes, how many log messages can be buffered. Any `fluent-server` or `http-server` log sink that makes use of a `buffering` attribute in its configuration (enabled by default) qualifies as a buffered network logging sink. If this buffer becomes full, and an additional log message is sent to the buffered log sink, the buffer would exceed this `max-buffer-size`. Therefore, the buffered log sink drops older messages in the buffer to handle, in order to make room for the new. `log.buffered.messages.dropped` counts the number of messages dropped from the buffer. Note that the count is shared across all buffered logging sinks. [#111126][#111126]
- Added the [metric](../v23.2/metrics.html) `log.messages.count`. This metric measures the count of messages logged on the node since startup. Note that this does not measure the fan-out of single log messages to the various configured [logging sinks](../v23.2/configure-logs.html#set-logging-levels). This metric can be helpful in understanding log rates and volumes. [#111126][#111126]
- Added the `file-based-headers` field found in the `http-defaults` section of the log config, which accepts 'key-filepath' pairs. This allows values found at filepaths to be updated without restarting the cluster by sending `SIGHUP` to notify that values need to be refreshed. [#111235][#111235]
- Added the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `kv.snapshot.ingest_as_write_threshold`, which controls the size threshold below which snapshots are converted to regular writes. It defaults to `100KiB`. [#110943][#110943]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-cluster-virtualization">Cluster virtualization</h3>

- The name of the virtual cluster that the SQL client is connected to can now be inspected via the SQL [session variable](../v23.2/set-vars.html) `virtual_cluster_name`. [#111565][#111565]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The following [cluster settings](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) have been renamed; the previous names remain available for backward-compatibility. [#109415][#109415]

    | Previous name                         | New Name                                           |
    |---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
    | `server.shutdown.drain_wait`          | `server.shutdown.initial_wait`                     |
    | `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait` | `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_iteration.timeout` |
    | `server.shutdown.query_wait`          | `server.shutdown.transactions.timeout`             |
    | `server.shutdown.connection_wait`     | `server.shutdown.connections.timeout`              |
    | `server.shutdown.jobs_wait`           | `server.shutdown.jobs.timeout`                     |

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed an error on the [SQL Activity page](../v23.2/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) when there was a workload, and then the workload stopped so that no queries ran against the database in the last hour. [#111420][#111420]
- On the [Metrics page](../v23.2/ui-overview.html#metrics), now the information about which metric is used to create each chart is available on the chart's tooltip. [#111469][#111469]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed the error message that is returned when the user attempts to drop an [`ENUM`](../v23.2/enum.html) value that is used at least twice in an [`ARRAY`](../v23.2/array.html) column. [#111354][#111354]
- Added a check for values before using `mean` on the [Plan Details page](../v23.2/ui-statements-page.html), fixing a crash. [#111472][#111472]
- Fixed the metric name for `Schema Registry Registrations` on the [Metrics page](../v23.2/ui-overview.html#metrics). [#111469][#111469]
- Fixed a panic that could occur if a query used a [string](../v23.2/string.html) larger than 2^31-1 bytes. This was triggered by attempting to [import](../v23.2/import.html) a 2.7 GiB CSV file. [#111627][#111627]
- Fixed a bug where `atttypmod` in `pg_attribute` was not populated for [`TIMESTAMP`](../v23.2/timestamp.html) / [`INTERVAL`](../v23.2/interval.html) types, which meant that ORMs could not know the precision of these types properly. [#111400][#111400]
