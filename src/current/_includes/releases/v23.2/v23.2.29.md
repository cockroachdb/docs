<h3 id="v23-2-29-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare race condition between range splits and MVCC garbage collection where a GCRequest could target keys outside its declared span. In rare cases, this could result in data on the post-split right-hand side (RHS) being incorrectly garbage collected, potentially leading to lost writes. The system now detects and rejects such malformed GC requests. [#163775][#163775]
