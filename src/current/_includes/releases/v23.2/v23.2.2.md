<h3 id="v23-2-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [rangefeed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds#enable-rangefeeds) resolved timestamps could get stuck, continually emitting the log message `pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split`, typically following a [range merge](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/distribution-layer#range-merges). This bug was introduced in v23.2.1. [#119558][#119558]
