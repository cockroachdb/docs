## v23.2.5

Release Date: May 7, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The new [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) [`sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled`](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-stats-virtual-computed-columns-enabled) enables collection of [table statistics](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) on virtual [computed columns](../v23.2/computed-columns.html). [#120923][#120923]
- The new [session variable](../v23.2/session-variables.html) `optimizer_use_virtual_computed_column_stats` configures the [optimizer](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to consider table statistics on virtual computed columns. [#121179][#121179]
- The new `FORCE_INVERTED_INDEX` [hint](../v23.2/indexes.html#selection) configures the [optimizer](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to prefer a query plan scan over any inverted index of the hinted table. If no such query plan can be generated, an error is logged. [#122300][#122300]
- The [optimizer](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) can now plan constrained scans over [partial indexes](../v23.2/partial-indexes.html) in more cases, particularly on partial indexes with predicates referencing virtual [computed columns](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-stats-virtual-computed-columns-enabled). [#123408][#123408]

<h3 id="v23-2-5-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- A minimum [Raft](../v23.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#raft) scheduler concurrency is now enforced per [store](../v23.2/cockroach-start.html#storage) so that a node with many stores does not spread workers too thinly. This avoids high scheduler latency across [replicas](../v23.2/architecture/glossary.html#replica) on a store when load is imbalanced. [#120798][#120798]
- A [changefeed](../v23.2/change-data-capture-overview.html) optimization to reduce duplicates during aggregator restarts has been disabled due to poor performance. [#123596][#123596]

<h3 id="v23-2-5-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The **Commit Latency** chart in the [Changefeed Dashboard](../v23.2/ui-cdc-dashboard.html) now aggregates by max instead of by sum for multi-node changefeeds. This more accurately reflects the amount of time for events to be acknowledged by the downstream sink. [#121235][#121235]

<h3 id="v23-2-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a slow memory leak when opening many new [connections](../v23.2/connect-to-the-database.html). This bug was introduced in v22.2.9 and v23.1.0. [#121055][#121055]
- Fixed a bug that occurred when using [`ALTER TABLE`](../v23.2/alter-table.html) to drop and re-add a [`CHECK` constraint](../v23.2/check.html) with the same name. [#121055][#121055]
- [Sequence](../v23.2/create-sequence.html) options `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` automatically adjust to new types bounds. This mirrors the behavior of PostgreSQL. [#121309][#121309]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent timeseries graphs shown on the DB Console SQL Activity [Statement Details](../v23.2/ui-statements-page.html) page from rendering correctly when specifying a custom time range. [#121383][#121383]
- Fixed a bug present since at least v21.1 that could lead to incorrect evaluation of an `IN` expression with:
    - [`INT2` or `INT4`](../v23.2/int.html) type on the left side, and
    - Values on the right side that are outside of the range of the left side.

    [#121953][#121953]
- Fixed a leak in reported memory usage (not the actual memory usage) by the internal memory accounting system, the limit for which is configured via the [`--max-sql-memory`](../v23.2/cockroach-start.html#flags) flag when a long-running sessions issues hundreds of thousands or more [transactions](../v23.2/transactions.html). This reporting bug could cause `root: memory budget exceeded` errors for other queries. The bug was introduced in v23.1.17 and v23.2.3. [#121950][#121950]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2.4 that could prevent collection of [table statistics](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) on tables that have on virtual [computed columns](../v23.2/computed-columns.html) of [user-defined type](../v23.2/create-type.html) when the newly-introduced [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) [`sql.stats.virtual_computed_columns.enabled`](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html#setting-sql-stats-virtual-computed-columns-enabled) is set to `true` (defaults to `false`). The setting was introduced in v23.2.4 and is disabled by default. [#122319][#122319]
- Fixed a bug where a [`GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES`](../v23.2/grant.html) statement could fail if a sequence existed that did not support the [privilege](../v23.2/security-reference/authorization.html#privileges) being granted. [#122034][#122034]
- Fixed an existing bug where an unused value cannot be dropped from an [`ENUM`](../v23.2/enum.html) if the`ENUM` itself is referenced by a [user-defined function](../v23.2/user-defined-functions.html). A value can now be dropped from an`ENUM` as long as the value itself is not being referenced by any other data element, including a user-defined function. [#121237][#121237]
