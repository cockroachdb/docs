## v23.2.9

Release Date: August 1, 2024

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-9-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`]({% link v23.2/explain-analyze.md %}) statements are now supported when executed via Cloud Console [SQL shell]({% link cockroachcloud/sql-shell.md %}). [#125562][#125562]
- Added the [`sql.auth.grant_option_inheritance.enabled` cluster setting]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-auth-grant-option-inheritance-enabled). The default value is `true`, which maintains consistency with CockroachDB's previous behavior: users granted a privilege with [`WITH GRANT OPTION`]({% link v23.2/grant.md %}) can in turn grant that privilege to others. When `sql.auth.grant_option_inheritance.enabled` is set to `false`, the `GRANT OPTION` is not inherited through role membership, thereby preventing descendant roles from granting the privilege to others. However, the privilege itself continues to be inherited through role membership. [#126298][#126298]

<h3 id="v23-2-9-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- `crdb_internal.cluster_execution_insights.txt` and `crdb_internal.cluster_txn_execution_insights.txt` have been removed from the [debug zip]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}). These files contained cluster-wide insights for statements and transactions. Users can still rely on the [per-node execution]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}#files) insights in `crdb_internal.node_execution_insights.txt` and `crdb_internal.node_txn_execution_insights.txt`. [#125804][#125804]
- Some debugging-only information about physical plans is no longer collected in the `system.job_info` table for [changefeeds]({% link v23.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}), because it has the potential to grow very large. [#126097][#126097]
- For the [TELEMETRY channel]({% link v23.2/logging.md %}#telemetry), TCL [`sampled_query`]({% link v23.2/eventlog.md %}#sampled_query) events will now be sampled at the rate specified by the setting [`sql.telemetry.query_sampling.max_event_frequency`]({% link v23.2/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-telemetry-query-sampling-max-event-frequency), which is already used to limit the rate of sampling DML statements. [#126728][#126728]

<h3 id="v23-2-9-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.2.0 in which CockroachDB would hit an internal error when evaluating [`INSERT`s]({% link v23.2/insert.md %}) into [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link v23.2/alter-table.md %}#set-the-table-locality-to-regional-by-row) tables where the source was a [`VALUES`]({% link v23.2/selection-queries.md %}#values-clause) clause with a single row and at least one boolean expression. [#125504][#125504] [#126839][#126839]
- Fixed a bug where a [`DROP ROLE`]({% link v23.2/drop-role.md %}) or [`DROP USER`]({% link v23.2/drop-user.md %}) command could leave references behind inside types, which could prevent subsequent [`SHOW GRANTS`]({% link v23.2/show-grants.md %}) commands from working. [#125806][#125806]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to descriptors having privileges to roles that no longer exist. Added an automated clean up for [dropped roles]({% link v23.2/drop-role.md %}) inside descriptors. [#125806][#125806]
- Fixed a bug where a change to a [user-defined type (UDT)]({% link v23.2/create-type.md %}) could cause queries against tables using that type to fail with an error message like: `histogram.go:694: span must be fully contained in the bucket`. The change to the user-defined type could occur either directly from an [`ALTER TYPE`]({% link v23.2/alter-type.md %}) statement or indirectly from an [`ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION`]({% link v23.2/alter-database.md %}#add-region) or [`ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION`]({% link v23.2/alter-database.md %}#drop-region) statement, which implicitly modifies the `crdb_internal_region` UDT. This bug had existed since UDTs were introduced in v20.2. [#125806][#125806]
- Fixed a bug in which constant `LIKE` patterns containing certain sequences of backslashes did not become constrained scans. This bug has been present since v21.1.13 when support for building constrained scans from `LIKE` patterns containing backslashes was added. [#125538][#125538]
- Fixed a bug introduced in alpha versions of v23.1 where calling a routine could result in an unexpected `function ... does not exist` error. The bug is triggered when the routine is called twice using the exact same SQL query, and either: (a) the routine has polymorphic arguments, or: (b) between the two calls, the routine is replaced by a routine with the same name and different parameters. [#123518][#123518]
- Fixed the statistics estimation code in the [optimizer]({% link v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}) so it does not use the empty histograms produced if [histogram collection]({% link v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#control-histogram-collection) has been disabled during stats collection due to excessive memory utilization. Now the optimizer will rely on distinct counts instead of the empty histograms and should produce better plans as a result. This bug has existed since v22.1. [#126156][#126156]
- Fixed a bug in [`cockroach debug tsdump`]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-tsdump.md %}) where the command fails when a custom SQL port is used and the [`--format=raw`]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-tsdump.md %}#flags) flag is provided. [#126184][#126184]
- Fixed a bug where a [user-defined function (UDF)]({% link v23.2/user-defined-functions.md %}) that shared a name with a [built-in function]({% link v23.2/functions-and-operators.md %}#built-in-functions) would not be resolved, even if the UDF had higher precedence according to the [`search_path`]({% link v23.2/sql-name-resolution.md %}#search-path) variable. [#126295][#126295]
- Fixed a bug that caused [background jobs]({% link v23.2/show-jobs.md %}) to incorrectly respect a statement timeout. [#126819][#126819]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER DATABASE ... DROP REGION`]({% link v23.2/alter-database.md %}#drop-region) could fail if any tables under the given database have [indexes on expressions]({% link v23.2/expression-indexes.md %}). [#126598][#126598]
- Fixed a bug when [restoring]({% link v23.2/restore.md %}) a database with a [composite type]({% link v23.2/create-type.md %}#create-a-composite-data-type). [#126841][#126841]
- Fixed a bug when inputting `public` role as user name for [built-in compatibility functions]({% link v24.2/functions-and-operators.md %}#compatibility-functions), such as `has_database_privilege` and `has_schema_privilege`. [#126852][#126852]
- Fixed a bug where the [Database page]({% link v23.2/ui-databases-page.md %}) could crash if range information is not available. [#127091][#127091]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate an [`IS NOT NULL`]({% link v23.2/null-handling.md %}#nulls-and-simple-comparisons) filter if it was applied to non-`NULL` tuples that had `NULL` elements, such as `(1, NULL)` or `(NULL, NULL)`. This bug has existed since v20.2. [#126937][#126937]
- In the [DB Console event log]({% link v23.2/ui-overview-dashboard.md %}#events-panel), [`ALTER ROLE`]({% link v23.2/alter-role.md %}) events now display correctly even when no [role options]({% link v23.2/alter-role.md %}#role-options) are included in the `ALTER ROLE` statement. [#126565][#126565]
- Fixed a bug where [`CREATE TABLE`]({% link v23.2/create-table.md %}) with [index expressions]({% link v23.2/expression-indexes.md %}) could hit undefined column errors on [transaction retries]({% link v23.2/transactions.md %}#transaction-retries). [#126201][#126201]

<h3 id="v23-2-9-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- [Schema changes]({% link v23.2/online-schema-changes.md %}) that cause a data backfill, such as adding a non-nullable column or changing the primary key, will now split and scatter the temporary indexes used to perform the change. This reduces the chance of causing a write hotspot that can slow down foreground traffic. [#126691][#126691]
