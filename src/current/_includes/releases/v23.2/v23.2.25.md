<h3 id="v23-2-25-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `WITH IGNORE_FOREIGN_KEYS` option to `SHOW CREATE TABLE` which omits foreign key constraints from the output schema. This option is also allowed in `SHOW CREATE VIEW`, but has no effect. It cannot be combined with the `WITH REDACT` option.

<h3 id="v23-2-25-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would encounter an internal error when decoding the gists of plans with `CALL` statements. The bug had been present since v23.2.
 [#143312][#143312]
- Fixed a bug that caused changefeeds to fail on startup when scanning a single key.
 [#143147][#143147]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a stack overflow during execution of a prepared statement that invoked a PL/pgSQL routine with a loop. The bug existed in versions v23.2.22, v24.1.15, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, v25.1.3, and pre-release versions of v25.2 prior to v25.2.0-alpha.3.
 [#144029][#144029]
- Fixed a bug that could leave behind a dangling reference to a dropped role if that role had default privileges granted to itself. The bug was caused by defining privileges such as: `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE self_referencing_role GRANT INSERT ON TABLES TO self_referencing_role`.
 [#143291][#143291]
- MVCC garbage collection is now fully subject to IO admission control. Previously, it was possible for MVCC GC to cause store overload (such as LSM inversion) when a large amount of data would become eligible for garbage collection. Should any issues arise from subjecting MVCC GC to admission control, the `kv.mvcc_gc.queue_kv_admission_control.enabled` cluster setting can be set to `false` to restore the previous behavior.
