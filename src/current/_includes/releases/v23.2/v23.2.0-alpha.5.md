- Added support for the special `OTHERS` condition in PLpgSQL exception blocks, which allows matching any error code apart from `query_canceled` and `assert_failure`. Note that Class 40 errors (40000, 40001, 40003, 40002, and 40P01) cannot be caught either, tracked in #111446. [#112817][#112817]

- Queries with the `st_union` aggregate function could produce incorrect results in some cases due to the query optimizer performing invalid optimizations. This bug has been present since the `st_union` function was introduced in version 20.2.0. [#112780][#112780]
