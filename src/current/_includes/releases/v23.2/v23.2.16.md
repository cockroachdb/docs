<h3 id="v23-2-15-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Changed the license `cockroach` is distributed under to the new CockroachDB Software License (CSL). [#131705][#131705] [#131927][#131927] [#131933][#131933] [#131981][#131981] [#131988][#131988] [#131994][#131994] [#131992][#131992] [#132000][#132000] [#132001][#132001] [#131999][#131999] [#132053][#132053] [#132803][#132803] [#132781][#132781]
- The cluster setting `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` is now ignored if the cluster has a Enterprise Trial or Enterprise Free license, or if the reporting job is unable to load any license at all. [#132461][#132461]
- Added the sink error metric (`changefeed.sink_errors`) and expanded the reporting of the internal retries metric (`changefeed.internal_retry_message_count`) to all changefeed sinks that perform internal retries. [#132569][#132569]
- Allowed access to DB console APIs via JWT, which can be supplied as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. [#133240][#133240]

<h3 id="v23-2-15-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- DB Console will reflect any throttling behavior from the cluster due to an expired license or missing telemetry data. Enterprise licenses are not affected. [#131859][#131859]
- Due to the inaccuracy of the **Range Count** column on the **Databases** page, and the cost incurred to fetch the correct range count for every database in a cluster, this data will no longer be visible. This data is still available via a `SHOW RANGES` query. [#133271][#133271]

<h3 id="v23-2-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an error that could happen if an aggregate function was used as the value in a `SET` command. [#131958][#131958]
- Added automated clean-up/validation for dropped roles inside of default privileges. [#132169][#132169]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `RESTORE` to hang after encountering transient errors from the storage layer. [#132260][#132260]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect evaluation of `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `IF` expressions with branches producing fixed-width string-like types, such as `CHAR`. In addition, the `BPCHAR` type has been fixed so that it no longer incorrectly imposes a length limit of `1`. [#130898][#130898]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to incorrect results in rare cases. The bug requires a `JOIN` between two tables, with an equality between columns with equivalent, but not identical types (e.g., `OID` and `REGCLASS`). In addition, the `JOIN` must lookup an index that includes a computed column that references one of the equivalent columns. This bug has existed since before v23.1. [#132510][#132510]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to incorrect results in rare cases. The bug requires a lookup join into a table with a computed index column, where the computed column expression is composite sensitive. A composite sensitive expression can compare differently if supplied non-identical, but equivalent input values (e.g. `2.0::DECIMAL` vs `2.00::DECIMAL`). This bug has existed since before v23.1. [#132510][#132510]
- Fixed a bug where a span stats request on a mixed-version cluster resulted in an NPE. [#132683][#132683]
- The `franz-go` library has been updated to fix a potential deadlock on changefeed restarts. [#132784][#132784]
- Fixed an issue where changefeeds would fail to update protected timestamp records in the face of retryable errors. [#132774][#132774]
- Fixed a bug that could result in changefeeds using CDC queries failing due to a system table being garbage collected. [#131655][#131655]
- Fixed a rare bug in which an update of a primary key column that is also the only column in a separate column family can sometimes fail to update the primary index. This bug has existed since v22.2. Requirements to hit the bug are:  
    1. A table with multiple column families. 
    2. A column family containing a single primary key column.
    3. That column family is not the first column family. 
    4. That column family existed before its column was in the primary key. 
    5. That column must be of type `FLOAT4/8`, `DECIMAL`, `JSON`, collated string type, or array. 
    6. An update that changes that column from a composite value to a non-composite value. [#132123][#132123]
- The `proretset` column of the `pg_catalog.pg_proc` table is now properly set to `true` for set-returning builtin functions. [#132874][#132874]
- Fixed a bug in the query optimizer that could cause CockroachDB nodes to crash in rare cases. The bug could occur when a query contains a filter in the form `col IN (elem0, elem1, ..., elemN)` only when `N` is very large, e.g., 1.6+ million, and when `col` exists in a hash-sharded index or, exists in a table with an indexed, computed column dependent on `col`. [#133066][#133066]
- Users with the `admin` role can now run `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR target_role ...` on any `target_role`. Previously, this could result in a privilege error, which is incorrect as admins are allowed to perform any operation. [#133069][#133069]
- `REASSIGN OWNED BY` will now transfer ownership of the `public` schema. Previously, it would always skip over the `public` schema even if it was owned by the target role. [#133069][#133069]
- Added a timer for inner changefeed sink client flushes. Fixed a bug where timers were not correctly registered with the metric system. [#133255][#133255]
- Fixed an error that could be caused by using an `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` expression that references a user-defined (or unknown) type name. These kinds of expressions are invalid, but previously the error was not handled properly. This will now return the correct error message. [#132453][#132453]
- Fixed a bug where backup schedules could advance a protected timestamp too early, which caused incremental backups to fail. [#131389][#131389]

<h3 id="v23-2-15-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Performance has been improved during periodic polling of table history when the `schema_locked` table storage parameter is not enabled. [#132240][#132240]
- Reduced the write-amplification impact of rebalances by splitting snapshot SSTable files into smaller ones before ingesting them into Pebble. [#134526][#134526]
