<h3 id="v23-2-21-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Since v23.2 table statistics histograms have been collected for non-indexed JSON columns. Histograms are no longer collected for these columns if `sql.stats.non_indexed_json_histograms.enabled` is set to false. This reduces memory usage during table statistics collection, for both automatic and manual collection via ANALYZE and CREATE STATISTICS. [#140144][#140144]

- Addressed a bug due to which, under rare circumstances, draining a node could fail with "some sessions did not respond to cancellation within 1s". [#139479][#139479]
- Fixed a bug that prevented the create statement for a routine from being shown in a statement bundle. This happened when the routine was created on a schema other than `public`. The bug has existed since v23.1. [#136131][#136131]
- Bounded memory leak that could previously occur when evaluating some memory-intensive queries via the vectorized engine in CockroachDB has now been fixed. The leak has been present since 20.2 version. [#139098][#139098]
