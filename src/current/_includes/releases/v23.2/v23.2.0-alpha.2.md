## v23.2.0-alpha.2

Release Date: October 2, 2023

{% include releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The `SIGHUP` signal now clears the cached expiration times for [client certificates](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cockroach-cert#how-security-certificates-work) that are reported by the `security.certificate.expiration.client` metric. [#110726][#110726]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Increased the maximum permitted value of the `COCKROACH_RPC_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` environment variable to 64MB. In conjunction with tuning your operating system's maximum TCP window size, this can increase the throughput that Raft replication can sustain over high latency network links. [#111255][#111255]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The `discard` [log message](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/logging-overview) is now limited to once per minute by default. The message now includes both the number of transactions and the number of statements that were discarded. [#110805][#110805]
- The [cluster setting](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) `kv.rangefeed.enabled` no longer controls access to `RANGEFEED SQL` commands. Instead, use `feature.changefeed.enabled`. [#110676][#110676]
- SQL commands that were previously limited to the `admin` [system privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/security-reference/authorization#supported-privileges) can now be used by users with the `VIEWCLUSTERMETADATA` or `REPAIRCLUSTERMETADATA` system privilege, depending on whether the operation is read-only or modifies state. [#110084][#110084]
- Added a `last_error` column to the `cluster_execution_insights`, `node_execution_insights`, `cluster_txn_execution_insights`, and `node_txn_execution_insights` tables. These columns contain error messages for failed executions. [#110565][#110565]
- The new backup option `updates_cluster_monitoring_metrics` tracks the timestamp of the last backup failure due to a KMS error. This option is disabled by default. [#104634][#104634]
- The new restore option `strip_localities` optionally strips the locality information from a backup when restoring to a cluster with different regions than the source cluster.

  Restoring a cluster or database that contains regional-by-row tables, or restoring a regional-by-row table, requires you to modify the database:

  - To restore a cluster with regional-by-row tables, you must drop the zone config of the database, then drop the type `d.public.crdb_internal_region`.
  - To restore a database that contains regional-by-row tables, or to restore a regional-by-row table, you must drop the type `d.public.crdb_internal_region`.
  - You must alter the `crdb_region` column to set the default region for newly-written rows.
  - You must discard the previous zone config, which contains outdated information, such as that related to the partitions and constraints after the restore. This column specifies each row's home region and is a prefix to the table's primary key. Stripping localities does not modify this column, because it would require the entire table to be written.

  This change is part of a larger effort, and this feature is subject to change.

  [#110606][#110606]

- Added a check to disallow queries that use predicate locking, since explicit uniqueness checks are not yet supported under Read Committed isolation. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `UPSERT` statements against some `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables will fail under Read Committed isolation with the following error:

  ~~~ shell
  unimplemented: explicit unique checks are not yet supported under read committed isolation SQLSTATE: 0A000
  ~~~

    For more details about which `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables are affected, refer to [Issue #110873](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/110873).

    [#110879][#110879]
- The `created` field produced by `SHOW STATISTICS` has been updated from `TIMESTAMP` to `TIMESTAMPTZ`. Statistic creation times are now displayed in the session time zone if it is set. [#110753][#110753]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Removed the node-level `engine.stalls` timeseries metric. This metric has not been updated for several releases. [#110936][#110936]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The legend is now always displayed on charts in DB Console Metrics pages. In addition, when you select an item from the legend that represents a single line in the chart, that line is selected in the chart. [#110809][#110809]
- When collecting a [statement bundle](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cockroach-statement-diag), you can now filter by a specific [plan gist](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-statements-page#explain-plans) or collect diagnostics for all plan gists. [#110931][#110931]
- [Statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-statements-page) and [Transaction](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-transactions-page) detail pages now include an **Error Message** row. Users with the `VIEWACTIVITY` [system privilege](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/security-reference/authorization#supported-privileges) can view the full error message, and users with the `VIEWACTIVTYREDACTED` system privilege can view the redacted error message. If a user has both privileges, `VIEWACTIVITYTREDACTED`` takes precedence. [#110849][#110849]
- A new dashboard in the [SQL Dashboard page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-sql-dashboard) tracks how often distributed queries with errors were rerun using the "rerun as local" mechanism, as well as how often those reruns failed. the number of times distributed queries that resulted in errors were rerun as local as well as when those reruns failed. The "rerun as local" mechanism is new in v23.2 and is enabled by default. For more information, contact your Cockroach Labs account representative. [#110619][#110619]
- The DB Console [Insights page](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-insights-page) now shows the error message when a transaction fails at the `COMMIT` stage. [#110898][#110898]
- The [Overload Dashboard page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-overload-dashboard) now includes the following graphs to monitor [admission control](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/admission-control.html):
    - **IO Overload** - Charts normalized metric based on admission control target thresholds. Replaces **LSM L0 Health** graph which used raw metrics.
    - **KV Admission Slots Exhausted** - Replaces **KV Admission Slots** graph.
    - **Flow Tokens Wait Time: 75th percentile** - Use to monitor the new replication admission control feature.
    - **Requests Waiting For Flow Tokens** - Use to monitor the new replication admission control feature.
    - **Blocked Replication Streams** - Use to monitor the new replication admission control feature.

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a race condition in the [Replica lifecycle](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/architecture/replication-layer) that could result in a failed SQL request when the request could have been successfully retried. [#110806][#110806]
- Fixed a bug where a [`CREATE TABLE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/create-table) command with an `IDENTITY` column did not properly propagate the type of the column into the sequence. [#110621][#110621]
- Fixed a panic when decoding a gist in a foreign database that does not contain a table referred to by the gist. [#110966][#110966]
- A synthetic `dropped` column have been added to the `pg_attribute` table. This column tracks the attribution numbers for dropped attributions, to work around issues with ORMs that are not designed to handle gaps in attribution numbering in the `pg_attribute` table. [#111019][#111019]
- Fixed a rare internal error in the `unnest` and `information_schema._pg_expandarray` [built-in functions](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/functions-and-operators) where passed string arguments could be cast to an array. [#110956][#110956]
- External connection URLs now accept the scheme `azure-blob` for connections to Azure Blob Storage and the scheme `azure-kms` for connections to Azure KMS. For backward compatibility, schemes `azure` and `azure-storage` schemes continue to work for connections to Azure Blob Storage. [#111217][#111217]
- Fixed a bug where vectorized `COPY FROM` could produce a plan with more than one RenderNodes, when only zero or one should be allowed. This could result in multiple render nodes in a table with a hash sharded primary key. [#111284][#111284]
- Fixed a bug in DB Console's Statement Diagnostic page that could cause the page to crash if the response was larger than 50 KB. The page now keeps pulling results until no maximum size errors are encountered. [#111128][#111128]
- Fixed a bug where DB Console instances proxied at different subpaths that use OIDC pointed to an incorrect relative OIDC login path. [#111240][#111240]
- Fixed a bug where changing the setting `server.telemetry.hot_ranges_stats.interval` had no effect. [#111305][#111305]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-alpha-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Fixed a performance bug that could result in rewriting a 128-MB file each time a store file is created, renamed, or removed when [Encryption At Rest](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/security-reference/encryption#encryption-at-rest) is enabled on a large store with many small files. [#111069][#111069]
- Improved compaction heuristics to mitigate read amplification growth and admission control throttling when processing large deletes, such as during node decommissioning, replica rebalancing, or when dropping tables. [#111277][#111277]
