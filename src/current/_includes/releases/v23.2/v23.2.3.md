## v23.2.3

Release Date: March 20, 2024

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-3-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The [DB Console](../v23.2/ui-overview.html) `session` cookie is now marked `HttpOnly` to prevent it from being read by any Javascript code. Cookies are also marked `Secure` for the browser when the cluster is running in secure mode. [#119259][#119259]
- Clusters using [Cluster Single Sign-on (SSO) with JSON web tokens (JWTs)](../v23.2/sso-sql.html) can now optionally fetch signing keys from configured issuers instead of configuring static signing keys for each issuer. When the new cluster setting `server.jwt_authentication.jwks_auto_fetch.enabled` is set to `true`, signing keys are automatically fetched from the issuer using metadata published in its OpenID configuration. In this case, static signing keys in `server.jwt_authentication.jwks` are ignored. When automatic fetching is enabled, there may be a slight increase in network latency for each JWT authentication request, proportional to the latency between the cluster and the issuer's endpoint. [#119768][#119768]

<h3 id="v23-2-3-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where creating a changefeed with the [`format='avro'`](../v23.2/create-changefeed.html#format) and [`diff`](../v23.2/create-changefeed.html#diff-opt) options that targeted tables with a `DECIMAL(n)` column (i.e., zero-scale `DECIMAL` column) would cause a panic. [#118847][#118847]

<h3 id="v23-2-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Changed the `sql.index_recommendation.drop_unused_duration` cluster setting to `public` so that it is documented on the [Cluster Settings](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) page. [#118764][#118764]
- Added the `server.max_open_transactions_per_gateway` [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html). When set to a non-negative value, non-admin users cannot execute a query if the number of transactions open on the current gateway node is already at the configured limit. [#118933][#118933]
- Out-of-process SQL servers will now start exporting a new `sql.aggregated_livebytes` [metric](../v23.2/metrics.html). This metric gets updated once every 60 seconds by default, and its update interval can be configured via the `tenant_global_metrics_exporter_interval` [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html). [#119371][#119371]
- Added support for index hints with [`INSERT`](../v23.2/insert.html) and [`UPSERT`](../v23.2/upsert.html) statements. This allows `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` and `UPSERT` queries to use index hints in the same way they are already supported for [`UPDATE`](../v23.2/update.html) and [`DELETE`](../v23.2/delete.html) statements. [#119601][#119601]

<h3 id="v23-2-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Expanded the [`--include-range-info`](../v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html) flag to include problem ranges. This flag still defaults to `true`. [#119234][#119234]
- In unredacted [debug zips](../v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html), the `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` table file has two new columns:
    - `waiting_stmt_query`: the query of the waiting statement.
    - `blocking_txn_queries_unordered`: the unordered list of the blocking transaction's queries. [#118831][#118831]

<h3 id="v23-2-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Updated the SQL shell help URL to point to the [`cockroach sql`](../v23.2/cockroach-sql.html) page. [#118994][#118994]
- [`cockroach debug tsdump`](../v23.2/cockroach-debug-tsdump.html) creates a `tsdump.yaml` file. The `tsdump` raw format automatically creates the YAML file in the default location `/tmp/tsdump.yaml`. Added a new flag `--yaml` that allows users to specify the path to create `tsdump.yaml` instead of using the default location. For example, `cockroach debug tsdump --host <host>:<port> \ --format raw --yaml=/some_path/tsdump.yaml > /some_path/tsdump.gob`.[#117741][#117741]

<h3 id="v23-2-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where a warning about the need to refresh data would remain displayed on the Active Executions view of the [Statements](../v23.2/ui-statements-page.html#active-executions-view) and [Transactions](../v23.2/ui-transactions-page.html#active-executions-view) pages despite enabling **Auto Refresh**. [#118703][#118703]
- Updated the [Statement Details page](../v23.2/ui-statements-page.html) to always show the entire selected period, instead of just the period that had data. [#118805][#118805]
- The [Overload dashboard](../v23.2/ui-overload-dashboard.html) now includes two additional graphs:
    - **Elastic CPU Utilization**: displays the CPU utilization by elastic work, compared to the limit set for elastic work.
    - **Elastic CPU Exhausted Duration Per Second**: displays the duration of CPU exhaustion by elastic work, in microseconds. [#118896][#118896]
- The **Full Table/Index Scans** chart in the [SQL Metrics dashboard](../v23.2/ui-sql-dashboard.html) now shows the non-negative derivative of the number of full scans tracked. [#118860][#118860]

<h3 id="v23-2-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where a [changefeed](../v23.2/change-data-capture-overview.html) could omit events in rare cases, logging the error `cdc ux violation: detected timestamp ... that is less or equal to the local frontier`. This could happen in the following scenario:
    1. A [rangefeed](../v23.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) runs on a follower [replica](../v23.2/architecture/glossary.html#cockroachdb-architecture-terms) that lags significantly behind the [leaseholder](../v23.2/architecture/glossary.html#cockroachdb-architecture-terms).
    1. A transaction commits and removes its transaction record before its [intent](../v23.2/architecture/transaction-layer.html#writing) resolution is applied on the follower.
    1. The follower's [closed timestamp](../v23.2/architecture/transaction-layer.html#closed-timestamps) has advanced past the transaction commit timestamp.
    1. The rangefeed attempts to push the transaction to a new timestamp (at least 10 seconds after the transaction began).
    1. This may cause the rangefeed to prematurely emit a checkpoint before emitting writes at lower timestamps, which in turn may cause the [changefeed](../v23.2/how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work.html) to drop these events entirely, never emitting them. [#118413][#118413]
- Decommissioning replicas that are part of a mis-replicated range will no longer get stuck on a rebalance operation that was falsely determined to be unsafe. This bug was introduced in v23.1.0. [#118343][#118343]
- CockroachDB will no longer spam the logs with `unable to get CPU capacity` errors every 10 seconds when running outside of a CPU cgroup. [#118672][#118672]
- [`AUTO CREATE STATS`](../v23.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) jobs could previously lead to growth in an internal system table resulting in slower job-system related queries. [#118942][#118942]
- Fixed a bug that caused an inscrutable error when a [sequence](../v23.2/create-sequence.html) name allocated by `SERIAL` conflicted with an existing type name. [#118947][#118947]
- Fixed an internal error with a message like: `LeafTxn ... incompatible with locking request` that occurs when performing an update under [`READ COMMITTED` isolation](../v23.2/read-committed.html) that cascades to a table with multiple other foreign keys. [#118931][#118931]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v23.2/alter-table.html#alter-primary-key) could fail with an error `non-nullable column <x> with no value! Index scanned ..` when validating recreated [secondary indexes]({% link v23.2/schema-design-indexes.md %}). [#118974][#118974]
- Fixed a bug where [`COMMENT ON`](../v23.2/comment-on.html) statements could fail with an `unexpected value` error if multiple `COMMENT` statements were running concurrently. [#119020][#119020]
- Previously, in certain cases, using virtual tables such as `crdb_internal.system_jobs` could result in the internal error `attempting to append refresh spans after the tracked timestamp has moved forward`. This is now fixed. The bug was introduced in CockroachDB v23.1. [#119184][#119184]
- Fixed a bug where operations on the `crdb_internal.leases` table could cause a node to become unavailable due to a deadlock in the leasing subsystem. [#119341][#119341]
- Fixed a bug where rangefeed resolved timestamps could get stuck, continually emitting the log message `pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split`, typically following a [range merge](../v23.2/architecture/distribution-layer.html#range-merges). [#119541][#119541]
- Fixed a bug where running a [changefeed]({% link v23.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) that targets a table with a user-defined type column and with the [`envelope` option]({% link v23.2/create-changefeed.md %}#envelope) set to any value other than `wrapped` would cause a node panic due to a nil dereference. [#119738][#119738]
- Fixed a rare panic that could happen during a `pg_dump` import that contains a function that has a subquery in one of its arguments, like `SELECT addgeometrycolumn(...)`. Now, attempting to import a `pg_dump` with such a function results in an expected error. [#118612][#118612]
- Users with the [VIEWACTIVITY](../v23.2/security-reference/authorization.html#supported-privileges) privilege can now request statement bundles using `crdb_internal.request_statement_bundle` or through the DB Console [SQL Activity](../v23.2/security-reference/authorization.html#supported-privileges) page. [#118809][#118809]
- Fixed a bug in changefeed [webhook sinks](../v23.2/changefeed-sinks.html#webhook-sink) where the HTTP request body may not be initialized on retries, resulting in the error `http: ContentLength=... with Body length 0`. [#119496][#119496]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors when executing an [`EXPORT`](../v23.2/export.html) statement. [#119711][#119711]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to schema changes with a large number of descriptors doing full table scans on `system.leases`. [#119464][#119464]
- Fixed a bug where rangefeed resolved timestamps could get stuck, continually emitting the log message `pushing old intents failed: range barrier failed, range split`, typically following a range merge. This bug was introduced in v23.2.1. [#119702][#119702]
- Fixed a bug that occurred when using [`ALTER TABLE`](../v23.2/alter-table.html) to drop and re-add a [`CHECK`](../v23.2/check.html) constraint with the same name. [#120076][#120076]
- Fixed a bug that caused a slow memory leak that can accumulate when opening many new connections. The bug was present in v22.2.9+ and v23.1+ versions. [#120245][#120245]
