<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- COPY commands now use "background" quality-of-service level making it subject to admission control (previously, it used the same level as other commands, determined by `default_transaction_quality_of_service` which is "regular" by default, which is not subject to admission control). It can be changed via newly added `copy_transaction_quality_of_service` session variable. [#114535][#114535]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The overview page now correctly renders the background color for the email signup, fixing an issue where it was difficult to read the text. [#114547][#114547]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- An empty range corresponding to a drop table did not respect system level span configurations such as protected timestamps, potentially causing reads above the protected timestamp to fail [#114833][#114833]
- GetFiles should not cause a nil pointer dereference. [#114830][#114830]
