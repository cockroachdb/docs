<h3 id="v23-2-11-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Internally issued queries that are not initiated within a [SQL session]({% link v23.2/show-sessions.md %}) no longer respect a [statement timeout]({% link v23.2/session-variables.md %}#statement-timeout). This includes: background [jobs]({% link v23.2/show-jobs.md %}), queries issued by the [DB Console]({% link v23.2/ui-overview.md %}) that perform introspection, and the [Cloud SQL shell]({% link cockroachcloud/sql-shell.md %}). [#130525][#130525]
- Fixed a rare bug where a [lease transfer]({% link v23.2/architecture/replication-layer.md %}#leases) could lead to a `side-transport update saw closed timestamp regression` panic. The bug could occur when a node was [overloaded]({% link v23.2/ui-overload-dashboard.md %}) and failing to heartbeat its [node liveness]({% link v23.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.md %}#node-liveness-issues) record. [#130523][#130523]
- Resolved a concerning [log]({% link v23.2/logging-overview.md %}) message: `expiration of liveness record ... is not greater than expiration of the previous lease ... after liveness heartbeat`. This message is no longer possible. [#130523][#130523]
