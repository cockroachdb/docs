<h3 id="v23-2-11-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Internally issued queries that are not initiated within a SQL session no longer respect a statement timeout. This includes: background jobs, queries issued by the db console that perform introspection, and the cloud sql shell. [#130525][#130525]
- Fixed a rare bug where a lease transfer could lead to a `side-transport update saw closed timestamp regression` panic. The bug could occur when a node was overloaded and failing to heartbeat its node liveness record. [#130523][#130523]
- Resolves a concerning log message that says "expiration of liveness record ... is not greater than expiration of the previous lease ... after liveness heartbeat". This message is no longer possible. [#130523][#130523]
