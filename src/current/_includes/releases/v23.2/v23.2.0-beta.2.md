## v23.2.0-beta.2

Release Date: December 5, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now periodically dumps the state of its internal memory accounting system into the `heap_profiler/` directory when a heap profile is taken. To disable this behavior, set the `diagnostics.memory_monitoring_dumps.enabled` [cluster setting](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) to `false`. [#114998][#114998]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise Edition changes</h3>

- When using [Physical Cluster Replication](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview), you can now [initiate a cutover](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cutover-replication) as of `LATEST` before the initial scan completes. [#115101][#115101]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- In the [Changeeds dashboard](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-cdc-dashboard), the **Max Checkpoint Latency** chart title now refers to "Lag" rather than "Latency", to better reflect the intention of the underlying metric, which measures how recently the changefeed was last checkpointed. [#115003][#115003]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented the **SQL Activity** page from showing internal statements when the `sql.stats.response.show_internal.enabled` [cluster setting](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) was set to `true`. [#114824][#114824]
- Fixed a bug where an active replication report update could get stuck in a retry loop on clusters with over 10000 ranges. This could prevent a node from shutting down cleanly. [#114178][#114178]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that could cause an internal error when using the text format (as opposed to binary) when [preparing a statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/sql-grammar#prepare_stmt) with a user-defined composite type. [#115064][#115064]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a replica to be stuck processing in a queue's replica set when the replica had recently been removed from purgatory for processing but was destroyed, or the replica's ID changed before being processed. These replicas are now removed from the queue when they are encountered. [#115037][#115037]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a [prepared statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/sql-grammar#prepare_stmt) to fail if it references both an `enum` and a table that has undergone a schema change. [#115132][#115132]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Query planning time has been reduced significantly for some queries in which many tables are joined. [#114445][#114445]
