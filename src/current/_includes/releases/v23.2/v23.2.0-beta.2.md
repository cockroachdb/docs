Release Date: December 5, 2023

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now periodically dumps the state of its internal memory accounting system into the `heap_profiler/` directory when a heap profile is taken. To disable this behavior, set the `diagnostics.memory_monitoring_dumps.enabled` [cluster setting](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) to `false`. [#114998][#114998]
- [#115604][#115604] [d4d8f15d7][d4d8f15d7] release-23.2: Revert "s3: disable content pre-upload checksums" (Aditya Maru <adityamaru@gmail.com>)
- [#115481][#115481] [69b51a5cd][69b51a5cd] release-23.2: storage: disable multi-level compactions (Nick Travers <travers@cockroachlabs.com>)

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise Edition changes</h3>

- When using [Physical Cluster Replication](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview), you can now [initiate a cutover](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cutover-replication) as of `LATEST` before the initial scan completes. [#115101][#115101]
- SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB,  SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS, and SHOW JOBS no longer expose user sensitive infromation(`api_secret`, `sasl_password`, `client_cert`, and `ca_cert`) in the job description and sinkURI output column would reveal sensitive user information (api_secret, sasl_password, client_cert, ca_cert). [#115567][#115567]


<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- In the [Changeeds dashboard](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/ui-cdc-dashboard), the **Max Checkpoint Latency** chart title now refers to "Lag" rather than "Latency", to better reflect the intention of the underlying metric, which measures how recently the changefeed was last checkpointed. [#115003][#115003]
- Time on X-Axis of bar charts on Statement details page display correctly formatted time in UTC. [#115220][#115220]
- This patch remotes the `physical_replication.frontier_lag_nanos` metric and dbconsole graph is it's sometimes wrong. This patch adds `physical_replication.replicated_time_seconds` metric which users may use for alerting. [#115234][#115234]
- Proper handling of "Now" button on Time range selector when custom time period was selected before. [#115514][#115514]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented the **SQL Activity** page from showing internal statements when the `sql.stats.response.show_internal.enabled` [cluster setting](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/cluster-settings) was set to `true`. [#114824][#114824]
- Fixed a bug where an active replication report update could get stuck in a retry loop on clusters with over 10000 ranges. This could prevent a node from shutting down cleanly. [#114178][#114178]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v23.1 that could cause an internal error when using the text format (as opposed to binary) when [preparing a statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/sql-grammar#prepare_stmt) with a user-defined composite type. [#115064][#115064]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a replica to be stuck processing in a queue's replica set when the replica had recently been removed from purgatory for processing but was destroyed, or the replica's ID changed before being processed. These replicas are now removed from the queue when they are encountered. [#115037][#115037]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a [prepared statement](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/sql-grammar#prepare_stmt) to fail if it references both an `enum` and a table that has undergone a schema change. [#115132][#115132]
- Addressed a bug that could cause cluster version finalization to get starved out by descriptor lease renewals on larger clusters. [#115034][#115034]
- Backups now evenly distribute work their work across all replicas, including followers, regardless of leaseholder placement. Epic: none. [#115019][#115019]
- Fixed a bug present only in the 23.2.0-beta.1 version that caused incorrect handling for a single composite-typed variable as the target of a PLpgSQL `INTO` clause. [#115404][#115404]
- Fixes a bug where replicating from a source cluster that is on an older version (<23.2) than the destination cluster would fail because of an undefined builtin function [#114257][#114257]
- In the SQL Activity Transaction Details page, users can now view a transaction fingerprint id across  multiple applications. To do so, they can specify the app name in the `appNames` URL search param using a comma separated encoded string  of transaction fingerprint ids. [#115204][#115204]
- BEGIN statement logs now have correct query `Age` fields. Previously, these fields were being recorded incorrectly which would lead to some statements also appearing erroneously in the slow query logs. [#115259][#115259]

<h3 id="v23-2-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Query planning time has been reduced significantly for some queries in which many tables are joined. [#114445][#114445]
