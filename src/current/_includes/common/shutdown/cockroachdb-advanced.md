Most of the guidance in this page is most relevant to manual deployments, although decommissioning and draining work the same way behind the scenes in a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} cluster. CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters have a `server.shutdown.connections.timeout` of 1800 seconds (30 minutes) and a termination grace period that is slightly longer. The termination grace period is not configurable, and adjusting `server.shutdown.connections.timeout` is generally not recommended.

Client applications or application servers that connect to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters should use connection pools that have a maximum lifetime that is shorter than the [`server.shutdown.connections.timeout`](#server-shutdown-connections-timeout) setting.
