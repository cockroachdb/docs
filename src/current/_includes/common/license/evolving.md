CockroachDB is evolving. In late 2024, we will retire our Core offering to consolidate on a single CockroachDB Enterprise offering under a new [license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/cockroachdb-software-license/). CockroachDB Enterprise will be available at no charge for individual users and small businesses and will offer all users, free and paid, the full breadth of CockroachDB capabilities. See the [CockroachDB licensing update page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/enterprise-license-update/) for details.
