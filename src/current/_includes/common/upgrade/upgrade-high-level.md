When you initiate a major-version upgrade, CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} performs the following high-level steps, which are described in detail in the following sections.

A major-version upgrade involves the following high-level steps, which are described in detail in the following sections.
{% endif %}

1. On one node at a time:
    1. Replace the previous `cockroach` binary or container image with the new binary.
    1. Restart the `cockroach` process and verify that the node has rejoined the cluster.
1. When all nodes have rejoined the cluster:
    1. For a patch upgrade within the same major version, the upgrade is complete.
    1. For a major-version upgrade, the upgrade is not complete until it is [finalized](#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually). Auto-finalization is enabled by default, and begins as soon as all nodes have rejoined the cluster using the new binary. If you need the ability to [roll back a major-version upgrade](#roll-back-a-major-version-upgrade), you can disable auto-finalization and finalize the upgrade manually. Certain features and performance improvements, such as those that require changes to system schemas or objects, are not available until the upgrade is finalized.
