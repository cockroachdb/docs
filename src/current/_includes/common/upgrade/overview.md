### Types of upgrades

- **Major-version upgrades**: A [major-version upgrade]({% link releases/index.md %}#major-releases), such as from v24.2 to v24.3, may include new features, updates to cluster setting defaults, and backward-incompatible changes. Performing a major-version upgrade requires an additional step to finalize the upgrade.

{% if page.path contains "cockroachcloud" %}
    As of 2024, there are four major versions per year, where every second release is an [innovation release]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}#innovation-releases). For CockroachDB CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }}, innovation releases include all of the latest features but have shorter [support windows]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}#cockroachdb-cloud-support-policy) and can be skipped.
    
    For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.basic }}, only Regular releases are supported. Major version upgrades are applied automatically to {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters as they become available, and {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters have the option to turn off automatic updates.
{% else %}
    As of 2024, every second major version is an [Innovation release]({% link releases/release-support-policy.md %}#innovation-releases). Innovation releases offer shorter support windows and can be skipped.
{% endif %}
- **Patch upgrades**: A [patch upgrade]({% link releases/index.md %}#patch-releases) moves a cluster from one patch release to another within a major version, such as from v24.2.3 to v24.2.4. Patch upgrades do not introduce backward-incompatible changes.

    A major version of CockroachDB has two phases of patch releases: a series of **testing releases** (beta, alpha, and RC releases) followed by a series of **production releases** (vX.Y.0, vX.Y.1, and so on). A major versionâ€™s first production release (the .0 release) is also known as its GA release.

{% if page.path contains "cockroachcloud" %}
    For all CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters, production patch releases for a major version are automatically applied until the cluster is upgraded to a new major version.
{% endif %}

To learn more about CockroachDB major versions and patches, refer to the [Releases Overview]({% link releases/index.md %}#overview).

### Upgrade differences across Cloud plans

CockroachDB Cloud plan | Major version upgrades | Innovation releases
---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------
Basic | Automatic | Unavailable
Standard | Automatic (default) or customer-initiated | Unavailable
Advanced | Customer-initiated | Optional

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters that are set to upgrade automatically, major version upgrades are finalized immediately and cannot be rolled back. {{ site.data.products.basic }} and {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters are upgraded to the .1 patch release of a major version, not the initial .0 release.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

For all Cloud plans:

- All major versions that are Regular releases (as opposed to Innovation releases) are required upgrades before proceeding to a newer major version. To maintain support, an upgrade to a supported version must occur prior to the [EOS date]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}) of the current version.
- Patch version upgrades occur automatically.
{% endif %}
### Compatible versions

A cluster may always be upgraded to the next major {% if page.path contains "cockroachcloud" %}Regular release once it is made available in CockroachDB Cloud{% else %}release{% endif %}. Every second major version is an Innovation release that can be deployed or skipped{% if page.path contains "cockroachcloud" %} on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters{% endif %}:

- If your cluster is running a major version that is a Regular release, it can be upgraded to either:
  - the next major version (an Innovation release)
  - the release that follows the next major version (the next Regular release, once it is available, skipping the Innovation release).

- If a cluster is running a major version that is labeled an Innovation release, it can be upgraded only to the next Regular release.
