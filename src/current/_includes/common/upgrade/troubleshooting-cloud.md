After the upgrade has finalized (whether manually or automatically), it is no longer possible to roll back the upgrade. If you are experiencing problems, we recommend that you [open a support request]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/support-resources.md %}) for assistance.

In the event of catastrophic failure or corruption, it may be necessary to [restore]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}) from a backup to a new cluster running the previous major version.
