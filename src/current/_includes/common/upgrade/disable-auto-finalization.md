Previously, to disable automatic finalization and preserve the ability to roll back a major-version upgrade, it was required to set the cluster setting `cluster.preserve_downgrade_option` to the cluster's current major version before beginning the major-version upgrade, and then to unset the setting to finalize the upgrade.

We now recommend managing a cluster's finalization policy using the cluster setting `cluster.auto_upgrade.enabled`, which was introduced in v23.2. The setting does not need to be modified after it is initially set.

Either of these settings prevents automatic finalization.

For clusters managed by the Operator, auto-finalization is disabled and cannot be enabled. A major version upgrade is not complete until it is manually [finalized](#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually). The Operator does not yet support the [cluster setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cluster-settings.md %}) `cluster.auto_upgrade.enabled`.

By default, auto-finalization is enabled, and a major-version upgrade is finalized when all nodes have rejoined the cluster using the new `cockroach` binary. This means that by default, a major-version upgrade cannot be rolled back. Instead, you must [restore the cluster to the previous version]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/restoring-backups-across-versions.md %}#support-for-restoring-backups-into-a-newer-version).

To disable auto-finalization:

1. Connect to the cluster using the SQL shell:

    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure \
    -- ./cockroach sql \
    --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs \
    --host=cockroachdb-public
    ~~~

1. Set the [cluster setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cluster-settings.md %}) `cluster.auto_upgrade.enabled` to `false`.

Now, to complete a major-version upgrade, you must manually [finalize it](#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually) or [roll it back](#roll-back-a-major-version-upgrade).
