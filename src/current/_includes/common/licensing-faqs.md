## Set a license

{% include common/set-enterprise-license.md %}

## Verify a license

To verify a license, open the [built-in SQL shell]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}) and use the [`SHOW CLUSTER SETTING`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-cluster-setting.md %}) command to check the organization name and license key:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  SHOW CLUSTER SETTING cluster.organization;
~~~
~~~
  cluster.organization
+----------------------+
  Acme Company
(1 row)
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  SHOW CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license;
~~~
~~~
             enterprise.license
+-------------------------------------------+
  crl-0-ChB1x...
(1 row)
~~~

The license setting is also logged in the cockroach.log on the node where the command is run:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
$ cat cockroach.log | grep license
~~~
~~~
I171116 18:11:48.279604 1514 sql/event_log.go:102  [client=[::1]:56357,user=root,n1] Event: "set_cluster_setting", target: 0, info: {SettingName:enterprise.license Value:xxxxxxxxxxxx User:root}
~~~

## Monitor for license expiry

You can monitor the time until your license expires in the following ways:

1. [Prometheus]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.md %}): The `seconds_until_enterprise_license_expiry` metric reports the number of seconds until the license on a cluster expires. It will report `0` if there is no license, and a negative number if the license has already expired. For more information, see [Monitoring and Alerting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitoring-and-alerting.md %}).
1. [DB console]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}): Several [license expiration messages]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}#license-expiration-message) may be displayed, depending on the status of your cluster's license.

## Renew an expired license

To renew an expired **Enterprise** license, <a href="mailto:sales@cockroachlabs.com">contact Sales</a> and then [set](#set-a-license) the new license.

To renew an expired **Enterprise Free** license, follow the steps in [Obtain a license](#obtain-a-license).

## FAQs

### Can I host CockroachDB as a service for internal use at my organization?

Yes, employees and contractors can use your internal CockroachDB instance as a service, but no people outside of your organization will be able to use it without purchasing a license. Use of Enterprise features will always require a license.

### What constitutes hosting CockroachDB as a service?

Hosting CockroachDB as a service means creating an offering that allows third parties (other than your employees and contractors) to operate a database. Specifically, third parties cannot modify table schemas.

<a name="throttling"></a>

### What is throttling and how does it work?

When a cluster is being throttled, the number of concurrent open [SQL transactions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}) limited to 5.

This will only happen in the following cases:

- The cluster has no [valid license key](#obtain-a-license).
- The cluster is not following telemetry requirements.

There is a 7 day grace period for new **Enterprise Free** clusters to start sending telemetry.

Single node clusters for development use are [not throttled](#single-node-clusters).

### Can I use CockroachDB for academic research?

Cockroach Labs encourages non-commercial academic research involving CockroachDB. For such projects, please [contact us][support] to discuss a possible licensing arrangement.

<a name="single-node-clusters"></a>

### Do I need a license key for running a single node cluster?

No license key is required for developers running [single-node clusters]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start-single-node.md %}) using the following [`cockroach` commands]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-commands.md %}):

- [`cockroach start-single-node`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start-single-node.md %})
- [`cockroach demo`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-demo.md %})

Single node clusters are not [throttled](#throttling).
