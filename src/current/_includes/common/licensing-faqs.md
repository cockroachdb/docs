## Obtain a license

To obtain a paid **Enterprise** license, <a href="mailto:sales@cockroachlabs.com">contact Sales</a>.

To obtain an **Enterprise Free** or **Enterprise Trial** license, take the following steps:

1. Point your web browser to the [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console][cloud-console] and [log in]({% link cockroachcloud/authentication.md %}#console-ui-authentication) as an account with **Organization Admin** permissions.
1. Select **Organization &raquo; Enterprise Licenses** from the nav bar dropdown. This will bring you to the **Enterprise Licenses** page, which shows a (possibly empty) list of licenses and their keys, with information about the status of each.
1. Click the **Create License** button. This will bring you to a page called **Get started with CockroachDB Enterprise**.
1. On this page, you will create an **Enterprise Trial** license or an **Enterprise Free** license.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
You will not be able to create more than one **Enterprise Trial** license per day. If you try, the UI will prevent you from proceeding, and the following message will be displayed:

_A new Enterprise Trial license cannot be created at this time because one was recently created. Tell us more about your intended use to find out if you qualify for an Enterprise Free license, or create a new one after ${DATE}._
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
For quick local testing of Enterprise features, you can [run a single-node cluster](#single-node-clusters).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Set a license

{% include common/set-enterprise-license.md %}

## Verify a license

To verify a license, open the [built-in SQL shell]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}) and use the [`SHOW CLUSTER SETTING`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-cluster-setting.md %}) command to check the license key:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SHOW CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license;
~~~
~~~
             enterprise.license
+-------------------------------------------+
  crl-0-ChB1x...
(1 row)
~~~

The license setting is also logged in the `cockroach.log` on the node where the command is run:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
cat cockroach.log | grep license
~~~
~~~
I171116 18:11:48.279604 1514 sql/event_log.go:102  [client=[::1]:56357,user=root,n1] Event: "set_cluster_setting", target: 0, info: {SettingName:enterprise.license Value:xxxxxxxxxxxx User:root}
~~~

## Monitor for license expiry

You can monitor the time until your license expires in the following ways:

1. [Prometheus]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.md %}): The `seconds_until_enterprise_license_expiry` metric reports the number of seconds until the license on a cluster expires. It will report `0` if there is no license, and a negative number if the license has already expired. For more information, see [Monitoring and Alerting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitoring-and-alerting.md %}).
1. [DB Console]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}): Several [license expiration messages]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}#license-expiration-message) may be displayed, depending on the status of your cluster's license.
1. [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console][cloud-console]: If you have an **Enterprise Free** or **Enterprise Trial** cluster, you will see notifications in the **Enterprise Licenses** section, as well as receive notification emails sent to users with **Organization Admin** permissions.
1. CockroachDB emits [log messages]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/logging-overview.md %}) when a cluster is at risk of being [throttled](#throttling) due to license expiration or [telemetry]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/telemetry.md %}) requirements. The database will also return notices to [SQL clients]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}) or [applications]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/install-client-drivers.md %}) that try to execute [transactions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
During the transition to the [CockroachDB Software License][csl], expiration behavior (including [throttling](#throttling)) will work as follows depending on your version of CockroachDB.

For v23.1.29, v23.2.15, v24.1.7, v24.2.5, and v24.3.0 and later, clusters will behave as described in this documentation.

For versions less than or equal to v23.1.28, v23.2.14, v24.1.6, and v24.2.4, the behavior will be as follows:

- **Enterprise Trial** and **Enterprise Free** licenses will work as expected when you [set a license](#set-a-license).
- However, the expiration behavior will be different. Clusters running these versions won't be [throttled](#throttling); instead, the Enterprise features will immediately stop working at license expiration.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Renew an expired license

To renew an expired **Enterprise** license, <a href="mailto:sales@cockroachlabs.com">contact Sales</a> and then [set](#set-a-license) the new license.

To renew an expired **Enterprise Free** license, follow the steps in [Obtain a license](#obtain-a-license).

## FAQs

### Can I host CockroachDB as a service for internal use at my organization?

Yes, employees and contractors can use your internal CockroachDB instance as a service, but no people outside of your organization will be able to use it without purchasing a license.

### What constitutes hosting CockroachDB as a service?

Hosting CockroachDB as a service means creating an offering that allows third parties (other than your employees and contractors) to operate a database. Specifically, third parties cannot modify table schemas.

<a name="throttling"></a>

### What is throttling and how does it work?

When a cluster is being throttled, the number of concurrent open [SQL transactions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}) is limited to 5.

This will happen in the following cases:

- The cluster is not following [telemetry]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/telemetry.md %}) requirements.
    - There is a 7 day grace period for **Enterprise Free** and **Enterprise Trial** clusters to (re)start sending telemetry. This applies when the license is first [added](#set-a-license), or any time there is an interruption in telemetry.
- The cluster has an expired [license key](#obtain-a-license); depending on the type of expired license, the cluster will be throttled after the following time periods:
    - **Enterprise**: Never throttles
    - **Enterprise Free**: Throttles 30 days after expiration
    - **Enterprise Trial**: Throttles 7 days after expiration
- The cluster was running an earlier version of CockroachDB which supported the license known as "CockroachDB Core" and has just been patch upgraded to a version of CockroachDB which is available under the [CockroachDB Software License][csl]. Such clusters get a 30 day grace period before being throttled to de-risk impact to production environments.

If no valid license key is ever entered, the cluster will be throttled 7 days after cluster initialization.

Single-node clusters for development use are [not throttled](#single-node-clusters).

### Can I use CockroachDB for academic research?

Cockroach Labs encourages non-commercial academic research involving CockroachDB. For such projects, [obtain an **Enterprise Free** license](#obtain-a-license).

<a name="single-node-clusters"></a>

### Do I need a license key for running a single node cluster?

No license key is required for developers running [single-node clusters]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start-single-node.md %}) using the following [`cockroach` commands]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-commands.md %}):

- [`cockroach start-single-node`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start-single-node.md %})
- [`cockroach demo`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-demo.md %})

Single-node clusters are not [throttled](#throttling).

Generally, single-node clusters used for design, prototyping, testing, or development purposes in non-production, internal development environments do not require a license key.
