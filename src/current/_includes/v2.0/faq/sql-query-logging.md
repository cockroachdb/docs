There are several ways to log SQL queries. The type of logging you use will depend on your requirements.

- For per-table audit logs, turn on [SQL audit logs](#sql-audit-logs).
- For system troubleshooting and performance optimization, turn on [cluster-wide execution logs](#cluster-wide-execution-logs).
- For local testing, turn on [per-node execution logs](#per-node-execution-logs).

### SQL audit logs

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/experimental-warning.md %}

SQL audit logging is useful if you want to log all queries that are run against specific tables.

- For a tutorial, see [SQL Audit Logging](sql-audit-logging.html).

- For SQL reference documentation, see [`ALTER TABLE ... EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT`](experimental-audit.html).

### Cluster-wide execution logs

For production clusters, the best way to log all queries is to turn on the [cluster-wide setting](cluster-settings.html) `sql.trace.log_statement_execute`:

~~~ sql
> SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.trace.log_statement_execute = true;
~~~

With this setting on, each node of the cluster writes all SQL queries it executes to its log file. When you no longer need to log queries, you can turn the setting back off:

~~~ sql
> SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.trace.log_statement_execute = false;
~~~

### Per-node execution logs

Alternatively, if you are testing CockroachDB locally and want to log queries executed just by a specific node, you can either pass a CLI flag at node startup, or execute a SQL function on a running node.

Using the CLI to start a new node, pass the `--vmodule` flag to the [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) command. For example, to start a single node locally and log all SQL queries it executes, you'd run:

~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --insecure --host=localhost --vmodule=exec_log=2
~~~

From the SQL prompt on a running node, execute the `crdb_internal.set_vmodule()` [function](functions-and-operators.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT crdb_internal.set_vmodule('exec_log=2');
~~~

This will result in the following output:

~~~
+---------------------------+
| crdb_internal.set_vmodule |
+---------------------------+
|                         0 |
+---------------------------+
(1 row)
~~~

Once the logging is enabled, all of the node's queries will be written to the [CockroachDB log file](debug-and-error-logs.html) as follows:

~~~
I180402 19:12:28.112957 394661 sql/exec_log.go:173  [n1,client=127.0.0.1:50155,user=root] exec "psql" {} "SELECT version()" {} 0.795 1 ""
~~~
