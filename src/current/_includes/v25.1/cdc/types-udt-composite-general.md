Changefeed types are not fully integrated with [user-defined composite types]({{ page.version.version }}/create-type.md). Running changefeeds with user-defined composite types is in [Preview]({{ page.version.version }}/cockroachdb-feature-availability.md#feature-availability-phases). Certain changefeed types do not support user-defined composite types. Refer to the change data capture [Known Limitations]({{ page.version.version }}/create-and-configure-changefeeds.md#known-limitations) for more detail.
