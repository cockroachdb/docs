[Per-replica circuit breakers]({{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md#per-replica-circuit-breakers) have the following limitations:

- They cannot prevent requests from hanging when the node's [liveness range]({{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md#epoch-based-leases-table-data) is unavailable. For more information about troubleshooting a cluster that's having node liveness issues, see [Node liveness issues]({{ page.version.version }}/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.md#node-liveness-issues).
- They are not tripped if _all_ replicas of a range [become unavailable]({{ page.version.version }}/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.md#db-console-shows-under-replicated-unavailable-ranges), because the circuit breaker mechanism operates per-replica. This means at least one replica needs to be available to receive the request in order for the breaker to trip.
