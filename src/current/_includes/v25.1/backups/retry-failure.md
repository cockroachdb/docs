If a backup job encounters too many retryable errors, it will enter a [`failed` state]({{ page.version.version }}/show-jobs.md#job-status) with the most recent error, which allows subsequent backups the chance to succeed. Refer to the [Backup and Restore Monitoring]({{ page.version.version }}/backup-and-restore-monitoring.md) page for metrics to track backup failures.
