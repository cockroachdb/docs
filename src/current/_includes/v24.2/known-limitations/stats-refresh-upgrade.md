The [automatic statistics refresher]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#control-statistics-refresh-rate) automatically checks whether it needs to refresh statistics for every table in the database upon startup of each node in the cluster. If statistics for a table have not been refreshed in a while, this will trigger collection of statistics for that table. If statistics have been refreshed recently, it will not force a refresh. As a result, the automatic statistics refresher does not necessarily perform a refresh of statistics after an [upgrade]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}). This could cause a problem, for example, if the upgrade moves from a version without [histograms]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#control-histogram-collection) to a version with histograms. To refresh statistics manually, use [`CREATE STATISTICS`](create-statistics.html). [#54816](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/54816)
