- Because [generic query plans]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#query-plan-cache) use lookup joins instead of the scans and revscans used by custom query plans, generic query plans do not perform as well as custom query plans in some cases. [#128916](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/128916)
- [Generic query plans]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#query-plan-type) are not included in the [plan cache]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cost-based-optimizer.md %}#query-plan-cache). This means a generic query plan built and optimized for a prepared statement in one session cannot be used by another session. To reuse generic query plans for maximum performance, a prepared statement should be executed multiple times instead of prepared and executed once.
