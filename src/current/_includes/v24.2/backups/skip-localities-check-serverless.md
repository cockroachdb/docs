Restoring a multi-region cluster into a single-region CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster is not supported. It is not possible to use the `skip-localities-check` option with `RESTORE`, because a {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster does not allow you to manually reconcile any restored regions that the cluster cannot meet. To restore a multi-region cluster, you must [create a new multi-region]({% link cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management.md %}#move-cluster-to-a-new-region) {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster with the desired regions that match the backup.
