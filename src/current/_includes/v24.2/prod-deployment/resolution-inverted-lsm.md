If compaction has fallen behind and caused an [inverted LSM]({{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md#inverted-lsms), throttle your workload concurrency to allow [compaction]({{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md#compaction) to catch up and restore a healthy LSM shape. {% include "_includes/25.1/prod-deployment/prod-guidance-connection-pooling.md" %} If a node is severely impacted, you can [start a new node]({{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start.md) and then [decommission the problematic node](node-shutdown.html?filters=decommission#remove-nodes). {% include "_includes/25.1/storage/compaction-concurrency.md" %}
