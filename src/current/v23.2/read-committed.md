{% include_cached new-in.html version="v23.2" %} `READ COMMITTED` is one of two [transaction isolation levels](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)) supported on CockroachDB. By default, CockroachDB uses the [`SERIALIZABLE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-serializable.md %}) isolation level, which is the strongest [ANSI transaction isolation level](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Isolation_levels).

`READ COMMITTED` isolation is appropriate in the following scenarios:

- Your application needs to maintain a high workload concurrency with minimal [transaction retries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/developer-basics.md %}#transaction-retries), and it can tolerate potential [concurrency anomalies](#concurrency-anomalies). Predictable query performance at high concurrency is more valuable than guaranteed transaction [serializability]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/developer-basics.md %}#serializability-and-transaction-contention).

- You are [migrating an application to CockroachDB]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/migration-overview.md %}) that was built at a `READ COMMITTED` isolation level on the source database, and it is not feasible to modify your application to use `SERIALIZABLE` isolation.

Whereas `SERIALIZABLE` isolation guarantees data correctness by placing transactions into a [serializable ordering]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-serializable.md %}), `READ COMMITTED` isolation permits some [concurrency anomalies](#concurrency-anomalies) in exchange for minimizing transaction aborts, [retries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/developer-basics.md %}#transaction-retries), and blocking. Unlike `SERIALIZABLE` transactions, `READ COMMITTED` transactions do not usually return any [serialization errors]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}) that require client-side handling. See [`READ COMMITTED` transaction behavior](#read-committed-transaction-behavior).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`READ COMMITTED` on CockroachDB provides stronger isolation than `READ COMMITTED` on PostgreSQL. On CockroachDB, `READ COMMITTED` prevents anomalies within single statements. For complete details on how `READ COMMITTED` is implemented on CockroachDB, see the [Read Committed RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20230122_read_committed_isolation.md).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Enable `READ COMMITTED` isolation

To make `READ COMMITTED` isolation available to use on a cluster, enable the following [cluster setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cluster-settings.md %}) in the SQL shell:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled = 'true';
~~~

After you enable the cluster setting, you can configure `READ COMMITTED` isolation at the [session](#set-the-current-session-to-read-committed) or [transaction](#set-the-current-transaction-to-read-committed) level.

### Set the current session to `READ COMMITTED`

To set all future transactions in a session to run at `READ COMMITTED` isolation, use one of the following options, which can be set per database or [per role]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/alter-role.md %}#set-default-session-variable-values-for-a-role):

- The [`SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-vars.md %}#special-syntax-cases) statement:

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
	~~~

- The `default_transaction_isolation` [session variable]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/session-variables.md %}):

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	SET default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed';
	~~~

- The `default_transaction_isolation` session variable as a [connection parameter]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/connection-parameters.md %}#connect-using-a-url) with [`cockroach sql`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}):

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	cockroach sql -â€“url='postgresql://{username}@{host}:{port}/{database}?options=-c default_transaction_isolation=read%20committed'
	~~~

To view the isolation level of a session:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SHOW default_transaction_isolation;
~~~

~~~
	default_transaction_isolation
-----------------------------------------------------
	read committed
~~~

### Set the current transaction to `READ COMMITTED`

To begin a transaction as a `READ COMMITTED` transaction, use one of the following options:

- The [`BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/begin-transaction.md %}#parameters) statement:

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
	~~~

- The [`SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-transaction.md %}#parameters) statement, at the beginning of the transaction:

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	BEGIN;
	  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
	~~~

- The `transaction_isolation` [session variable]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/session-variables.md %}), at the beginning of the transaction: 

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	BEGIN;
	  SET transaction_isolation = 'read committed';
	~~~

To view the isolation level of a transaction, run `SHOW` within the open transaction:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SHOW transaction_isolation;
~~~

~~~
  transaction_isolation
-------------------------
  read committed
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Starting a transaction as `READ COMMITTED` does not affect the [session-level isolation setting](#set-the-current-session-to-read-committed), which can be different.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## `READ COMMITTED` transaction behavior

`READ COMMITTED` and `SERIALIZABLE` transactions both serve globally consistent ("non-stale") reads and [commit atomically]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/developer-basics.md %}#how-transactions-work-in-cockroachdb). `READ COMMITTED` transactions have the following differences:

- Writes in concurrent `READ COMMITTED` transactions can interleave without blocking or aborting transactions, and a write can never block a read of the same row. This is because `READ COMMITTED` transactions are not required to be placed into a [serializable ordering]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-serializable.md %}). 

- Whereas statements in `SERIALIZABLE` transactions see data that committed before the transaction began, statements in `READ COMMITTED` transactions see data that committed before each **statement** began. If rows are being updated by concurrent writes, reads in a `READ COMMITTED` transaction can return different results.

	{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
	For details on how this is implemented, see [Read snapshots]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#read-snapshots).
	{{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Due to the preceding behaviors, `READ COMMITTED` transactions permit some types of concurrency anomalies that are prevented in `SERIALIZABLE` transactions. For details and examples, see [Concurrency anomalies](#concurrency-anomalies).

- You can mitigate concurrency anomalies by issuing [locking reads](#locking-reads) in `READ COMMITTED` transactions. These statements can block concurrent transactions that are issuing writes or other locking reads on the same rows.

- When using `READ COMMITTED` isolation, you do not need to implement [client-side retries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}#client-side-retry-handling) to handle `40001` errors. This is because under [transaction contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention), `READ COMMITTED` transactions will **not** return [serialization errors]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}) to applications.

`READ COMMITTED` transactions can abort in the following scenarios:

- Transactions at all isolation levels are subject to [*lock contention*]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention), where a transaction attempts to lock a row that is already locked by a [write]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#write-intents) or [locking read](#locking-reads). In such cases, the later transaction is blocked until the earlier transaction commits or rolls back, thus releasing its lock on the row. Locking contention that produces a *deadlock* between two transactions will result in a transaction abort and a `40001` error ([`ABORT_REASON_ABORTED_RECORD_FOUND`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}#abort_reason_aborted_record_found) or [`ABORT_REASON_PUSHER_ABORTED`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}#abort_reason_pusher_aborted)) returned to the client. For an example, see [Reserve row values using shared locks](#reserve-row-values-using-shared-locks).

- [Constraint]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/constraints.md %}) violations will abort transactions at all isolation levels.

- In rare cases under `READ COMMITTED` isolation, a [`RETRY_WRITE_TOO_OLD`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}#retry_write_too_old) or [`ReadWithinUncertaintyIntervalError`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}#readwithinuncertaintyintervalerror) error will be returned to the client if a statement has already begun streaming a partial result set back to the client and cannot retry transparently. By default, the result set is buffered up to 16 KiB before overflowing and being streamed to the client. You can configure the result buffer size using the [`sql.defaults.results_buffer.size`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-sql-defaults-results-buffer-size) cluster setting or the [`results_buffer_size`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/session-variables.md %}) session variable.

### Concurrency anomalies

Statements in concurrent `READ COMMITTED` transactions can interleave with each other. This can create concurrency anomalies that are not permitted under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation, which places concurrent transactions into a [serializable ordering]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-serializable.md %}).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The behaviors described in this section assume the use of non-locking reads. You can prevent concurrency anomalies through the selective use of [locking reads](#locking-reads), which can also increase latency due to [lock contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Write skew anomaly

The following sequence of operations is possible under `READ COMMITTED` isolation: 

1. Transaction `A` reads row `R` in table `T` at timestamp `1`.
1. Transaction `B` writes to row `R` in table `T` and commits at timestamp `2`.
1. Transaction `A` writes to another row in table `T` and commits at timestamp `3`.

The value of `R` has changed while transaction `A` is open. However, `A` can still write and commit instead of aborting, since `READ COMMITTED` transactions do not require serializability. This does not inherently create an anomaly, but is the basis of potential *write skew anomalies* where two concurrent transactions each read values that the other subsequently updates.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
For details on why this is allowed, see [Read refreshing]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#write-skew-tolerance).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

##### Example: Write skew anomaly

For an example of how a write skew anomaly can occur, see [Demonstrate interleaved statements in `READ COMMITTED` transactions](#demonstrate-interleaved-statements-in-read-committed-transactions).

#### Lost updates

The `READ COMMITTED` conditions that permit [write skew anomalies](#write-skew-anomaly) also permit *lost updates*, where an update from a transaction appears to be "lost" because it is overwritten by a concurrent transaction:

1. Transaction `A` reads row `R` in table `T` at timestamp `1`.
1. Transaction `B` writes to row `R` in table `T` and commits at timestamp `2`.
1. Transaction `A` writes to row `R` in table `T` and commits at timestamp `3`.

The value of `R` has changed while transaction `A` is open. However, `A` can still write to `R` and commit, effectively overwriting the update from transaction `B`.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Under `SERIALIZABLE` isolation, transaction `A` would have aborted with a [`RETRY_WRITE_TOO_OLD`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transaction-retry-error-reference.md %}#retry_write_too_old) error, prompting the client to retry the transaction.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

##### Example: Lost update

  <div class="grid-container">
  <h5 style="text-align:center">Session 1</h5><h5 style="text-align:center">Session 2</h5>
  <div class="grid-item">
  In a terminal window (Session 1), create a table and insert some values:

  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  CREATE TABLE kv (k INT PRIMARY KEY, v INT);
  ~~~

  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  INSERT INTO kv VALUES (1, 2);
  ~~~
  
  Begin a `READ COMMITTED` transaction and read a table row:

  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
    SELECT * FROM kv WHERE k = 1;
  ~~~
  
  ~~~
    k | v

    1 | 2
  ~~~
  </div>

  <div class="grid-item">
  In a new terminal window (Session 2), begin another `READ COMMITTED` transaction:

  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
  ~~~
  
  Update the table row and commit the transaction:
  
  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  UPDATE kv SET v = 3 WHERE k = 1;
    COMMIT;
  ~~~
  </div>

  <div class="grid-item">
  In Session 1, update the table row again and commit the transaction:

  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  UPDATE kv SET v = 4 WHERE k = 1;
    COMMIT;
  ~~~
  
  Read the table row and see that it reflects the update from Session 1:
  
  {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  ~~~ sql
  SELECT * FROM kv WHERE k = 1;
  ~~~
  
  ~~~
    k | v
  ----+----
    1 | 4
  ~~~
  </div>
  </div>

The update in Session 2 appears to be "lost" because its result is overwritten by a concurrent transaction. It is **not** lost at the database level, and can be found using [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/as-of-system-time.md %}) and a timestamp earlier than the commit in Session 1:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM kv AS OF SYSTEM TIME '2023-11-09 21:22:10' WHERE k = 1;
~~~

~~~
  k | v
----+----
  1 | 3
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
While concurrent `READ COMMITTED` transactions can have their writes overwritten, **uncommitted** writes in `READ COMMITTED` transactions cannot be overwritten.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Non-repeatable reads and phantom reads

`READ COMMITTED` transactions can serve different reads over the course of a transaction.

*Non-repeatable reads* return different row values because a concurrent transaction updated the values in between reads:

1. Transaction `A` reads row `R` in table `T` at timestamp `1`.
1. Transaction `B` writes to row `R` in table `T` and commits at timestamp `2`.
1. Transaction `A` reads row `R` in table `T` and gets a different result at timestamp `3`.

*Phantom reads* return different rows because a concurrent transaction changed the set of rows that satisfy the row search:

1. Transaction `A` reads the set of rows `S` in table `T` at timestamp `1`.
1. Transaction `B` inserts, deletes, or updates rows in `S` in table `T` and commits at timestamp `2`.
1. Transaction `A` reads the set of rows `S` in table `T` and gets a different result at timestamp `3`.

Whereas statements in `SERIALIZABLE` transactions see data that committed before the transaction began, statements in `READ COMMITTED` transactions see data that committed before each **statement** began.

  </div>

## Locking reads

To reduce the occurrence of [concurrency anomalies](#concurrency-anomalies) in `READ COMMITTED` isolation, you can strengthen the isolation of individual transactions by using [`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) or [`SELECT ... FOR SHARE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) to issue *locking reads* on specific rows. Locking reads behave similarly to [writes]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#write-intents): they lock qualifying rows to prevent concurrent writes from modifying them until the transaction commits. Conversely, if a locking read finds that a row is exclusively locked by a concurrent transaction, it waits for the other transaction to commit or rollback before proceeding. A locking read in a transaction will always have the latest value of a row when the transaction commits.

The clause used with the `SELECT` statement determines the *lock strength* of a locking read:

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/select-lock-strengths.md %}

### When to use locking reads

Use locking reads in your application if certain `READ COMMITTED` transactions must guarantee data correctness in [high-contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention) scenarios.

Non-locking reads can allow intermediate writes to update rows before `READ COMMITTED` transactions commit, potentially creating [concurrency anomalies](#concurrency-anomalies). Locking reads prevent such anomalies, but increase the amount of lock contention that [may require intervention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-recipes.md %}#waiting-transaction) if latency becomes too high.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Locking reads are not effective for emulating `SERIALIZABLE` transactions, which can avoid locking reads because they always [abort if reads are not current]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#read-refreshing). As a result, `READ COMMITTED` transactions that use locking reads will perform differently than `SERIALIZABLE` transactions at various levels of concurrency.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To use locking reads:

- If you need to read and later update a row within a transaction, use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to acquire an exclusive lock on the row. This guarantees data integrity between the transaction's read and write operations.

- If you need to read the latest value of a row, but not update the row, use `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` to block all concurrent writes on the row without unnecessarily blocking concurrent reads.

## Examples

In this scenario:

- A hospital has an application for doctors to manage their on-call shifts.
- The hospital has a rule that at least one doctor must be on call at any one time.
- Two doctors are on call for a particular shift, and both of them try to request leave for the shift in two concurrent transactions.
- Under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level, the [write skew anomaly](#write-skew-anomaly) anomaly can potentially result in both doctors successfully booking leave and the hospital having no doctors on call for that particular shift. 

The following examples demonstrate how to:

- Observe that `READ COMMITTED` transactions can [serve different reads](#demonstrate-interleaved-statements-in-read-committed-transactions).
- Use exclusive locks to [strengthen isolation for `READ COMMITTED` transactions](#reserve-rows-for-updates-using-exclusive-locks).
- Use shared locks to [reserve values in `READ COMMITTED` transactions](#reserve-row-values-using-shared-locks).

### Before you begin

1. Open the SQL shell using [`cockroach demo`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-demo.md %}).

1. Enable `READ COMMITTED` transactions:

	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~ sql
	SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.txn.read_committed_isolation.enabled = 'true';
	~~~

1. Create the `doctors` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    CREATE TABLE doctors (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT
    );
    ~~~

1. Create the `schedules` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    CREATE TABLE schedules (
      day DATE,
      doctor_id INT REFERENCES doctors (id),
      on_call BOOL,
      PRIMARY KEY (day, doctor_id)
    );
    ~~~

1. Add two doctors to the `doctors` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    INSERT INTO doctors VALUES
      (1, 'Abe'),
      (2, 'Betty');
    ~~~

1. Insert one week's worth of data into the `schedules` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    INSERT INTO schedules VALUES
      ('2023-12-01', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-01', 2, true),
      ('2023-12-02', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-02', 2, true),
      ('2023-12-03', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-03', 2, true),
      ('2023-12-04', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-04', 2, true),
      ('2023-12-05', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-05', 2, true),
      ('2023-12-06', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-06', 2, true),
      ('2023-12-07', 1, true),
      ('2023-12-07', 2, true);
    ~~~

### Demonstrate interleaved statements in `READ COMMITTED` transactions

Before proceeding, reset the [example scenario](#before-you-begin):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
UPDATE schedules SET on_call = true WHERE on_call = false;
~~~

Confirm that at least one doctor is on call each day of the week:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT day, count(*) AS on_call FROM schedules
  WHERE on_call = true
  GROUP BY day
  ORDER BY day;  
~~~

~~~
     day     | on_call
-------------+----------
  2023-12-01 |       2
  2023-12-02 |       2
  2023-12-03 |       2
  2023-12-04 |       2
  2023-12-05 |       2
  2023-12-06 |       2
  2023-12-07 |       2
~~~

  <div class="grid-container">
  <h5 style="text-align:center">Session 1</h5><h5 style="text-align:center">Session 2</h5>
  <div class="grid-item">
Doctor 1, Abe, starts to request leave for `2023-12-05` using the hospital's schedule management application.

  <div class="grid-item">
In Session 1, commit the transaction:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
COMMIT;
~~~

[By design under `READ COMMITTED` isolation]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#write-skew-tolerance), CockroachDB allows the transaction to commit even though its previous read (the `SELECT` query) has changed due to the concurrent transaction in Session 2.

  <div class="grid-item">
In Session 2, read the rows for `2023-12-05` again:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM schedules
  WHERE day = '2023-12-05';
~~~

~~~
     day     | doctor_id | on_call

  2023-12-05 |         2 |    f
~~~

The result has changed because Session 1 committed earlier and updated the `on_call` value for doctor 1, thus changing the read result for the transaction in Session 2.

If the transaction in Session 2 commits and updates the `on_call` value for Betty, this will create a [write skew anomaly](#write-skew-anomaly). The result would be that neither Abe nor Betty is scheduled to be on call on `2023-12-05`.

Instead, the transaction should rollback so that the write skew anomaly does not commit:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
ROLLBACK;
~~~
  </div>

### Reserve rows for updates using exclusive locks

Before proceeding, reset the [example scenario](#before-you-begin):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
UPDATE schedules SET on_call = true WHERE on_call = false;
~~~

Confirm that at least one doctor is on call each day of the week:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SELECT day, count(*) AS on_call FROM schedules
  WHERE on_call = true
  GROUP BY day
  ORDER BY day;

Check to make sure that another doctor is on call for `2023-12-05`. Use [`FOR UPDATE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/select-for-update.md %}) to lock the rows so that only the current transaction can update them:

## Known limitations

The following are not yet supported with `READ COMMITTED`:

- Schema changes cannot be performed within explicit `READ COMMITTED` transactions, and will cause transactions to abort. As a workaround, [set the transaction's isolation level](#set-the-current-transaction-to-read-committed) to `SERIALIZABLE`.
- `READ COMMITTED` isolation cannot be set at the cluster level. As a workaround, run `ALTER ROLE ALL SET default_transaction_isolation = 'read committed'`.
- `READ COMMITTED` transactions cannot access [`REGIONAL BY ROW`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables) tables.
- [Shared locks](#locking-reads) cannot yet be promoted to exclusive locks.
