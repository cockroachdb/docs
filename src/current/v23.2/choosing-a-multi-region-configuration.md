This page has high-level information about how to configure a [multi-region cluster's]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}) [survival goals]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#survival-goals) and [table localities]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#table-localities).

## Multi-region configuration options

The options for configuring your multi-region cluster include:

- _Change nothing_: Using the [default settings]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#default-settings), you get:
  - Zone survival (the default).
  - Low-latency reads and writes from a single region.
  - A choice of low-latency stale reads or high-latency fresh reads from other regions (and high-latency fresh reads is the default).

- _Change only [survival goals]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#survival-goals)_: This configuration is useful for single-region apps that need higher levels of survival. In this configuration, you move from availability zone (AZ) survival to get:
  - Region survival.
  - Low-latency reads from a single region.
  - A choice of low-latency stale reads or high-latency fresh reads from other regions (and high-latency fresh reads is the default).
  - Higher-latency writes from all regions (due to region survival).

- _Change only [table localities]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#table-localities)_: This is useful for multi-region apps that require different read and write latency guarantees for different tables in the database, and are not concerned with surviving a region failure. In this configuration, you get:
  - Zone survival (the default).
  - For [global tables]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/table-localities.md %}#global-tables), low-latency reads from all regions.
  - For [regional by row tables]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/table-localities.md %}#regional-by-row-tables), low-latency reads and writes from each row's [home region]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/alter-table.md %}#crdb_region), and low-latency [follower reads]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/follower-reads.md %}) from all other regions.

- _Change both [survival goals]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#survival-goals) and [table localities]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}#table-localities)_: This is useful for multi-region apps that want a high level of survival. In this configuration, you move from zone survival and get:
  - Region survival.
  - Low-latency reads from all regions.
  - Higher-latency writes from all regions (due to region survival).

## Configuration options vs. performance characteristics and application styles

The following table offers another view of how the various configuration options map to:

- The performance characteristics of specific survival goal and table locality combinations.
- The types of applications that can benefit from each combination.

Low-latency consistent [stale reads]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/follower-reads.md %}) from outside the row's home region. Higher-latency writes if writing to a row from outside its home region. |

There should be minimal difference in write latencies between `ZONE` and `REGION` survival.                                                   |
|                                                                     | Multi-region apps that need low-latency reads of a "read-mostly" table.                                                   | Multi-region apps that need low-latency reads of a "read-mostly" table and must survive a region failure.                                                                                                            |


Different databases and tables within the same cluster can each use different combinations of these settings.
