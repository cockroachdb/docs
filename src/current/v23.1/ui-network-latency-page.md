The **Network Latency** page displays round-trip latencies between all nodes in your cluster. Latency is the time required to transmit a packet across a network, and is highly dependent on your network topology. Use this page to determine whether your latency is appropriate for your [topology pattern]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/topology-patterns.md %}), or to identify nodes with unexpected latencies.

To view this page, [access the DB Console]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}#db-console-access) and click **Network Latency** in the left-hand navigation.

## Sort and filter network latency

Use the **Sort By** menu to arrange the latency matrix by [locality]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start.md %}#locality) (e.g., cloud, region, availability zone, datacenter).

Use the **Filter** menu to select specific nodes or localities to view.

Select **Collapse Nodes** to display the mean latencies of each locality, depending on how the matrix is sorted. This is a way to quickly assess cross-regional or cross-cloud latency.

## Understanding the Network Latency matrix

Each cell in the matrix displays the round-trip latency in milliseconds between two nodes in your cluster. Round-trip latency includes the return time of a packet. Latencies are color-coded by their standard deviation from the mean latency on the network: green for lower values, and blue for higher.

Rows represent origin nodes, and columns represent destination nodes. Hover over a cell to see round-trip latency and locality metadata for origin and destination nodes.

On a [typical multi-region cluster]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-low-latency-multi-region-deployment.md %}), you can expect much lower latencies between nodes in the same region/availability zone. Nodes in different regions/availability zones, meanwhile, will experience higher latencies that reflect their geographical distribution.

For instance, the cluster shown above has nodes in `us-west1`, `us-east1`, and `europe-west2`. Latencies are highest between nodes in `us-west1` and `europe-west2`, which span the greatest distance. This is especially clear when sorting by region or availability zone and collapsing nodes:

### No connections

Nodes that have lost a connection are displayed in a separate color. This can help you locate a network partition in your cluster.

{% include common/network-partitions.md %}

Click the **NO CONNECTIONS** link to see lost connections between nodes or [localities]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start.md %}#locality), if any are defined.

Network latency limits the performance of individual operations. You can use the [Statements]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-statements-page.md %}) page to see the latencies of SQL statements on gateway nodes.
