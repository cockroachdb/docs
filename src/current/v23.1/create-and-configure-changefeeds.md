Core and {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds offer different levels of configurability. {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds allow for active changefeed jobs to be [paused](#pause), [resumed](#resume), and [canceled](#cancel).

This page describes:

- [Guidelines](#before-you-create-a-changefeed) to consider before creating a changefeed.
- [Reference examples](#configure-a-changefeed) for creating and managing a changefeed.

## Before you create a changefeed

- Enable rangefeeds on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} and {{ site.data.products.core }}. Refer to [Enable rangefeeds](#enable-rangefeeds) for instructions.
- Plan the number of changefeeds versus the number of tables to include in a single changefeed for your cluster. Refer to [Recommendations for the number of target tables](#recommendations-for-the-number-of-target-tables).
- Read the [Considerations](#considerations) section that provides information on changefeed interactions that could affect how you configure or run your changefeed.

### Considerations

- If you require [`resolved`](create-changefeed.html#resolved-option) message frequency under `30s`, then you **must** set the [`min_checkpoint_frequency`](create-changefeed.html#min-checkpoint-frequency) option to at least the desired `resolved` frequency.
- Many DDL queries (including [`TRUNCATE`](truncate.html), [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.html), and queries that add a column family) will cause errors on a changefeed watching the affected tables. You will need to [start a new changefeed](create-changefeed.html#start-a-new-changefeed-where-another-ended). If a table is truncated that a changefeed with `on_error='pause'` is watching, you will also need to start a new changefeed. See change data capture [Known Limitations](change-data-capture-overview.html) for more detail.
- Partial or intermittent sink unavailability may impact changefeed stability. If a sink is unavailable, messages can't send, which means that a changefeed's high-water mark timestamp is at risk of falling behind the cluster's [garbage collection window](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-zone-variables). Throughput and latency can be affected once the sink is available again. However, [ordering guarantees](changefeed-messages.html#ordering-guarantees) will still hold for as long as a changefeed [remains active](monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#monitor-a-changefeed).
- When an [`IMPORT INTO`](import-into.html) statement is run, any current changefeed jobs targeting that table will fail.
- After you [restore from a full-cluster backup](restore.html#full-cluster), changefeed jobs will **not** resume on the new cluster. It is necessary to manually create the changefeeds following the full-cluster restore.

### Recommendations for the number of target tables

When creating a changefeed, it's important to consider the number of changefeeds versus the number of tables to include in a single changefeed:

- Changefeeds each have their own memory overhead, so every running changefeed will increase total memory usage.
- Creating a single changefeed that will watch hundreds of tables can affect the performance of a changefeed by introducing coupling, where the performance of a target table affects the performance of the changefeed watching it. For example, any [schema change](changefeed-messages.html#schema-changes) on any of the tables will affect the entire changefeed's performance.

To watch multiple tables, we recommend creating a changefeed with a comma-separated list of tables. However, we do **not** recommend creating a single changefeed for watching hundreds of tables.

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/recommendation-monitoring-pts.md %}

#### System resources and running changefeeds

Cockroach Labs recommends monitoring [CPU usage](ui-overload-dashboard.html) when you are running more than 10 changefeeds on a cluster. A larger cluster will be able to run more changefeeds concurrently compared to a smaller cluster with more limited resources.

To maintain more running changefeeds in your cluster:

- Connect to different nodes to create each changefeed. The node on which you start the changefeed will become the _coordinator_ node for the changefeed job. The coordinator node acts as an administrator: keeping track of all other nodes during job execution and the changefeed work as it completes. As a result, this node will use more resources for the changefeed job. Refer to [How does an Enterprise changefeed work?](change-data-capture-overview.html#how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work) for more detail.
- Consider logically grouping the target tables into one changefeed. When a changefeed pauses, it will stop emitting messages for the target tables. Grouping tables of related data into a single changefeed may make sense for your workload. However, we do not recommend watching hundreds of tables in a single changefeed. Refer to [Garbage collection and changefeeds](changefeed-messages.html#garbage-collection-and-changefeeds) for more detail on protecting data from garbage collection when a changefeed is paused.

## Enable rangefeeds

Changefeeds connect to a long-lived request (i.e., a rangefeed), which pushes changes as they happen. This reduces the latency of row changes, as well as reduces transaction restarts on tables being watched by a changefeed for some workloads.

**Rangefeeds must be enabled for a changefeed to work.** To [enable the cluster setting](set-cluster-setting.html):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.rangefeed.enabled = true;
~~~

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/cdc-cloud-rangefeed.md %}

Any created changefeeds will error until this setting is enabled. Note that enabling rangefeeds currently has a small performance cost (about a 5-10% increase in latencies), whether or not the rangefeed is being used in a changefeed.

The `kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html) can be used with changefeeds. Resolved timestamps will always be behind by at least the duration configured by this setting. However, decreasing the duration leads to more transaction restarts in your cluster, which can affect performance.

The following Enterprise and Core sections outline how to create and configure each type of changefeed:

## Configure a changefeed

An {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed streams row-level changes in a configurable format to a configurable sink (i.e., Kafka or a cloud storage sink). You can [create](#create), [pause](#pause), [resume](#resume), and [cancel](#cancel) an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed. For a step-by-step example connecting to a specific sink, see the [Changefeed Examples](changefeed-examples.html) page.

### Create

To create an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE table_name, table_name2 INTO '{scheme}://{host}:{port}?{query_parameters}';
~~~

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/url-encoding.md %}

When you create a changefeed **without** specifying a sink, CockroachDB sends the changefeed events to the SQL client. Consider the following regarding the [display format](cockroach-sql.html#sql-flag-format) in your SQL client:

- If you do not define a display format, the CockroachDB SQL client will automatically use `ndjson` format.
- If you specify a display format, the client will use that format (e.g., `--format=csv`).
- If you set the client display format to `ndjson` and set the changefeed [`format`](create-changefeed.html#format) to `csv`, you'll receive JSON format with CSV nested inside.
- If you set the client display format to `csv` and set the changefeed [`format`](create-changefeed.html#format) to `json`, you'll receive a comma-separated list of JSON values.

For more information, see [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](create-changefeed.html).

### Show

To show a list of {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed jobs:

For more information, refer to [`SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB`](show-jobs.html#show-changefeed-jobs).

### Pause

To pause an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
PAUSE JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, refer to [`PAUSE JOB`](pause-job.html).

### Resume

To resume a paused {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}

## Create a changefeed

A core changefeed streams row-level changes to the client indefinitely until the underlying connection is closed or the changefeed is canceled.

To create a core changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR table_name;
~~~

For more information, see [`EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR`](changefeed-for.html).
