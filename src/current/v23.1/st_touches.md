title: ST_Touches
summary: ST_Touches(A, B) returns true if A and B have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not intersect.

Given two shapes _A_ and _B_, `ST_Touches(A, B)` returns `true` if both the following are true:

- At least one point in the set of points that comprises _A_ is also a member of the set of points that make up _B_.
- No points that make up the interior of _A_ are also part of the interior of _B_.

In other words, _A_ and _B_ have a point along their boundaries in common (i.e., they "touch"), but none of their interior points intersect.  This distinction between shapes touching along a boundary vs. intersecting is also made by the [DE-9IM](spatial-glossary.html#de-9IM) standard.

`ST_Touches` works on the following data types:

- [`GEOMETRY`](spatial-glossary.html#geometry)

{% if page.has_prefixed_variant %}
{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`{{page.title}}` will attempt to use any available [spatial index](spatial-indexes.html) to speed up its operation.  Use the prefixed variant `_{{page.title}}` if you do not want any spatial indexes to be used.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}
{% endif %}

## Examples

{% include {{page.version.version}}/misc/geojson_geometry_note.md %}

### True

In this example, `{{page.title}}` returns `true` because both of the following are true:

- At least one point in the set of Points that comprise Polygon _A_ is a member of the set of points that make up the LineString _B_.
- No points from the interior of _A_ are also part of the interior of _B_.

### False

In this example, `{{page.title}}` returns `false` because:

- Some points from the interior of the LineString _B_ are also part of the interior of the Polygon _A_.
