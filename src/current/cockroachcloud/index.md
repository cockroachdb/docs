### Compute

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="basic">

For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}, compute is usage-based and calculated in Request Units.

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="standard">

A CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} cluster's provisioned compute capacity is configured when the cluster is created and can be modified over time. This capacity represents the peak processing power the deployment can handle at any given time.

Provisioned compute is calculated in vCPU-hours, with rates depending on the cloud provider and the region. Billing is based on the capacity reserved, not the actual usage. Charges are accumulated throughout the month to determine the total monthly compute charges.

In a multi-region cluster, the price of the most expensive region is applied to the entire clusterâ€™s compute capacity. The compute cost is calculated by multiplying the total provisioned capacity by the highest rate per vCPU-hour among all regions.

Refer to [Pricing](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/).

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="advanced">

Each node of a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} cluster is provisioned with dedicated vCPU resources. You can [customize]({% link cockroachcloud/create-an-advanced-cluster.md %}#step-5-configure-cluster-capacity) the number of vCPUs per node. This configuration applies to all nodes in the cluster. Compute costs are based on the vCPUs provisioned for each node, at rates that vary rates depending on the cloud provider and region.

Compute charges are calculated hourly by multiplying the hourly rate of the provisioned compute per node and number of nodes per cluster. These charges are accumulated throughout the month to determine the total monthly compute charges. When you configure your cluster's capacity, you are implicitly selecting a _machine type_ offered by the cloud provider. Different machine types are billed at different rates. The hourly compute cost is calculated by multiplying the hourly rate of the machine type by the number of nodes.

Refer to [Pricing](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/).

### Storage

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
There is no charge for backup storage during [Usage-based backup metrics Preview]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version}}/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md %}#backup-and-restore)
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="basic">

Storage for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }} is automatically provisioned on demand, eliminating the need for manual management. Costs are based on actual usage and adjust dynamically as data is added or removed, starting from zero.

Storage is billed hourly. Refer to [Pricing](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing).

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="standard">

Storage for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} is automatically provisioned on demand, eliminating the need for manual management. Costs are based on actual usage and adjust dynamically as data is added or removed, starting from zero.

A CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} cluster maintains a minimum of three replicas of your data, which are maintained at no additional cost. If you add further replicas, each will incur a storage cost equal to that of the logical database size. For more details, refer to [Plan a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster.md %}).

Storage is billed hourly, with [rates](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing) specific to each cloud provider and the region where the cluster is hosted. CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} measures storage in GiB-hour. Hourly storage charges are accumulated throughout the month to determine the total monthly storage charges.

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="advanced">

Each CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} cluster is provisioned with dedicated storage, configured when the cluster is created. The storage configuration applies to all nodes in the cluster. Storage is billed hourly, with [rates](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing) depending on the cluster's cloud provider and regions. Storage costs are independent of compute costs, and you can adjust your cluster's storage capacity without altering its vCPU or memory configurations. Refer to [Plan a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster-advanced.md %}).

- **AWS**: For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} on AWS, storage charges are calculated per hour by multiplying the storage size in GiB by the hourly rate charged by AWS, plus any additional charges for IOPS.
- **GCP and Azure**: For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} on GCP or Azure, storage charges are calculated per hour by multiplying the storage size in GiB by the hourly rate charged by the cloud provider, with no additional fees for IOPS.

Hourly storage charges are accumulated throughout the month to determine the total monthly storage charges.

### Data transfer

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
There is no charge for data transfer during [Usage-based backup metrics Preview]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version}}/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md %}#backup-and-restore)
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="basic">
For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}, data transfer is included in the Request Unit price.
</section>

{% capture standard_and_advanced_data_transfer %}
The usage data is based on the volume of data transferred (per GiB), using the cloud provider's rate for the type of data transfer: to the same region, across regions, or across the public internet.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture standard_and_advanced_cross_and_public %}
- **Cross-region**: When data is transferred from one region to another, this incurs additional cross-region charges, also known as inter-region charges. Data transfer across regions typically incurs higher costs than same-region transfer.
- **Public internet**: When data, manual backups, or logs are transferred or exported out of your cluster to SQL clients, third-party tools or storage, it is classified as public-internet data transfer.
{% endcapture %}

Cloud providers may calculate each category differently. Refer to the documentation for the Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="standard">
For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }}, data transfer is billed based on usage.

{{ standard_and_advanced_data_transfer }}

- **Same-region**: CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} stores data in three availability zones (AZs) per region. Data transfer among the AZs in the same region is classified as same-region data transfer.
{{ standard_and_advanced_cross_and_public }}

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="advanced">
For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }}, data transfer is billed based on usage.

{{ standard_and_advanced_data_transfer }}

- **Same-region**: CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} requires a minimum of three nodes per region, in three availability zones (AZs). Data transfer among the AZs in the same region is classified as same-region data transfer.
{{ standard_and_advanced_cross_and_public }}

### Changefeeds

All CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} clusters can use [Enterprise Changefeeds]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version}}/how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work.md %}).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
There is no charge for changefeeds during [Usage-based backup metrics Preview]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version}}/essential-metrics-self-hosted.md %}#backup-and-restore)
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="basic">

In CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}, Change Data Capture is included in the Request Unit price.
</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="standard">

- &lt; 5 GiB/month
- 5-100 GiB/month
- 100-250 GiB/month
- &gt; 250 GiB/month
