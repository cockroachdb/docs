title: Backup and Restore Monitoring
summary: An overview of backup and restore monitoring features for CockroachDB Cloud deployments.
toc: true
---

CockroachDB includes metrics to monitor [backup]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/backup.md %}), [restore]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/restore.md %}), and [scheduled backup]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}) jobs. You can use monitoring integrations to alert when there are anomalies, such as backups that have failed or restore jobs encountering a retryable error. We recommend setting up monitoring to alert when anomalies occur.

Depending on the tier of your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} cluster, you can use the following tools to monitor backup and restore metrics:

|              | CockroachDB Standard | CockroachDB Advanced | CockroachDB Basic |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| [Cloud Console Metrics page]({% link cockroachcloud/metrics.md %}#cockroachdb-cloud-console-metrics-page) | ✔ | ✔ | ✔           |
| [Prometheus](#prometheus)   | ✔                    | ✔                    |                   |
| [Datadog](#datadog)         | ✔                    | ✔                    |                   |

You can then use the following SQL statements to inspect details relating to schedules, jobs, and backups:

- [`SHOW SCHEDULES`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/show-schedules.md %})
- [`SHOW JOBS`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/show-jobs.md %})
- [`SHOW BACKUP`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/show-backup.md %})

For detail on [managed backups]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}) that Cockroach Labs stores for your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} cluster, refer to the **Backup and Restore** page in the Cloud Console.

## Prometheus

This section outlines the available backup and restore job metrics with Prometheus. For instructions on accessing the `metricexport` endpoint for Prometheus, refer to:

- [Export Metrics From a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} Cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/export-metrics-advanced.md %}?filters=prometheus-metrics-export).
- [Export Metrics From a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} Cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/export-metrics.md %}?filters=prometheus-metrics-export).

We recommend the following guidelines:

- Use the `schedules.BACKUP.last-completed-time` metric to monitor the specific backup job or jobs you would use to recover from a disaster.
- Configure alerting on the `schedules.BACKUP.last-completed-time` metric to watch for cases where the timestamp has not moved forward as expected.

Metric | Description
-------+-------------
`schedules.BACKUP.failed` | The number of scheduled backup jobs that have failed. **Note:** A stuck scheduled job will not increment this metric.
`schedules.BACKUP.last-completed-time` | The Unix timestamp of the most recently completed scheduled backup specified as maintaining this metric. **Note:** This metric only updates if the schedule was created with the [`updates_cluster_last_backup_time_metric` option]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#schedule-options).
`schedules.BACKUP.protected_age_sec` | The age of the oldest [protected timestamp record]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#protected-timestamps-and-scheduled-backups) protected by backup schedules.
`schedules.BACKUP.protected_record_count` | The number of [protected timestamp records]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#protected-timestamps-and-scheduled-backups) held by backup schedules.
`schedules.BACKUP.started` | The number of scheduled backup jobs that have started.
`schedules.BACKUP.succeeded` | The number of scheduled backup jobs that have succeeded.
`schedules.round.reschedule_skip` | The number of schedules that were skipped due to a currently running job. A value greater than 0 indicates that a previous backup was still running when a new scheduled backup was supposed to start. This corresponds to the [`on_previous_running=skip`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#on-previous-running-option) schedule option.
`schedules.round.reschedule_wait` | The number of schedules that were rescheduled due to a currently running job. A value greater than 0 indicates that a previous backup was still running when a new scheduled backup was supposed to start. This corresponds to the [`on_previous_running=wait`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#on-previous-running-option) schedule option.
`jobs.backup.currently_paused` | The number of backup jobs currently considered [paused]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/pause-job.md %}).
`jobs.backup.currently_running` | The number of backup jobs currently running in `Resume` or `OnFailOrCancel` state.
`jobs.backup.fail_or_cancel_retry_error` | The number of backup jobs that failed with a retryable error on their failure or cancelation process.
`jobs.backup.fail_or_cancel_completed` | The number of backup jobs that successfully completed their failure or cancelation process.
`jobs.backup.fail_or_cancel_failed` | The number of backup jobs that failed with a non-retryable error on their failure or cancelation process.
`jobs.backup.protected_age_sec` | The age of the oldest [protected timestamp record]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#protected-timestamps-and-scheduled-backups) protected by backup jobs.
`jobs.backup.protected_record_count` | The number of [protected timestamp records]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/create-schedule-for-backup.md %}#protected-timestamps-and-scheduled-backups) held by backup jobs.
`jobs.backup.resume_failed` | The number of backup jobs that failed with a non-retryable error.
`jobs.backup.resume_retry_error` | The number of backup jobs that failed with a retryable error.
`jobs.restore.currently_paused` | The number of restore jobs currently considered [paused]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/pause-job.md %}).
`jobs.restore.currently_running` | The number of restore jobs currently running in `Resume` or `OnFailOrCancel` state.
`jobs.restore.fail_or_cancel_failed` | The number of restore jobs that failed with a non-retriable error on their failure or cancelation process.
`jobs.restore.fail_or_cancel_retry_error` | The number of restore jobs that failed with a retryable error on their failure or cancelation process.
`jobs.restore.protected_age_sec` | The age of the oldest [protected timestamp record]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#protected-timestamps) protected by restore jobs.
`jobs.restore.protected_record_count` | The number of [protected timestamp records]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#protected-timestamps) held by restore jobs.
`jobs.restore.resume_completed` | The number of restore jobs that successfully resumed to completion.
`jobs.restore.resume_failed` | The number of restore jobs that failed with a non-retryable error.
`jobs.restore.resume_retry_error` | The number of restore jobs that failed with a retryable error.

## Datadog

You can export the following schedule backup metrics to Datadog using the [Cloud API]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-api.md %}), or access the Cloud Console **Monitoring** page to enable the integration.

For instructions, refer to:

- [Export Metrics From a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} Cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/export-metrics-advanced.md %}?filters=datadog-metrics-export).
