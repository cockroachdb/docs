This page walks you through the process of creating a cluster using CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }}. Note that only [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Org Administrators]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#org-administrator-legacy) or users with Cluster Creator / Cluster Admin roles assigned at organization scope can create clusters. If you are a Developer and need to create a cluster, contact your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Administrator.

## Before you begin

If you haven't already, <a href="https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup?referralId=docs_create_serverless_cluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up for a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} account</a>.

{% include cockroachcloud/free-cluster-limit.md %}

## Step 1. Start the cluster creation process

1. [Log in](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/) to your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} account.
{% include cockroachcloud/prefer-sso.md %}
1. If there are multiple [organizations](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/architecture/glossary#organization) in your account, select the correct organization in the top right corner.
1. On the **Overview** page, click **Create Cluster**.

## Step 2. Select the cloud provider

Select a cloud provider (GCP or AWS) in the **Cloud provider** section. Creating a Serverless cluster on Azure is not supported.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You do not need an account with the cloud provider you choose in order to create a cluster on that cloud provider. The cluster is created on infrastructure managed by Cockroach Labs. If you have existing cloud services on either GCP or AWS that you intend to use with your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster, you should select that cloud provider and the region closest to your existing cloud services to maximize performance.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 3. Select the regions

In the **Regions** section, select a region for the cluster. Refer to [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Regions]({% link cockroachcloud/regions.md %}) for the regions where CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters can be deployed.

For optimal performance, select the cloud provider and region nearest to where your SQL clients, applications, or external data are located. For multi-region clusters, CockroachDB will optimize access to data from the [**Primary region**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/multiregion-overview). Refer to [Plan a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} Cluster](plan-your-cluster-serverless.html#multi-region-clusters) to learn more. To express interest in additional regions, [contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com) or your Cockroach Labs account team.

To create a multi-region cluster, click **Add regions** and select additional regions. A cluster can have at most six regions.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
**Multi-region for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} is in [preview](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability)** and subject to change. You cannot currently add or remove regions once a cluster has been created. To share feedback and/or issues, contact [Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

After creating a multi-region cluster deployed on AWS, you can optionally [set up AWS PrivateLink (Limited Access)]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %}#aws-privatelink) so that incoming connections to your cluster from applications or services running in your AWS account flow over private AWS network infrastructure rather than the public internet.

Private connectivity is not available for {{ site.data.products.serverless-plan }} clusters on GCP.

## Step 4. Set resource limits

Your cluster's [resource limits](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/architecture/glossary#resource-limits) are the maximum amount of storage and RUs you can use in a month. If you reach your storage limit, your cluster will be throttled and you may only be able to delete data. If you reach your RU limit, your cluster will be disabled until the end of the billing cycle unless you raise the limit.

All CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organizations get 50M RUs and 10 GiB of storage for free each month. Free resources can be spent across all CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters in an organization. You can set higher resource limits to maintain a high level of performance with larger workloads. You will only be charged for what you use.

{% include cockroachcloud/serverless-usage.md %} For more information, see [Planning your cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster.md %}).

<div class="filters clearfix">
  <button class="filter-button page-level" data-scope="free">Free</button>
  <button class="filter-button page-level" data-scope="paid">Paid</button>
</div>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="free">

1. Select the **Start for free** option.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    This will only be available if you haven't already created a free CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster or set up billing information.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Click **Create cluster**.

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="paid">

1. If the option to **Start for free** is still available to you, select **Upgrade your resources** instead.

1. Enter your **Resource limits**.
    - If you select **Set a monthly limit**, you can set storage and RU limits individually, or enter a dollar amount that will be split automatically between both resources. You will only be charged for the resources you use.
    - If you select **Unlimited**, your cluster will scale to meet your application's needs. You will only be charged for the resources you use.

1. Click **Next: Payment**.

1. Verify your cluster configuration and [resource limits](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/architecture/glossary#resource-limits).

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    The cost displayed does not include taxes.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Add your preferred [payment method]({% link cockroachcloud/billing-management.md %}).

1. Click **Create cluster**.

</section>

Your cluster will be created in a few seconds.
