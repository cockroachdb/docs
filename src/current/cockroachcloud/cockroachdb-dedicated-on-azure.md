## FAQs

### What does limited access refer to regarding the availability of CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} on Azure?

CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} on Azure is fully managed, just like CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} on GCP or AWS. During [limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/cockroachdb-feature-availability), your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organization must be enrolled before you can start using CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} on Azure.

The clusters created during this period are recommended for proof-of-concept and testing, and are not suitable for production. The [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://cockroachlabs.com/cloud-terms-and-conditions/cockroachcloud-technical-service-level-agreement/) is not applicable to Azure clusters during limited access. Azure clusters are excluded from premium support agreements during limited access, and technical support is only available during business hours.

### Can we create multi-region dedicated clusters on Azure?

Not yet. During [limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/cockroachdb-feature-availability), a cluster can be created only in a single region, and a cluster must have three or more nodes. A cluster's nodes are automatically placed in different [availability zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) to ensure resiliency to failure of a single availability zone.

### Is it possible to horizontally scale a dedicated cluster on Azure?

Not yet.

### What Azure regions can we choose to create the dedicated clusters?

You can create a cluster in `eastus2` (US East Coast - Virginia) or `westeurope` (Netherlands) during the limited access period. Contact your account team to express interest in other regions.

### What kind of compute and storage resources are used for the dedicated clusters on Azure?

CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters on Azure use [Dasv5-series VMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/dasv5-dadsv5-series) and [Premium SSDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds). This configuration was selected for its optimum price-performance ratio after thorough performance testing across VM families and storage types.

### We use CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} credits to pay for our usage on AWS or GCP. Is it possible to use those same credits for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters on Azure?

Yes, existing CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} customers can pay for the usage of CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters on Azure with their available credits.
