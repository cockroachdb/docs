To view and manage a specific cluster, click the name of the cluster. The [**Overview**](#view-cluster-overview) page will display.

## View cluster overview

The [**Overview** page]({% link cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page.md %}) displays details about the selected CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} cluster.

From the **Overview** page, you can connect to your cluster. For more information, refer to [Connect to Your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} Cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/connect-to-your-cluster.md %}).

## Add a region to your cluster

## Configure PCI ready features

CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters have a **PCI ready** panel to monitor the status of security features required for [PCI DSS readiness]({% link cockroachcloud/pci-dss.md %}). Feature statuses will update from **INACTIVE** to **ACTIVE** once you configure them. Learn more about configuring these features:

- [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Organization Audit logs]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-org-audit-logs.md %})
- [Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-cmek.md %})
- [Egress Perimeter Controls]({% link cockroachcloud/egress-perimeter-controls.md %})
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for your [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organization]({% link cockroachcloud/configure-cloud-org-sso.md %}) and your [clusters]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-sso-sql.md %})
- [Network security]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %})

You can also check the status of these features on the [**PCI ready**]({% link cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page.md %}?filters=dedicated#pci-ready-dedicated-advanced) page of the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console.

## Restore data from a backup

Refer to [Managed-Service Backups]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}) for instructions to restore your cluster from an automatic cluster backup.

You can also [back up and restore]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}) your cluster manually. You can take [backups locally]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}) to [`userfile`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/use-userfile-storage.md %}) or [back up to cloud storage]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}).

## Enable deletion protection

To help prevent a cluster from being deleted by mistake, you can enable _deletion protection_. Before you can delete a cluster with deletion protection enabled, you must disable deletion protection. A user with permission to delete a cluster can enable deletion protection on the same cluster.

1. Navigate to the **Overview** page for the cluster you want to protect.
1. If deletion protection is disabled, click the pencil icon next to it. Toggle the setting, then click **Save**.

## Delete cluster

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Deleting a cluster will delete all cluster data.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Proceed with the following steps only if you are sure you want to delete a cluster:

1. Navigate to the **Overview** page for the cluster you want to delete.
1. If [deletion protection](#enable-deletion-protection) is enabled, click the pencil icon next to it. Toggle the setting, then click **Save**.
1. Click the **Actions** button in the top right corner.
1. Select **Delete cluster**.
1. In the confirmation window, enter the name of the cluster.
1. Click **Delete**.
