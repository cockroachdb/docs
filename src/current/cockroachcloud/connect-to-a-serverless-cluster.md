This page shows you how to connect to your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster. If you'd like to follow along with a video walkthrough, see [How to connect to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} and Import Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJZD1rorEQE).

## Before you start

- [Create a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster]({% link cockroachcloud/create-a-serverless-cluster.md %}).
- [Create a new SQL user]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-access.md %}#create-a-sql-user).
- Understand [Network Authorization for CockroachDB Cloud Clusters]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %})

## Authorize your network

On creation, a Serverless cluster is open to all traffic as it is created with a `0.0.0.0/0` IP allowlist.

It is recommended to restrict your network to allow access only from specific IP address ranges controlled by your organization. These might include specific networks for your application deployments, hardened administrator access points, or backup-restore pipelines for disaster recovery. Therefore, if possible you should replace the `0.0.0.0/0` allowlist entry with more specific CIDR ranges for legitimate access.

Removing or adding an authorized network on your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster may take up to 30 seconds to take effect.

### Establish AWS PrivateLink

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
AWS PrivateLink for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} is in **[limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/cockroachdb-feature-availability)** and is only available for multi-region CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters deployed on AWS. To enroll your organization, contact your Cockroach Labs account team. This feature is subject to change.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Amazon Web Services (AWS) PrivateLink support allows customers to establish SQL access to their clusters entirely through private AWS infrastructure, without exposure to the public internet, affording enhanced security and performance.

To configure PrivateLink, you create the AWS PrivateLink connection in your AWS account, then configure your cluster to allow connections from your private endpoint. For more information and detailed instructions, refer to [Network Authorization: AWS PrivateLink]({% link cockroachcloud/network-authorization.md %}#aws-privatelink).

AWS PrivateLink can be configured only after the cluster is created. For detailed instructions, refer to [Managing AWS PrivateLink for a cluster](aws-privatelink.html?filter-content=serverless).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Private connectivity is not available for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters on GCP.

## Connect to your cluster

1. Select your cluster to navigate to the cluster [**Overview** page]({% link cockroachcloud/cluster-overview-page.md %}).

1. In the top right corner of the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console, click the **Connect** button.

    The **Connect to cluster** dialog displays.

1. _(Optional)_ If you have multiple SQL users or databases, you can:
    - Select the SQL user you want to connect with from the **SQL user** dropdown.
    - Select the database you want to connect to from the **Database** dropdown.

1. Select a connection method from the **Select option / Language** dropdown (the instructions below will adjust accordingly):

    <div class="filters clearfix">
        <button class="filter-button page-level" data-scope="command-line">Command line</button>
        <button class="filter-button page-level" data-scope="connection-string">General connection string</button>
        <button class="filter-button page-level" data-scope="connection-parameters">Connection parameters</button>
    </div>

  <section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="connection-string">

1. In the **Download CA Cert** section of the dialog, you can optionally download the CA certificate. The CA certificate is signed by Let's Encrypt, which may already be trusted by your local system. However, some use cases, such as developing with Python, do not use the operating system's local certificate store and require the CA certificate to be available locally. When developing with Javascript or Node, you do not need to download the CA certificate locally. To download the CA certificate, select your operating system, then use the command provided to download the CA certificate to the default PostgreSQL certificate directory on your machine.
1. If you [established a private connection using AWS PrivateLink](#establish-aws-privatelink), change **Connection type** from **Public connection** to **Private connection** to connect privately.
1. Copy the connection string provided in the **General connection string** section of the dialog, which will be used to connect your application to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }}.
1. Add your copied connection string to your application code. For information about connecting to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} with a [supported client](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/third-party-database-tools), see [Connect to a CockroachDB Cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{ site.current_cloud_version }}/connect-to-the-database).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If you forget your SQL user's password, an [Org Administrator]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#org-administrator) or a Cluster Admin on the cluster can change the password on the **SQL Users** page.

You can connect to your cluster with any [supported version](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/release-support-policy#current-supported-releases) of the full CockroachDB binary or the [built-in SQL client](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroach-sql). To download the full binary and connect to a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster, follow these steps.

1. Select **CockroachDB Client** from the **Select option/language** dropdown.
1. In the **Download CA Cert** section of the dialog, you can optionally download the CA certificate. The CA certificate is signed by Let's Encrypt, which may already be trusted by your local system.

To download the CA certificate, select your operating system, then use the command provided to download the CA certificate to the default PostgreSQL certificate directory on your machine.
1. In the **Download the latest CockroachDB Client** section of the dialog, select your operating system, and use the command provided to install the latest downloadable version of CockroachDB on your local system.
1. If you [established a private connection using AWS PrivateLink](#establish-aws-privatelink), change **Connection type** from **Public connection** to **Private connection** to connect privately.
1. Copy the [`cockroach sql`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroach-sql) command and connection string provided in the **Connect** dialog, which will be used in the next step (and to connect to your cluster in the future).
1. In your terminal, enter the copied `cockroach sql` command and connection string to start the [built-in SQL client](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroach-sql.html).

    A welcome message displays:

    ~~~
    #
    # Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.
    # All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
    # To exit, type: \q.
    #
    ~~~

    You are now connected to the built-in SQL client, and can now run [CockroachDB SQL statements]({% link cockroachcloud/learn-cockroachdb-sql.md %}).
