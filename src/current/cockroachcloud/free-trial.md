When you sign up for CockroachDB Cloud, your new organization's account starts with $400 in free credits, allowing you to try the product at no cost.

## Free trial credits

Free trial credits are applied to the first $400 in costs for all clusters created in your organization, regardless of the plan: CockroachDB CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }}, CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }}, or CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}.

Monthly billing begins when the free trial ends: on the day that the last credit is used, or upon expiration of credit, if any remains. By the end of the trial, you must provide a payment method for continued billing to prevent interruptions in service or loss of data.

### Eligibility

For a user who signs up with CockroachDB Cloud, only their first organization is eligible for free trial credits. Users invited to an organization do not qualify for additional credits. If provided with necessary permissions, such users can create clusters that will share the organization's existing credits.

The free trial offer does not apply to organizations that are billed by invoice.

### View your credit balance

To check your free credit balance and see how much time is remaining before your free credit expires, navigate to the [Get Started](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/get-started) page or your [Billing](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/billing/overview) overview in the CockroachDB Cloud Console.

## Free trial notifications

During your free trial, you will receive email notifications from Cockroach Labs with information about the status of your trial. These emails are sent to Org Administrators and Billing Coordinators.

An email is sent when:

* The trial begins, providing terms and resources for getting started.
* 50% of credits have been consumed or less than 15 days remain before credits expire.
* 75% of credits have been consumed or less than 7 days remain before credits expire.
* The trial ends (all credits have been consumed or have expired).
* Less than 24 hours remain in a post-expiration grace period.
* The grace period ends, and trial clusters are deleted.

If you enter a payment method before the end of your free trial, you will not receive further email notifications about the trial. For more details, refer to [Add payment methods](#add-payment-methods).

## Estimate costs

To understand how costs vary per tier and begin to estimate future expenses, refer to [CockroachDB Cloud Costs]({% link cockroachcloud/costs.md %}).

## Add payment methods

During the free trial, an Organization Admin can [add a credit card]({% link cockroachcloud/billing-management.md %}) in the CockroachDB Cloud Console or [subscribe through the AWS Marketplace]({% link cockroachcloud/billing-management.md %}?filters=marketplace) (pay as you go). You can also [contact Sales](https://cockroachlabs.com/contact-sales) during the trial to learn more about CockroachDB and consider invoice billing.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Callout: To avoid service disruption and possible data loss, be sure to enter a payment method or be in communication with Sales before your free trial ends.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

If the trial ends and a payment method has not been provided, a three-day grace period begins where your organizationâ€™s clusters operate normally, but you are restricted from modifying their configuration, for example, to scale up or down, or update regions.

The cluster will be fully restored if a payment method is added. Any charges accrued during the grace period will be billed to the payment method.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
If the end of the grace period is reached and no payment method has been added, all clusters in the organization are deleted.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}
