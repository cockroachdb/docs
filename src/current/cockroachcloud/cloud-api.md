title: Use the CockroachDB Cloud API
summary: The Cloud API is used to manage clusters within an organization
toc: true
docs_area: manage
cloud: true
---

The Cloud API is a [REST interface](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) that allows you programmatic access to manage the lifecycle of clusters within your organization.

This document pertains to the `latest` version of the API's `v1` endpoints, `2024-09-16`. For more detailed coverage of API endpoints for this version and prior verisons, refer to the [API reference documentation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/api/cloud/v1). 

To manage clusters and other resources in CockroachDB Cloud, you can also use the [CockroachDB Cloud Terraform provider]({% link cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform.md %}), which implements the API.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If you used the API to manage CockroachDB Serverless clusters that have been migrated to CockroachDB Basic, ensure your code is updated to work with CockroachDB Basic.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Call the API

The API uses [bearer token authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and each request requires a [secret key]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-access.md %}#api-access). The secret key is associated with a service account, and inherits the [permissions of the account]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-access.md %}#manage-service-accounts).

To send the secret key when making an API call, add the secret key to the `Authorization` HTTP header sent with the request.

Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}
~~~

</section>

Replace `{secret_key}` with the secret key string you stored when you [created the API key in the Console]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-access.md %}#create-api-keys).

## Set the API version

The Cloud API uses date-based versions of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`, in [ISO 8601 format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). It is strongly recommended that you use the `Cc-Version` HTTP header to specify the version of the Cloud API to use. If you omit the `Cc-Version` header, the Cloud API will default to the latest version. If you donâ€™t specify the version your application expects, breakage may occur. While we try to minimize the risk of breaking API changes, passing the version explicitly helps to mitigate against this risk and is strongly recommended.

If you set an invalid version, you will get an HTTP 400 response with the message "invalid Cc-Version."

## Create a cluster

Get started by creating a new CockroachDB [Basic](#create-a-basic-cluster), [Standard](#create-a-standard-cluster), or [Advanced](#create-an-advanced-cluster) cluster.

### Create a Basic cluster

To create a cluster, send a `POST` request to the `/v1/clusters` endpoint.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The service account associated with the secret key must have the Cluster Administrator or Cluster Creator [role]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-user-roles).

  - `{secret_key}` is the secret key for the service account.
  - `storage_mib_limit` is the maximum number of MiB of storage that the cluster can use at any time during the month. If this limit is exceeded, then the cluster is throttled, where only one SQL connection is allowed at a time, with the expectation that it is used to delete data to reduce storage usage. It is an error for this value to be zero.
  - `request_unit_limit` is the maximum number of request units that the cluster can consume during the month. If this limit is exceeded, then the cluster is disabled until the limit is increased, or until the beginning of the next month when more request units are granted. It is an error for this to be zero.

## Change a cluster's plan

This section shows how to change a cluster's plan using the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} API. To use Terraform instead, refer to [Provision a cluster with Terraform]({% link cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform.md %}#change-a-clusters-plan).
.
To change a cluster's plan from CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }} to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} in place:

1. Edit the API command or application code that was used to create the cluster. In the JSON header, replace the contents of `serverless {}` (which may be empty) with the provisioned vCPUs for the cluster. This field is required for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }}. It is not possible to set storage limitations on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }}. Refer to [CockroachDB API: Create a Standard cluster](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/api/cloud/v1.html#post-/api/v1/clusters) for the specification for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }}.
1. Run the command or application code.

To migrate from CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}:

1. Edit the API command or application code that was used to create the cluster. In the JSON header:
  - Replace the `serverless.usage_limits.provisioned_virtual_cpus` field with an empty value for no resource limits, or optionally values for `request_unit_limit` and `storage_mib_limit`. It is not possible to reserve compute on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}. Refer to [CockroachDB API: Create a Standard cluster](https://cockroachlabs.com/docs/docs/api/cloud/v1.html#post-/api/v1/clusters) for the specification for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}.
  - Remove configurations for features that are unsupported on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }}, such as private connectivity. Otherwise, running the updated command or application code will fail.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
To change a cluster's plan between CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }}, you must create and configure a new cluster, back up the existing cluster's data, and restore the backup to the new cluster. Migration in place is not supported. Refer to [Self-managed backups]({% link cockroachcloud/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}#self-managed-backups).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Delete a cluster

To delete a cluster, send a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}` endpoint.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The service account associated with the secret key must have the Cluster Administrator or Cluster Creator [role]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-user-roles).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Deleting a cluster will permanently delete the cluster and all the data within the cluster.

## Export Cloud Organization audit logs

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
{% include_cached feature-phases/limited-access.md %}
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To export audit logs for activities and events related to your Cloud organization, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/auditlogevents` endpoint.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The service account associated with the secret key must have the Cluster Administrator [role]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-user-roles).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/auditlogevents?starting_from={timestamp}&sort_order={sort_order}&limit={limit}' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}' \
  --header 'Cc-Version: {api_version}'
~~~

Where:

  - `{timestamp}` is an [RFC3339 timestamp](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) that indicates the first log entry to fetch. If unspecified, defaults to the time when the Cloud organization was created if `{sort_order}` is `ASC`, or the current time if `{sort_order}` is `DESC`.
  - `{sort_order}` is either `ASC` (the default) or `DESC`.
  - `{limit}` indicates roughly how many entries to return. If any entries would be returned for a timestamp, all entries for that timestamp are always returned. Defaults to `200`.
  - `{api_version}` is the [Cloud API version](#set-the-api-version).

A request that includes no parameters exports roughly 200 entries in ascending order, starting from when your CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organization was created.

If the request was successful, the client will receive a JSON array consisting of a list of log `entries` and, depending on the circumstances, a `next_starting_from` field.

- If `{sort_order}` is `ASC`, `next_starting_from` is always returned.
- If `{sort_order}` is `DESC`, then `next_starting_from` is returned as long as earlier audit logs are available. It is not returned when the earliest log entry is reached (when the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} organization was created).

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ json
{
  "entries": [
    "{entry_array}"
  ],
  "next_starting_from": "{timestamp}"
}
~~~

Where:

  - `{entry_array}` is a structured JSON array of audit log entries.
  - `{timestamp}` indicates the timestamp to send to export the next batch of results.

## List all clusters in an organization

    {<cluster_object1>},
    {<cluster_object2>},
    {<cluster_object3>}
  ],
  "pagination": null
}    
~~~

## List the available regions for a cloud provider

To list the [available regions]({% link cockroachcloud/regions.md %}) for creating new clusters, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/clusters/available-regions?provider={cloud_provider}` endpoint.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The service account associated with the secret key must have the Cluster Administrator or Cluster Developer [role]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-user-roles).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

    "<region_array>"
  ]
}
~~~

Where:

  - `<region_array>` is a string array of regions available from the cloud provider.

## List the SQL users in a cluster

To list the SQL users in a cluster, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/sql-users` endpoint.

~~~

Where:

  - `{cluster_id}` is the unique ID of this cluster.
  {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}

    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_page": "<next_page_token>"
  }
}
~~~

Where:
- `<SQL-username>` is the SQL username of the user.

To create a SQL user, send a `POST` request to the `/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/sql-users` endpoint.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The service account associated with the secret key must have the Cluster Administrator or Cluster Creator [role]({% link cockroachcloud/authorization.md %}#organization-user-roles).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
By default, a new SQL user created using the UI or Cloud API is granted the SQL `admin` role. An `admin` SQL user has full privileges for all databases and tables in the cluster, and can create additional SQL users and manage their privileges.
When possible, it is best practice to [limit each user's privileges]({% link cockroachcloud/managing-access.md %}#use-sql-roles-to-manage-access) to the minimum necessary for their tasks, in keeping with the [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://cockroachlabs.cloud/api/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/sql-users' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer {secret_key}' \
