{% include cockroachcloud/backups/managed-backup-description.md %}

You can configure the following in [{{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters](#standard-and-advanced-clusters):

- The frequency of the backups to meet [recovery point objective (RPO)]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/disaster-recovery-overview.md %}) requirements.
- The retention of the backups to set how long Cockroach Labs retains the backups.

[{{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters](#basic-clusters) have a default non-configurable schedule.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
In addition to managed backups, you can take manual backups to your own storage bucket with self-managed backups. Refer to the [Take and Restore Self-Managed Backups]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}) page.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Managed backup settings

You can modify the settings of managed backups in [{{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters](#standard-and-advanced-clusters).

[{{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters](#basic-clusters) have default settings that you cannot modify.

### Basic clusters

Cockroach Labs will take a managed backup every 24 hours. By default, managed backups will be retained for 30 days in {{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters.

When a {{ site.data.products.basic }} cluster is deleted, or the customerâ€™s agreement with Cockroach Labs has terminated, managed backups taken on the cluster will be retained for 30 days, after which the backups will be deleted.

Refer to the [Cloud Console](#restore-a-basic-cluster) section for details on viewing and managing the backups.

### Standard and Advanced clusters

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Configurable managed backup settings are available in all [supported versions]({% link releases/release-support-policy.md %}#supported-versions) of CockroachDB on {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

In {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters, you can configure the [frequency](#frequency) and [retention](#retention) of managed backups.

{{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters take a combination of full and incremental backups in order to meet the set frequency. The type of managed backup the cluster takes is **not** configurable. Each incremental backup is dependent on the last full backup, which has an effect on the managed backups that you can restore in the set retention period.

Full backups in the cluster will be deleted when they reach the set retention period. At this point, any incremental backups dependent on the deleted full backup will also be deleted. The Cloud Console will not list any backups that are beyond the set retention period, or incremental backups that cannot be restored.

For instructions on how to view and configure managed backup settings, use:

- The [Cloud Console](#cloud-console) for [{{ site.data.products.standard }}]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}?filters=standard#cloud-console) or [{{ site.data.products.advanced }}]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}?filters=advanced#cloud-console).
- The [Cloud API]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-api.md %}) for [{{ site.data.products.standard }}]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}?filters=standard#cloud-api-for-standard-clusters) or [{{ site.data.products.advanced }}]({% link cockroachcloud/managed-backups.md %}?filters=advanced#cloud-api-for-advanced-clusters).

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/full-backup-setting-change.md %}

#### Frequency

You can configure how frequently Cockroach Labs takes backups, which will determine the cluster's [RPO]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/disaster-recovery-overview.md %}).

You can set backup frequency to one of the following options:

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/frequency-settings.md %}

#### Retention

You can set your retention duration **once**. After you have adjusted the retention, the duration will only apply to new backups. The available retention options are:

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/retention-settings.md %}

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/retention-deleted-cluster.md %}

## Upgrades and downgrades

If you have upgraded from a {{ site.data.products.basic }} cluster to a {{ site.data.products.standard }} cluster, the existing backup schedules will still apply, but you can then configure the frequency and retention of future managed backups in the {{ site.data.products.standard }} cluster.

If you have downgraded from a {{ site.data.products.standard }} cluster to a {{ site.data.products.basic }} cluster, existing managed backups will be retained for the configured retention duration. The default managed backups in {{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters will be taken every 24 hours and have a 30-day retention.

## Considerations

- Every backup will be stored entirely in a single region, which is chosen at random from the list of cluster regions at the time of cluster creation. This region will be used indefinitely to store backups.
- You can perform a cross-cluster restore across {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters that belong to the same organization. However, this cross-cluster restore is not supported for {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters.
- You cannot restore a backup of a multi-region database into a single-region database.
- For details on managed backups and enabling CMEK in {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters, refer to [Backup and restore operations on a cluster with CMEK]({% link cockroachcloud/cmek.md %}#backup-and-restore-operations-on-a-cluster-with-cmek).

### View backups in a Basic cluster

Click on **Backup and Restore** in the **Data section** of the left-side navigation to access the **Backup Recovery** page.

This page displays a list of your cluster backups. Use the calendar drop-down to view all backups taken on a certain date.

For each backup, the following details display:

- **Data From**: The date and time the backup was taken.
- **Status**: The backup's status, `In Progress` or `Complete`.
- **Expires In**: The remaining number of days Cockroach Labs will [retain](#retention) the backup.
- **Restore**: Restore a particular cluster backup, click [**Restore**](#restore-a-basic-cluster) in the corresponding row.

### Restore a Basic cluster

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The restore completely erases all data in the destination cluster. All cluster data is replaced with the data from the backup. The destination cluster will be unavailable while the job is in progress.

This operation is disruptive and is to be performed with caution. Use the [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) as a golden rule when designing your system of privilege grants.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Performing a restore will cause your cluster to be unavailable for the duration of the restore. All current data is deleted, and the cluster will be restored to the state it was in at the time of the backup.

To restore a cluster:

1. Find the cluster backup on the **Backup Recovery** page.
1. Click **Restore** for the cluster you want to restore.

    The **Restore cluster** module displays with backup details.

1. You can restore a backup to the same cluster.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    If you need to restore data into a new or different cluster, use [self-managed backups]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}) or [contact support]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/support-resources.md %}).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Click **Restore**.

#### Restore an Advanced cluster

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The restore completely erases all data in the destination cluster. All cluster data is replaced with the data from the backup. The destination cluster will be unavailable while the job is in progress.

This operation is disruptive and is to be performed with caution. Use the [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) as a golden rule when designing your system of privilege grants.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To restore a cluster:

1. Find the cluster backup on the **Backups** tab.
1. Click **Restore** for the cluster you want to restore.

    The **Restore cluster** module displays with backup details.

1. Select the cluster to restore to. You can restore to either the same cluster or a different {{ site.data.products.advanced }} cluster in the same organization. Incompatible versions cannot be selected. By default, the option shows the current cluster. The dropdown displays options to restore to a different cluster.

    Select the **Skip localities check** box if you want to skip checking localities of a cluster before a restore when there are mismatched cluster regions between the backup's cluster and the destination cluster.

1. Click **Continue**.

1. Enter the name of the destination cluster.

1. Once you have reviewed the restore details, click **Restore**.

    The [**Restore Jobs** tab](#restore-jobs) will show you the status of your restore and update when the restore job has been created successfully.

#### Restore a database

To restore a database:

1. On the **Backups** tab, find the cluster backup containing the database you want to restore, and click the number in the corresponding **Databases** column.
1. In the **Databases** view, click **Restore** for the database you want to restore.

    The **Restore database** module displays with backup details.

1. In the **Restore to** fields:
    - Select the name of the destination cluster.
    - Type the name of the destination database.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Resolve any naming conflicts by using [`DROP`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/drop-database.md %}) or [`RENAME`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/alter-database.md %}#rename-to) on the existing database. If you enter a unique name in the **Restore to** field, a new database will be created.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Select any of the **Dependency options** to skip. You can:
    - **Skip missing foreign keys**, which will remove missing [foreign key]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/foreign-key.md %}) constraints (i.e., when the referenced table is not in the backup or is not being restored) before restoring.
    - **Skip missing sequences**, which will ignore [sequence]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/show-sequences.md %}) dependencies (i.e., the `DEFAULT` expression that uses the sequence).
    - **Skip missing views**, which will skip restoring [views]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/views.md %}) that cannot be restored because their dependencies are not being restored at the same time.
    - **Skip localities check**, which will skip checking localities of a cluster before a restore when there are mismatched cluster regions between the backup's cluster and the destination cluster.

1. Click **Continue**.
1. Once you have reviewed the restore details, click **Restore**.

    When the restore job has been created successfully, you will be taken to the [**Restore Jobs** tab](#restore-jobs), which will show you the status of your restore.

When the restore is complete, be sure to set any database-specific [zone configurations]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/configure-replication-zones.md %}) and, if applicable, [grant privileges]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/grant.md %}).

#### Restore a table

To restore a table:

1. Find the cluster backup containing the table you want to restore, and click the number in the corresponding **Databases** column.
1. In the **Databases** view, find the database containing the table you want to restore, and click the number in the corresponding **Tables** column.

    The **Tables** view displays.

1. Click **Restore** for the table you want to restore.

    The **Restore table** module displays with backup details.

1. In the **Restore to** fields:
    - Select the name of the destination cluster.
    - Type the name of the destination database. (Before restoring, ensure that you do not have an existing table with the same name.)

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    If you enter the name of an existing database, the table will be restored into that existing database. To use the name of an existing database, first resolve any naming conflicts with existing tables by using [`DROP`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/drop-table.md %}) or [`RENAME`]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/alter-table.md %}#rename-to) on the table. If you enter a unique name in the **Restore to** field, a new database will be created.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Select any of the **Dependency options** to skip. You can:
    - **Skip missing foreign keys**, which will remove missing [foreign key]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/foreign-key.md %}) constraints (i.e., when the referenced table is not in the backup or is not being restored) before restoring.
    - **Skip missing sequences**, which will ignore [sequence]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/show-sequences.md %}) dependencies (i.e., the `DEFAULT` expression that uses the sequence).
    - **Skip missing views**, which will skip restoring [views]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/views.md %}) that cannot be restored because their dependencies are not being restored at the same time.

1. Click **Continue**.
1. Once you have reviewed the restore details, click **Restore**.

   When the restore job has been created successfully, you will be taken to the [**Restore Jobs** tab](#restore-jobs), which will show you the status of your restore.

For each restore job, the tab will display:

- **Source > Destination**: The source cluster, database, or table to the destination cluster, database, or table.
- **Restore type**: Whether the job is a cluster, database, table restore.
- **Backup taken on**: The date the backup was originally taken.
- **Status**: The status of the restore job `Preparing`, `Running`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`.
- **Restore start**: The date the restore job was initiated.
- **Restore end**: The date the restore job ened (whether successful or unsuccessful).
- **Job ID**: The job ID of the restore job.
