{% include cockroachcloud/filter-tabs/managed-backups.md %}

This page describes managed backups in {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters. You can configure the following:

- The [frequency](#frequency) of the backups to meet [recovery point objective (RPO)]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/disaster-recovery-overview.md %}) requirements.
- The [retention](#retention) of the backups to set how long Cockroach Labs retains the backups.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
In addition to managed backups, you can take manual backups to your own storage bucket with self-managed backups. Refer to the [Take and Restore Self-Managed Backups]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}) page.

## Managed backup settings

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Configurable managed backup settings are available in all [supported versions]({% link releases/release-support-policy.md %}#supported-versions) of CockroachDB on {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters take a combination of full and incremental backups in order to meet the set frequency. The type of managed backup the cluster takes is **not** configurable. Each incremental backup is dependent on the last full backup, which has an effect on the managed backups that you can restore in the set retention period.

Full backups in the cluster will be deleted when they reach the set retention period. At this point, any incremental backups dependent on the deleted full backup will also be deleted. The Cloud Console will not list any backups that are beyond the set retention period, or incremental backups that cannot be restored.

For instructions on how to view and configure managed backup settings, use one of the following:

- [Cloud Console](#cloud-console).
- [Cloud API](#cloud-api).
- [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Terraform provider](#cockroachdb-cloud-terraform-provider).

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/full-backup-setting-change.md %}

### Frequency

You can configure how frequently Cockroach Labs takes backups, which will determine the cluster's [RPO]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/disaster-recovery-overview.md %}).

You can set backup frequency to one of the following options:

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/frequency-settings.md %}

### Retention

You can set your retention duration **once**. After you have adjusted the retention, the duration will only apply to new backups. The available retention options are:

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/retention-settings.md %}

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/retention-deleted-cluster.md %}

## Upgrades and downgrades

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/managed-backup-upgrade-downgrade.md %}

## Considerations

- Every backup will be stored entirely in a single region, which is chosen at random from the list of cluster regions at the time of cluster creation. This region will be used indefinitely to store backups.
- You can perform a cross-cluster restore across {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters that belong to the same organization. However, this cross-cluster restore is not supported for {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.basic }} clusters.
- You cannot restore a backup of a multi-region database into a single-region database.
- For details on managed backups and enabling CMEK in {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters, refer to [Backup and restore operations on a cluster with CMEK]({% link cockroachcloud/cmek.md %}#backup-and-restore-operations-on-a-cluster-with-cmek).

## Cloud Console

### View backups

Click on **Backup and Restore** in the **Data section** of the left-side navigation to access the **Backup Recovery** page.

This page displays a list of your cluster backups. Use the calendar drop-down to view all backups taken on a certain date.

For each backup, the following details display:

- **Data From**: The date and time the backup was taken.
- **Status**: The backup's status, `In Progress` or `Complete`.
- **Expires In**: The remaining number of days Cockroach Labs will [retain](#retention) the backup.
- **Restore**: Restore a particular cluster backup, click **Restore** in the corresponding row.

### Modify backup settings

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
{% include cockroachcloud/backups/full-backup-setting-change.md %}
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/review-settings.md %}

Click on **Settings** and the **Backup Settings** module will open.

The **Enable backups** switch allows you to enable or disable backups.

To modify the [frequency](#frequency) of backups, click on the dropdown under **Schedule backups every**. This will display the following options to select:

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/frequency-settings.md %}

To modify the [retention](#retention) of backups, click on **Retain backups for**. This will display the following options to select:

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/retention-settings.md %}

### Restore a cluster

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The restore completely erases all data in the destination cluster. All cluster data is replaced with the data from the backup. The destination cluster will be unavailable while the job is in progress.

This operation is disruptive and is to be performed with caution. Use the [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) as a golden rule when designing your system of privilege grants.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Performing a restore will cause your cluster to be unavailable for the duration of the restore. All current data is deleted, and the cluster will be restored to the state it was in at the time of the backup.

To restore a cluster:

1. Find the cluster backup on the **Backup Recovery** page.
1. Click **Restore** for the cluster you want to restore.

    The **Restore cluster** module displays with backup details.

1. You can restore a backup to the same cluster.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    If you need to restore data into a new or different cluster, use [self-managed backups]({% link cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-self-managed-backups.md %}) or [contact support]({% link {{site.current_cloud_version}}/support-resources.md %}).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

1. Click **Restore**.

## Cloud API

{% include cockroachcloud/backups/cloud-api-get-put.md %}

## CockroachDB Cloud Terraform provider

You can use the [CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Terraform provider]({% link cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform.md %}) to specify managed backup settings in {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters.

In your `main.tf` Terraform configuration file, use the `backup_config` attribute on the `cockroach_cluster` resource to modify the settings of managed backups. For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ hcl
resource "cockroach_cluster" "standard" {
  name           = "cockroach-standard"
  cloud_provider = "GCP"
  plan           = "STANDARD"
  serverless = {
    usage_limits = {
      provisioned_virtual_cpus = 2
    }
    upgrade_type = "AUTOMATIC"
  }
  regions = [
    {
      name = "us-east1"
    }
  ]
  delete_protection = false
  backup_config = {
    enabled           = true
    frequency_minutes = 60
    retention_days    = 30
  }
}
~~~
