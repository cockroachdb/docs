This page describes how major-version and patch upgrades work and shows how to upgrade a cluster in CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }}. To upgrade a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} cluster, refer to [Upgrade to {{ site.current_cloud_version }}]({% link {{ site.current_cloud_version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}) instead.

## Overview

### Availability during an upgrade

For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.standard }} and {{ site.data.products.basic }}, a cluster remains available during an upgrade.

For CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }}, nodes are upgraded one at a time in a rolling fashion. Multi-node clusters will remain available during the upgrade, but will have reduced capacity as each node restarts. Single-node clusters will be unavailable while the node restarts.

### Upgrades and maintenance windows

If you have [configured a maintenance window]({% link cockroachcloud/advanced-cluster-management.md %}) for a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} cluster, automatic patch upgrades are applied during the maintenance window. Major-version upgrades must be initiated manually.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Maintenance operations that are critical for cluster security or stability may be applied outside of the maintenance window, and upgrades that begin in a maintenance window may not always be completed by the end of the window.

For more information, refer to the [Cloud Upgrade Policy]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}).
