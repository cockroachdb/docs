## View Credits balance

If your organization has an annual contract with CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }}, the **Overview** tab of the **Billing** page displays the amount of available CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Credits you have remaining and the average number of Credits your organization consumes per day. At the end of each billing period, invoice payments are deducted from your organization's Credits.

Under the **Credits** section, you can see more information about each of your organization's contracts. Contracts are listed in the order in which they will be used.

The **Current billing period** section displays a table listing your organization's clusters and the Credits they have accrued. The table also includes the cluster type and associated [labels]({% link cockroachcloud/labels.md %}).

## View invoices
 
You can review an in-progress invoice for the current billing period on the **Overview** tab of the **Billing** page. You can view all of your organization's past invoices on the **Invoices** tab of the **Billing** page. Click any invoice to view the details of your charges for a billing period.

If you're using [folders]({% link cockroachcloud/folders.md %}) to organize your clusters, billing is grouped by folder. Click any folder to view invoices for individual clusters in the folder or its descendants. Within a folder, click any subfolder to view its details.

You can also use the Cloud API to [get invoices for an organization]({% link cockroachcloud/cloud-api.md %}#get-invoices-for-an-organization).

### Export invoices

You can export invoice data in CSV or PDF format. From the **Invoices** tab, on the row of any billing period, click the **...** button under the **Download** column and select **Export CSV** or **Export PDF**.

- The CSV file includes line items for all clusters in your organization for the selected billing period. It includes the same information that is available when viewing invoices within the Console.
