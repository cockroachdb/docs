CockroachDB v24.2 is an optional [Innovation release]({% link releases/release-support-policy.md %}#support-types).

Regular releases are produced twice a year, alternating with Innovation releases. They are supported for one year. Upgrading CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} directly from one regular release to the next regular release, skipping the intervening Innovation release, is supported.
  - [Innovation releases]({% link cockroachcloud/upgrade-policy.md %}#innovation-releases) are optional and can be skipped for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} but are required for CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }}. Innovation releases are produced twice a year, alternating with Regular releases. An innovation release is supported for 6 months, at which time a CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster must be upgraded to the next Regular release. At a a given time, only one Innovation release is typically supported. Upgrading CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} directly from one Innovation release to the next innovation release is not supported.

- Previously, a default setting in the Amazon CloudWatch exporter could cause redundant cardinality in [metrics exported](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/export-metrics) from CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters, which unnecessarily increased costs. This option is now disabled to reduce AWS costs.

<h3 id="2023-07-10-console-changes"> Console changes </h3>

- The **Add database** button on the [**Databases** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/databases-page) of the Console is temporarily disabled.
- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} [restore jobs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups?filters=dedicated#ways-to-restore-data) now have the following more descriptive statuses: `Preparing`, `Running`, `Reverting`, `Finalizing`, `Succeeded`, and `Failed` statuses. Additionally, destination clusters of self-service restores now display a `Restoring` state during the restore.
- The [**Databases** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/databases-page) now includes additional statistics for clusters running [v23.1.0]({% link releases/v23.1.md %}) and later.
- You can now set up an AWS CloudWatch integration and view its status directly from the [**Tools** page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/tools-page) of the CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} Console.

<h3 id="2023-07-10-security-changes"> Security updates </h3>

- The `status` returned by the [`logexport` Cloud API endpoint](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/export-logs#the-logexport-endpoint) is now determined by the state of both the latest log export's job state and the readiness of the underlying logging resources. Before this change, a `GET` request to the `logexport` endpoint could report an outdated log export status that conflicted with the latest log export update job state or with the most recent state of the logging infrastructure.
- Fixed a bug where concurrent [restores](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups#restore-a-cluster) could run on the same destination cluster and cause the destination cluster to become unusable.

- All resources are available instantly at the beginning of each month (burst and baseline RUs are now deprecated).
- You can now [set separate RU and storage limits](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management#edit-your-resource-limits) for your clusters, or set a spend limit that will be divided between resources automatically.
- You can now [set unlimited resources](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/serverless-cluster-management#edit-your-resource-limits) for a cluster so your workload is never restricted.
- Organizations on the free plan will have at most one free serverless cluster (instead of the previous limit of five free clusters). **Cockroach Labs will continue to maintain all existing free clusters with the new organization-level free resources**.
- Organizations can now create 200 serverless clusters instead of the previous maximum of five total clusters.

For an in-depth explanation of CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} pricing, refer to [Pricing](https://cockroachlabs.com/pricing). For any questions or concerns, please [contact Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com).

- [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) responses now contain a header called `Cc-Trace-Id` that can be provided to [Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com) to help with diagnostics or troubleshooting.
- The `CreateCluster` and `UpdateCluster` methods now support setting individual monthly limits for a cluster's [Request Units](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/architecture#request-unit-ru) and [storage](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/architecture#storage) usage.
- If your organization is enrolled in the new fine-grained authorization model described under **Security Updates**, you can assign the [new roles](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) to both users and service accounts using the [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) or [Terraform provider](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform) in addition to the {{ site.data.products.Cloud }} Console.

<h3 id="2023-05-01-security-changes"> Security updates </h3>

- CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.cloud }} is transitioning to a new [authorization model](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#overview-of-the-cockroachdb-cloud-two-level-authorization-model) that offers fine-grained access-control (FGAC), meaning that users can be given access to exactly the actions and resources required to perform their tasks. Changes include [cluster-level roles](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) and consistent access management across users and service accounts. This feature is in [limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability), and you can enroll your organization by contacting your account team. For more information, see [Managing Access (Authorization) in CockroachDB Cloud](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/managing-access).

- You can now use client certificates to authenticate to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters. First, a [cluster administrator](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/authorization#organization-user-roles) needs to upload a CA certificate for the cluster using the [Cloud API](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/cloud-api) or [Terraform provider](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/provision-a-cluster-with-terraform). After that, individual users can be assigned client certificates signed by the uploaded CA certificate, which they can then use to connect to the cluster. This feature is in [limited access](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/{{site.current_cloud_version}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability), and you can enroll your organization by contacting your account team.
