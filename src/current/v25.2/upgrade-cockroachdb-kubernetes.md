This page shows how to upgrade a CockroachDB cluster that is [deployed on a Kubernetes cluster]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/deploy-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.md %}).

## Overview

On Kubernetes, the upgrade is a [staged update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#staging-an-update) in which each pod's container image for CockroachDB is updated in a rolling fashion. The cluster remains available during the upgrade.

Select the cluster's deployment method to continue.
