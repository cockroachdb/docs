This page provides practical guidance on identifying common [hotspots]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}) in CockroachDB clusters, using real-time monitoring and historical logs.

## Signals to monitor

To identify a [hotspot]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}), monitor the following graphs on the [DB Console **Metrics** page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}#metrics), as well as the following metrics on the [DB Console **Advanced Debug Custom Chart** page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.md %}).

### 1. CPU percent

- On the DB Console **Metrics** page **Hardware** dashboard, monitor the [**CPU Percent** graph]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-hardware-dashboard.md %}#cpu-percent).
- CPU usage increases proportionally with traffic.
- If the CPU usage of the hottest node is 20% or more above the cluster average, it may indicate a potential [index hotspot](#index-hotspot) or [row hotspot (hot by read)](#row-hotspot-hot-by-read). Note the ID of the [hot node]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#hot-node).
- For example, node `n5`, represented by the green line in the following **CPU Percent** graph, hovers at around 87% at time 17:35 compared to other nodes that hover around 20% to 25%.

### 2. Runnable Goroutines per CPU

- On the DB Console **Metrics** page **Runtime** dashboard, monitor the [**Runnable Goroutines Per CPU** graph]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-runtime-dashboard.md %}#runnable-goroutines-per-cpu).
- A significant difference between the average and maximum values may indicate a potential [index hotspot](#index-hotspot) or [row hotspot (hot by read)](#row-hotspot-hot-by-read).  Note the ID of the [hot node]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#hot-node).
- Nodes typically hover near `0.0`, unless a node is at or near its system-configured limit of 32.
- The **Runnable Goroutines per CPU** graph rises more sharply than the [**CPU Percent** graph](#1-cpu-percent). The goroutines graph only jumps up when a node approaches its limit, and then rises sharply. The following image shows the general shapes of the two graphs.

- For example, node `n5`, represented by the green line in the following **Runnable Goroutine per CPU** graph, hovers above 3 at 17:35, compared to other nodes hovering around 0.0.

### 3. KV Execution Latency

- On the DB Console **Metrics** page **SQL** dashboard, monitor the [**KV Execution Latency: 90th percentile** graph]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-sql-dashboard.md %}#kv-execution-latency-90th-percentile).
- A maximum value that is a clear outlier in the cluster may indicate a potential [row hotspot (hot by write)](#row-hotspot-hot-by-write). Note the ID of the [hot node]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#hot-node).
  
<img src="{{ 'images/v25.2/detect-hotspots-5.png' | relative_url }}" alt="graph of KV Execution Latency: 90th percentile" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

### 4. Latch conflict wait durations

- On the [DB Console **Advanced Debug Custom Chart** page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.md %}), if a virtual cluster dropdown is present in the upper right corner, select `system`.
- Create a custom chart to monitor the `kv.concurrency.latch_conflict_wait_durations-avg` metric, which tracks time spent on [latch acquisition]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/transaction-layer.md %}#latch-manager) waiting for conflicts with other latches. For example, a [sequence]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#hot-sequence) writing to the same row must wait for the latch.
- To display the metric per node, select the `PER NODE/STORE` checkbox. 

<img src="{{ 'images/v25.2/detect-hotspots-6.png' | relative_url }}" alt="kv.concurrency.latch_conflict_wait_durations-avg" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

- A maximum value that is a clear outlier in the cluster may indicate a potential [row hotspot (hot by write)](#row-hotspot-hot-by-write). Note the ID of the [hot node]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#hot-node).

### 5. Clear direction

CockroachDB optimizes performance by splitting frequently accessed keys into smaller ranges. In conjunction with load-based rebalancing, [load-based splitting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/load-based-splitting.md %}) distributes load evenly across your cluster.

- On the [DB Console **Advanced Debug Custom Chart** page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.md %}), if a virtual cluster dropdown is present in the upper right corner, select `system`.
- Create a custom chart to monitor the `kv.loadsplitter.popularkey` metric. This metric tracks whether the [load-based splitter]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/load-based-splitting.md %}) observed an access direction greater than 80% to the left or right in the samples. This indicates that the keys used by a replica increase or decrease steadily in one direction.
- If this metric is non-zero, it may indicate a potential [index hotspot](#index-hotspot).

<img src="{{ 'images/v25.2/detect-hotspots-4.png' | relative_url }}" alt="graph of kv.loadsplitter.cleardirection" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

### 6. Popular key

- On the [DB Console **Advanced Debug Custom Chart** page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.md %}), if a virtual cluster dropdown is present in the upper right corner, select `system`.
- Create a custom chart to monitor the `kv.loadsplitter.popularkey` metric. This metric tracks whether the [load-based splitter]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/load-based-splitting.md %}) could not find a split key, and the most frequently sampled split key appears in over 25% of the samples. In a given replica, one key may receive most of the traffic.
- If this metric significantly increases, it may indicate a potential [row hotspot (hot by read)](#row-hotspot-hot-by-read) or [row hotspot (hot by write)](#row-hotspot-hot-by-write).

## Hotspot type

Once you have checked the graphs described in [Signals to monitor](#signals-to-monitor), identify the type of hotspot occurring in your cluster.

### Index hotspot

If the following combination of graphs indicates a hotspot:

- [1. CPU percent](#1-cpu-percent)
- [2. Runnable Goroutines per CPU](#2-runnable-goroutines-per-cpu)
- [5. Clear direction](#5-clear-direction) 

the hotspot is likely to be an [index hotspot]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#index-hotspot).

### Row hotspot, hot by read

If the following combination of graphs indicates a hotspot:

- [1. CPU percent](#1-cpu-percent)
- [2. Runnable Goroutines per CPU](#2-runnable-goroutines-per-cpu)
- [6. Popular key](#6-popular-key)

the hotspot is likely to be a [row hotspot]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#row-hotspot) that is [hot by read]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#read-hotspot).

### Row hotspot, hot by write

If the following combination of graphs indicates a hotspot:

- [3. KV Execution Latency](#3-kv-execution-latency)
- [4. Latch conflict wait durations](#4-latch-conflict-wait-durations)
- [6. Popular key](#6-popular-key)

the hotspot is likely to be a [row hotspot]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#row-hotspot) that is [hot by write]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#write-hotspot).

## Location of hotspot

Once you have determined the [type of hotspot](#hotspot-type), locate the index or row causing the hotspot using the [Hot Ranges page](#hot-ranges-page) and logs, if applicable.

### Hot Ranges page

Navigate to the DB Console [**Hot Ranges** page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-hot-ranges-page.md %}) to identify the corresponding [hot index](#index-hotspot). For row hotspots—either [hot by read](#row-hotspot-hot-by-read) or [hot by write](#row-hotspot-hot-by-write)—the **Hot Ranges** page can help locate the table and index associated with the affected row.

1. Sort the results by either of the following columns in descending order:
   1.  The **CPU** column that represents CPU time, measured in milliseconds used per second, compared to the [**CPU Percent** graph](#1-cpu-percent) which is percent usage. The per-second rate is averaged over the last 30 minutes.
   1.  The **Write (bytes)** column that represents the total number of bytes written per second on this range. The per-second rate is averaged over the last 30 minutes.
1. Correlate the node ID listed in the **Leaseholder** column with the suspected node noted from the [signal graphs](#signals-to-monitor).
1. If a correlation is found:
  1. Note the range in the **Range ID** column.
  1. Scroll to the right side of the page to find the Table and Index columns, which identify the table and index associated with that range ID.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Focus on correlating spikes in the **CPU Percent** or **Runnable Goroutines per CPU** graphs with specific index usage to confirm the index hotspot.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Once you have determined the table and index, run the SQL statement [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-create.md %}#show-the-create-table-statement-for-a-table) to inspect the schema for the identified table and index.


### `hot_ranges_stats` logs

Under certain circumstances, an event of type [hot_ranges_stats]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/eventlog.md %}#hot_ranges_stats) will be emitted for a [hot range]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/understand-hotspots.md %}#hot-range). While the [**Hot Ranges** page](#hot-ranges-page) contains real-time information for all the nodes of the cluster, the `hot_ranges_stats` logs contain historical information only for the given node. This event type is logged to the [`HEALTH` channel]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/logging.md %}#health).

### Clear direction logs

The clear direction log is not connected to an event, but has an unstructured message similar to this:

```
access balance between left and right for sampled keys: left-biased 85%
```

### Popular key logs

The popular key log is not connected to an event, but has an unstructured message similar to this:

```
no split key found: insufficient counters = 6, imbalance = 14, most popular key occurs in 46% of samples
```

## Performance Benchmarks and Limitations

During internal testing (row sizes 256–512 bytes) on an **N2-standard-16** machine:

| Category               | Performance Limit          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Index Hotspot          | ~22,000 inserts per second  |
| Row Hotspot (Writes)   | ~1,000 writes per second    |
| Row Hotspot (Reads)    | ~70,000 reads per second    |

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The larger the cluster, the easier it is to detect hotspots due to clearer outliers.
