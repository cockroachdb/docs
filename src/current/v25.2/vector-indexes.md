{% include_cached new-in.html version="v25.2" %} A *vector index* enables efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search on high-dimensional [`VECTOR`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/vector.md %}) columns. Use vector indexes to improve the performance of similarity searches over large datasets, such as embeddings generated by machine learning models.

This page describes how to create and use vector indexes on CockroachDB.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`VECTOR` functionality is compatible with the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension for PostgreSQL.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## How do vector indexes work?

CockroachDB vector indexes organize [vectors]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/vector.md %}) into a hierarchical structure of partitions using [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). This partition structure groups similar vectors together and enables efficient, [tunable](#tune-vector-indexes) ANN searches.

When a query uses a vector index, CockroachDB explores a subset of partitions based on their proximity to the query vector. It then retrieves and evaluates a candidate set of vectors using the [configured distance metric](#comparisons) and returns the top nearest results.

## Enable vector indexes

To enable the use of vector indexes, set the `feature.vector_index.enabled` [cluster setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cluster-settings.md %}#setting-feature-vector-index-enabled):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING feature.vector_index.enabled = true;
~~~

To enable the creation of vector indexes on non-empty tables, also disable the `sql_safe_updates` [session setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/session-variables.md %}#sql-safe-updates). This allows vector indexes to be backfilled on existing rows, during which **table writes are blocked** to ensure vector index consistency. This blocking behavior is a [known limitation](#known-limitations) that is currently being tracked.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Adding a vector index to a non-empty table can temporarily disrupt workloads that perform continuous writes.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET sql_safe_updates = false;
~~~

## Create vector indexes

To create a vector index, use the [`CREATE VECTOR INDEX`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-index.md %}) statement:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ON {table} (column});
~~~

You can also specify a vector index during table creation. For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    department_id INT,
    category_id INT,
    embedding VECTOR(1536),
    VECTOR INDEX (embedding)
);
~~~

### Define prefix columns

You can create a vector index with one or more *prefix columns* to pre-filter the search space. This is especially useful for tables containing millions of vectors or more. 

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    department_id INT,
    category_id INT,
    embedding VECTOR(1536),
    VECTOR INDEX (department_id, category_id, embedding)
);
~~~

A vector index is only used if each prefix column is constrained to a specific value in the query. For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
WHERE department_id = 100 AND category_id = 200
~~~

You can filter on multiple prefix values using `IN`:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
WHERE (department_id, category_id) IN ((100, 200), (300, 400))
~~~

The following example will not use the vector index:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
WHERE department_id = 100 AND category_id >= 200
~~~

For an example, refer to [Create and query a vector index](#create-and-query-a-vector-index).

### Specify an opclass

You can optionally specify an opclass. If not specified, the default is `vector_l2_ops`:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE TABLE items (
    department_id INT,
    category_id INT,
    embedding VECTOR(1536),
    VECTOR INDEX embed_idx (embedding vector_l2_ops)
);
~~~

## Comparisons

Vector indexes on `VECTOR` columns support the following comparison operator:

- **L2 distance**: [`<->`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/functions-and-operators.md %}#operators)

For usage, refer to the [Example](#example).

## Tune vector indexes

The following vector index parameters are tunable:

- Search beam size, using `vector_search_beam_size`
- Partition size, using `min_partition_size` and `max_partition_size`
- Build beam size, using `build_beam_size` (not recommended)

For guidelines on how these parameters affect search accuracy and write performance, refer to [Tuning considerations](#tuning-considerations).

Set the following storage parameters when you create a vector index:

- `min_partition_size`: Minimum number of vectors in a partition before it is merged with another partition. This value must be greater than or equal to `1`, up to a maximum of `1024`. The default value is `16`.
- `max_partition_size`: Maximum number of vectors in a partition before it is split into smaller partitions. This must be at least 4 times the value of `min_partition_size`, up to a maximum of `4096`. The default value is `128`.
- `build_beam_size`: Beam size for index build (how many branches of the k-means tree are explored when assigning a vector to a partition). The default value is `8`. Cockroach Labs does not recommend changing this setting. It is more effective to increase `vector_search_beam_size`.

For example, the following statement creates a vector index with a custom partition size:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ON items (category, embedding) WITH (min_partition_size=16, max_partition_size=128);
~~~

Set the [`vector_search_beam_size` session setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/session-variables.md %}#vector-search-beam-size) to determine how many vector partitions will be considered during query execution. The default value is `32`, which represents the number of partitions that are explored at each level of the k-means tree.

For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET vector_search_beam_size = 16;
~~~

### Tuning considerations

Partition size and beam size interact to control both the precision of nearest neighbor search and the cost of maintaining the index. You can improve the accuracy of vector searches by increasing either the search beam size or partition size:

- A larger search beam improves accuracy by exploring more partitions, which increases the number of candidate vectors evaluated.

- A larger partition size improves accuracy by placing more vectors in each partition, which increases the number of candidate vectors retrieved for a given beam size. It also improves write performance by reducing the frequency of partition splits and merges.

In both cases, read latency and CPU usage increase with size.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Changing `build_beam_size` offers little to no practical benefit compared to adjusting `vector_search_beam_size`. In most cases, tuning `build_beam_size` will not yield meaningful accuracy improvements and can negatively impact index construction performance.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Search accuracy

To explore more partitions during a search, increase `vector_search_beam_size`. This improves search accuracy by evaluating more of the index, but increases CPU usage and read latency because more partitions are scanned.

To group more vectors into each partition, increase the partition size with `min_partition_size` and `max_partition_size`. This improves search accuracy by causing more candidate vectors to be evaluated per partition. However, it increases CPU usage and increases read latency because each partition contains more vectors. For the same reason, you can often reduce `vector_search_beam_size` without sacrificing accuracy.

Search accuracy is highly dependent on workload factors such as partition size, the number of `VECTOR` dimensions, how well the embeddings reflect semantic similarity, and how vectors are distributed in the dataset. Experiment with `vector_search_beam_size`, `min_partition_size`, and `max_partition_size` on a representative dataset to find the optimal setting for your workload.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
You can improve search accuracy for filtered queries by creating a [vector index with a prefix column](#create-and-query-a-vector-index).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Write performance

Because a larger partition size leads to fewer partition splits and merges, it enables faster insert performance.

To optimize writes, increase the partition size with `min_partition_size` and `max_partition_size`. A larger partition size leads to fewer partition splits and merges, resulting in faster insert performance.

## Example

In the following example, a vector index with a prefix column is used to optimize searches on a `VECTOR` column in 512 dimensions. The example table is populated with 156,541 example rows, using a Python script to quickly insert the vectors.

### Before you begin

- Create a virtual `python3` environment and install `psycopg[binary]`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    python3 -m venv ~/venv
    source ~/venv/bin/activate
    pip install psycopg[binary]
    ~~~

- Download the Python script and sample data:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    curl -O https://vector-examples.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fast_insert.py
    curl -O https://vector-examples.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/clip_embeddings_with_customers.csv
    ~~~

    Ensure that the `.py` and `.csv` files are located in the same directory.

### Create and query a vector index

1. Start a single-node cluster:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach start-single-node \
    --insecure \
    --listen-addr=localhost:26257 \
    --http-addr=localhost:8080
    ~~~

1. In a separate terminal, open a SQL shell on the cluster:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    cockroach sql --insecure
    ~~~

1. [Enable vector indexes](#enable-vector-indexes) on the cluster:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SET CLUSTER SETTING feature.vector_index.enabled = true;
    ~~~

1. Create an `items` table that includes a `VECTOR` column called `embedding`, along with a vector index that uses `customer_id` as the prefix column:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    CREATE TABLE items (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
        customer_id INT NOT NULL,
        name TEXT,
        embedding VECTOR(512),
        VECTOR INDEX (customer_id, embedding)
    );
    ~~~

1. In another terminal, run the Python script to insert the `clip_embeddings_with_customers.csv` data into the `items` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    python fast_insert.py
    ~~~

    This process should take approximately 5-10 minutes.

1. When the script is finished executing, verify that `items` is populated:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      schema_name | table_name | type  | owner | estimated_row_count | locality
    --------------+------------+-------+-------+---------------------+-----------
      public      | items      | table | root  |              156541 | NULL
    ~~~

1. Perform a vector search using the `<->` L2 distance [operator](#comparisons). Include the `WHERE` clause to query only the vectors associated with a given `customer_id`, thus narrowing the vector search space:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SELECT id, name, embedding
    FROM items
    WHERE customer_id = 1
    ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.00644,-0.00866,-0.00977,0.02129,0.02191,-0.02144,-0.01439,-0.08154,-0.0587,0.06555,-0.00967,0.00842,0.02094,-0.02939,0.0192,-0.007866,-0.10443,0.0015745,-0.0217,-0.02982,-0.08563,-0.02203,0.0501,-0.003183,-0.01802,0.0655,0.01355,0.01678,-0.03091,-0.02046,0.01982,0.01646,0.01002,-0.0065,0.01979,0.004524,0.01073,-0.05038,-0.03114,-0.101,-0.04953,-0.02039,-0.023,-0.02094,-0.00508,0.0516,0.04684,0.04715,-0.0394,-0.007435,0.01808,-0.0278,0.05685,0.0329,0.00896,0.010826,-0.005516,-0.010315,-0.02145,0.02296,0.1049,-0.005733,0.03433,0.001492,0.02802,-0.0556,0.006145,0.1013,0.0001343,-0.03726,-0.006786,0.00227,-0.04358,0.04694,0.03943,0.03278,-0.0363,-0.01343,-0.03497,-0.0328,0.01595,0.05524,-0.01823,0.001669,-0.00695,0.02367,0.01013,0.002083,0.01569,-0.02184,0.02864,0.01169,-0.601,0.02724,0.02263,-0.02649,-0.0441,0.00481,-0.03882,0.03064,0.01927,0.03833,-0.010216,0.004444,0.00893,0.0193,0.03137,0.03958,0.01245,0.02023,0.02443,-0.0112,-0.0187,-0.03604,0.004948,-0.01305,-0.03836,0.02914,0.01202,-0.00994,0.0363,-0.02258,0.001203,-0.00885,-0.01624,-0.0581,0.0009136,-0.003847,-0.0367,0.02737,0.00599,-0.0483,-0.0118,0.0759,0.00767,0.003883,0.03516,0.02686,-0.03726,-0.00888,-0.01439,0.001924,-0.01883,0.002098,0.008156,0.02428,0.00918,0.0635,-0.0732,0.02007,-0.04968,-0.007645,0.0289,0.02925,0.0748,-0.01974,-0.005478,0.01422,-0.00888,0.00675,-0.0424,-0.0303,0.04932,0.02055,0.02792,0.0472,-0.003717,0.002607,-0.02156,-0.01054,0.01159,0.004093,0.0001816,-0.01353,-0.01317,-0.05783,-0.03,0.01709,-0.01575,0.0304,0.02939,-0.01793,0.00964,0.0189,-0.01825,0.01331,-0.00656,-0.04044,-0.02902,-0.01347,0.004368,0.001875,0.005116,0.01038,-0.00973,0.002888,0.000518,0.02673,0.0642,-0.03763,-0.02138,-0.0416,0.00846,-0.02809,0.0316,0.001358,-0.02815,-0.001282,-0.01662,0.02885,-0.05585,0.01015,-0.001081,0.03366,0.013054,-0.001288,-0.003696,0.0241,0.0399,-0.00688,-0.0214,0.05804,-0.02957,0.001987,-0.05627,0.02072,-0.01066,-0.03433,0.01738,0.009476,-0.04984,-0.01028,-0.01958,-0.01398,-0.002432,-0.007023,0.00878,-0.01415,-0.007385,0.0034,0.01254,0.01034,0.00281,-0.01055,-0.03906,0.1171,0.00905,0.04788,-0.0153,0.0007515,-0.02356,0.02296,-0.01756,0.02966,-0.011826,-0.005955,0.01316,0.02348,0.163,-0.01337,0.04013,0.02695,-0.067,-0.01836,-0.01407,-0.03992,-0.02078,-0.03387,-0.009224,-0.02885,-0.0403,0.01034,-0.01936,-0.05518,0.01933,-0.02551,-0.01865,0.011566,0.004776,-0.006454,-0.00337,0.0293,-0.04312,0.02434,-0.01068,0.0129,0.1411,-0.009705,0.00439,0.007706,-0.01176,0.002438,0.01431,0.000449,-0.0555,-0.01441,-0.10535,-0.02295,-0.01897,0.010284,-0.012115,0.001859,0.03467,0.03192,0.001146,-0.02293,-0.02399,-0.005974,-0.010124,-0.0008497,-0.000651,0.01846,0.0758,-0.0278,0.006382,0.03943,0.01388,0.05035,0.01521,0.06116,0.03442,-0.01788,-0.0569,0.006584,0.01228,0.01238,-0.03021,-0.01166,-0.006516,-0.008354,-0.02957,-0.02144,0.03128,0.03708,-0.01941,0.010666,-0.001733,-0.01843,0.046,-0.002312,0.00544,-0.03162,-0.02313,0.03387,0.02907,-0.00806,0.007584,-0.005272,0.001955,0.01826,0.08746,0.00287,0.06085,-0.029,-0.002197,-0.1055,-0.0318,0.189,0.02068,-0.02332,0.009674,-0.02429,-0.01633,-0.00488,-0.0756,0.01032,0.06146,-0.0911,-0.02176,0.03766,-0.01198,0.063,-0.014595,-0.01846,-0.00856,0.02599,0.0907,-0.01367,0.0222,-0.02231,-0.0008545,0.0555,-5.585e-05,0.005394,0.02129,0.011,0.02121,-0.01152,-0.00693,0.1929,-0.01228,0.02162,0.01978,0.01041,0.02802,-0.02838,0.04248,0.02315,0.1019,-0.01604,-0.00924,0.01413,-0.02165,-0.02916,0.010605,-0.04526,-0.0052,-0.06186,-0.00414,0.02492,0.0158,0.01962,-0.010445,0.006237,-0.0173,0.000725,-0.04904,0.00871,0.02087,0.007633,0.04895,-0.01091,0.03452,0.05344,-0.03525,0.0241,-0.03035,-0.0248,0.1195,-0.005257,-0.02145,-0.004898,0.06647,0.0414,-0.02187,0.00893,0.01549,0.002043,-0.01074,0.00422,0.01991,0.04913,0.04034,0.00208,0.01962,-0.02525,-0.03244,-0.0376,-0.03757,0.003544,0.01556,0.0317,-0.05896,0.01587,0.03357,-0.0199,0.02716,-0.03397,0.02982,0.05362,0.0505,-0.0003583,0.00599,0.01162,0.014046,-0.01706,-0.0169,0.0216,-0.006832,0.04095,-0.01227,0.00589,0.01863,-0.00428,0.00327,0.00678,-0.02963,-0.012665,0.05237,-0.02408,0.0238,-0.02515,-0.01116,0.00577,-0.00711,0.05258,0.003374,0.04153,0.01464,-0.01508,-0.03598,-0.01016,0.0322,-0.0585,0.005238,-0.02141,-0.001159,0.010124,-0.02986,-0.02534,-0.005997,0.004307,-0.02657,0.01692,-0.03638,-0.05765,-0.03622,0.003136,-0.0616,0.07184,-0.006992,-0.007393]'
