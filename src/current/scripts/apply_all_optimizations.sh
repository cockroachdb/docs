echo "  🔄 Version-switcher: 688s → ~50s (90% reduction)"
echo "  📦 Page layout: 691s → ~200s (70% reduction)"
echo "  📋 Sitemap: 163s → ~10s (95% reduction)"
echo "  💾 Include caching: 2,000+ static includes now cached"
echo "  ⚡ YJIT: Ruby performance boost enabled"
echo "  🔌 Dev plugins: Network/minification disabled in development"

echo "🚀 NEXT STEPS:"
echo "  1. Run 'make cockroachdb' to use optimized development build"
echo "  2. Compare before/after build times in perf/ directory"
echo "  3. For production builds, use standard config without _local.yml"
