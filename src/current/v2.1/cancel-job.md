title: CANCEL JOB
summary: The CANCEL JOB statement stops long-running jobs such as imports, backups, and schema changes.
toc: true
---

The `CANCEL JOB` [statement](sql-statements.html) lets you stop long-running jobs, which include [`IMPORT`](import.html) jobs, enterprise [`BACKUP`](backup.html) and [`RESTORE`](restore.html) jobs, and as of v2.1, schema changes and [changefeeds](change-data-capture.html).


## Limitations

When an enterprise [`RESTORE`](restore.html) is canceled, partially restored data is properly cleaned up. This can have a minor, temporary impact on cluster performance.

## Required privileges

Only members of the `admin` role can cancel a job. By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.

## Synopsis

<div>
  {% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/diagrams/cancel_job.html %}
</div>

## Parameters

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
`job_id` | The ID of the job you want to cancel, which can be found with [`SHOW JOBS`](show-jobs.html).
`select_stmt` | A [selection query](selection-queries.html) that returns `job_id`(s) to cancel.

## Examples

### Cancel a single job

~~~ sql
> SHOW JOBS;
~~~
~~~
+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
|       id       |  type   |               description                 |...
+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
| 27536791415282 | RESTORE | RESTORE db.* FROM 'azure://backup/db/tbl' |...
+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------------+...
~~~
~~~ sql
> CANCEL JOB 27536791415282;
~~~

### Cancel multiple jobs

<span class="version-tag">New in v2.1:</span> To cancel multiple jobs, nest a [`SELECT` clause](select-clause.html) that retrieves `job_id`(s) inside the `CANCEL JOBS` statement:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CANCEL JOBS (SELECT job_id FROM [SHOW JOBS]
      WHERE user_name = 'maxroach');
~~~

All jobs created by `maxroach` will be cancelled.
