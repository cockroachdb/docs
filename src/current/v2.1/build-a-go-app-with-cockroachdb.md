This tutorial shows you how build a simple Go application with CockroachDB using a PostgreSQL-compatible driver or ORM.

We have tested the [Go pq driver](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq) and the [GORM ORM](http://gorm.io) enough to claim **beta-level** support, so those are featured here. If you encounter problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/new) with details to help us make progress toward full support.

## Before you begin

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/before-you-begin.md %}

## Step 1. Install the Go pq driver

To install the [Go pq driver](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq), run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go get -u github.com/lib/pq
~~~

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="secure">

## Step 2. Create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/create-maxroach-user-and-bank-database.md %}

## Step 3. Generate a certificate for the `maxroach` user

Create a certificate and key for the `maxroach` user by running the following command.  The code samples will run as this user.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach cert create-client maxroach --certs-dir=certs --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
~~~

## Step 4. Run the Go code

Now that you have a database and a user, you'll run code to create a table and insert some rows, and then you'll run code to read and update values as an atomic [transaction](transactions.html).

### Basic statements

First, use the following code to connect as the `maxroach` user and execute some basic SQL statements, creating a table, inserting rows, and reading and printing the rows.

Download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/basic-sample.go" download><code>basic-sample.go</code></a> file, or create the file yourself and copy the code into it.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ go
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/app/basic-sample.go %}
~~~

Then run the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go run basic-sample.go
~~~

The output should be:

~~~
Initial balances:
1 1000
2 250
~~~

### Transaction (with retry logic)

Next, use the following code to again connect as the `maxroach` user but this time will execute a batch of statements as an atomic transaction to transfer funds from one account to another, where all included statements are either committed or aborted.

Download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/txn-sample.go" download><code>txn-sample.go</code></a> file, or create the file yourself and copy the code into it.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ go
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/app/txn-sample.go %}
~~~

CockroachDB may require the [client to retry a transaction](transactions.html#transaction-retries) in case of read/write contention. CockroachDB provides a generic **retry function** that runs inside a transaction and retries it as needed. For Go, the CockroachDB retry function is in the `crdb` package of the CockroachDB Go client. To install  Clone the library into your `$GOPATH` as follows:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/cockroachdb
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cockroachdb
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ git clone git@github.com:cockroachdb/cockroach-go.git
~~~

Then run the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go run txn-sample.go
~~~

The output should be:

~~~ shell
Success
~~~

To verify that funds were transferred from one account to another, use the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --certs-dir=certs -e 'SELECT id, balance FROM accounts' --database=bank
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |     900 |
|  2 |     350 |
+----+---------+
(2 rows)
~~~
