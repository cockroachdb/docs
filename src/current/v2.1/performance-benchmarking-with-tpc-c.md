title: Performance Benchmarking with TPC-C
summary: Learn how to benchmark CockroachDB against TPC-C.
toc: true
---

This page walks you through [TPC-C](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) performance benchmarking on CockroachDB. It measures tpmC (new order transactions/minute) on two TPC-C datasets:

- 1,000 warehouses (for a total dataset size of 200GB) on 3 nodes
- 10,000 warehouses (for a total dataset size of 2TB) on 30 nodes

These two points on the spectrum show how CockroachDB scales from modest-sized production workloads to larger-scale deployments. This demonstrates how CockroachDB achieves high OLTP performance of over 128,000 tpmC on a TPC-C dataset over 2TB in size.

## Benchmark a small cluster

### Step 1. Create 3 Google Cloud Platform GCE instances

1. [Create 3 instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance) for your CockroachDB nodes. While creating each instance:  
    - Use the `n1-highcpu-16` machine type.

        For our TPC-C benchmarking, we use `n1-highcpu-16` machines. Currently, we believe this (or higher vCPU count machines) is the best configuration for CockroachDB under high traffic scenarios.
    - [Create and mount a local SSD using a SCSI interface](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#create_local_ssd).

         We attach a single local SSD to each virtual machine. Local SSDs are low latency disks attached to each VM, which maximizes performance. We chose this configuration because it best resembles what a bare metal deployment would look like, with machines directly connected to one physical disk each. We do not recommend using network-attached block storage.
    - [Optimize the local SSD for write performance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#optimize_local_ssd) (see the **Disable write cache flushing** section).
    - To apply the Admin UI firewall rule you created earlier, click **Management, disk, networking, SSH keys**, select the **Networking** tab, and then enter `cockroachdb` in the **Network tags** field.

2. Note the internal IP address of each `n1-highcpu-16` instance. You'll need these addresses when starting the CockroachDB nodes.

3. Create a fourth instance for running the TPC-C benchmark.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
This configuration is intended for performance benchmarking only. For production deployments, there are other important considerations, such as ensuring that data is balanced across at least three availability zones for resiliency. See the [Production Checklist](recommended-production-settings.html) for more details.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Step 2. Start a 3-node cluster

1. SSH to the first `n1-highcpu-16` instance.

2. Download the [CockroachDB archive](https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz) for Linux, extract the binary, and copy it into the `PATH`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz \
    | tar -xz
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cp -i cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/
    ~~~

    If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with `sudo`.

3. Run the [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) command:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --advertise-addr=<node1 internal address> \
    --join=<node1 internal address>,<node2 internal address>,<node3 internal address> \
    --cache=.25 \
    --max-sql-memory=.25 \
    --background
    ~~~

4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for the other two `n1-highcpu-16` instances. Be sure to adjust the `--advertise-addr` flag each time.

5. From the fourth `n1-highcpu-16` instance, run the [`cockroach init`](initialize-a-cluster.html) command:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach init --insecure --host=<address of any node>
    ~~~

    Each node then prints helpful details to the [standard output](start-a-node.html#standard-output), such as the CockroachDB version, the URL for the Web UI, and the SQL URL for clients.

### Step 3. Load data for the benchmark

CockroachDB offers a pre-built `workload` binary for Linux that includes several load generators for simulating client traffic against your cluster. This step features CockroachDB's version of the TPC-C workload.

1. SSH to the fourth instance (the one not running a CockroachDB node), download `workload`, and make it executable:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ wget https://edge-binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach/workload.LATEST ; chmod 755 workload.LATEST
    ~~~

2. Rename and copy `workload` into the `PATH`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cp -i workload.LATEST /usr/local/bin/workload
    ~~~

3. Start the TPC-C workload, pointing it at the [connection string of a node](connection-parameters.html#connect-using-a-url) and including any connection parameters:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./workload.LATEST fixtures load tpcc \
    --warehouses=1000 \
    "postgres://root@<node1 address>?sslmode=disable"
    ~~~

    This command runs the TPC-C workload against the cluster. This will take about an hour and loads 1,000 "warehouses" of data.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
    For more `tpcc` options, use `workload run tpcc --help`. For details about other load generators included in `workload`, use `workload run --help`.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

4. To monitor the load generator's progress, follow along with the process on the **Admin UI > Jobs** table.

     Open the [Admin UI](admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html) by pointing a browser to the address in the `admin` field in the standard output of any node on startup. Follow along with the process on the **Admin UI > Jobs** table.

### Step 4. Run the benchmark

Still on the fourth instance, run `workload` for five minutes against the other 3 instances:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ ./workload.LATEST run tpcc \
--ramp=30s \
--warehouses=1000 \
--duration=300s \
--split \
--scatter \
"postgres://root@<node1 address>?sslmode=disable postgres://root@<node2 address>?sslmode=disable postgres://root@<node3 address>?sslmode=disable"
~~~

### Step 5. Interpret the results

Once the `workload` has finished running, you should see a final output line:

~~~ shell
_elapsed_______tpmC____efc__avg(ms)__p50(ms)__p90(ms)__p95(ms)__p99(ms)_pMax(ms)
  298.9s    13154.0 102.3%     75.1     71.3    113.2    130.0    184.5    436.2
~~~

You will also see some audit checks and latency statistics for each individual query. For this run, some of those checks might indicate that they were `SKIPPED` due to insufficient data. For a more comprehensive test, run `workload` for a longer duration (e.g., two hours). The `tpmC` (new order transactions/minute) number is the headline number and `efc` ("efficiency") tells you how close CockroachDB gets to theoretical maximum `tpmC`.

The [TPC-C specification](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-c_v5.11.0.pdf) has p90 latency requirements in the order of seconds, but as you see here, CockroachDB far surpasses that requirement with p90 latencies in the hundreds of milliseconds.

## Benchmark a large cluster

The methodology for reproducing CockroachDB's 30-node, 10,000 warehouse TPC-C result is similar to that for the [3-node, 1,000 warehouse example](#benchmark-a-small-cluster). The only difference (besides the larger node count and dataset) is that you will use CockroachDB's [partitioning](partitioning.html) feature to ensure replicas for any given section of data are located on the same nodes that will be queried by the load generator for that section of data. Partitioning helps distribute the workload evenly across the cluster.

### Before you start

Benchmarking a large cluster uses [partitioning](partitioning.html). You must have a valid enterprise license to use partitioning features. For details about requesting and setting a trial or full enterprise license, see [Enterprise Licensing](enterprise-licensing.html).

### Step 1. Create 30 Google Cloud Platform GCE instances

1. [Create 30 instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance) for your CockroachDB nodes. While creating each instance:  
    - Use the `n1-highcpu-16` machine type.

        For our TPC-C benchmarking, we use `n1-highcpu-16` machines. Currently, we believe this (or higher vCPU count machines) is the best configuration for CockroachDB under high traffic scenarios.
    - [Create and mount a local SSD](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#create_local_ssd).

        We attach a single local SSD to each virtual machine. Local SSDs are low latency disks attached to each VM, which maximizes performance. We chose this configuration because it best resembles what a bare metal deployment would look like, with machines directly connected to one physical disk each. We do not recommend using network-attached block storage.
    - [Optimize the local SSD for write performance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#optimize_local_ssd) (see the **Disable write cache flushing** section).
    - To apply the Admin UI firewall rule you created earlier, click **Management, disk, networking, SSH keys**, select the **Networking** tab, and then enter `cockroachdb` in the **Network tags** field.

2. Note the internal IP address of each `n1-highcpu-16` instance. You'll need these addresses when starting the CockroachDB nodes.

3. Create a 31st instance for running the TPC-C benchmark.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
This configuration is intended for performance benchmarking only. For production deployments, there are other important considerations, such as ensuring that data is balanced across at least three availability zones for resiliency. See the [Production Checklist](recommended-production-settings.html) for more details.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Step 2. Start a 30-node cluster

1. SSH to the first `n1-highcpu-16` instance.

2. Download the [CockroachDB archive](https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz) for Linux, extract the binary, and copy it into the `PATH`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz \
    | tar -xz
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cp -i cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64/cockroach /usr/local/bin/
    ~~~

    If you get a permissions error, prefix the command with `sudo`.

3. Run the [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) command:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start \
    --insecure \
    --advertise-addr=<node1 internal address> \
    --join=<node1 internal address>,<node2 internal address>,<node3 internal address>, [...] \
    --cache=.25 \
    --max-sql-memory=.25 \
    --locality=rack=1 \
    --background
    ~~~

    Each node will start with a [locality](start-a-node.html#locality) that includes an artificial "rack number" (e.g., `--locality=rack=1`). Use 10 racks for 30 nodes so that every tenth node is part of the same rack (e.g., `--locality=rack=2`, `--locality=rack=3`, ...).

4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for the other 29 `n1-highcpu-16` instances.

5. From the 31st `n1-highcpu-16` instance, run the [`cockroach init`](initialize-a-cluster.html) command:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach init --insecure --host=<address of any node>
    ~~~

    Each node then prints helpful details to the [standard output](start-a-node.html#standard-output), such as the CockroachDB version, the URL for the Web UI, and the SQL URL for clients.

### Step 3. Add an enterprise license

For this benchmark, you will use partitioning, which is an enterprise feature. For details about requesting and setting a trial or full enterprise license, see [Enterprise Licensing](enterprise-licensing.html).

To add an enterprise license to your cluster once it is started, [use the built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) as follows:

1. SSH to the 31st instance (the one not running a CockroachDB node) and launch the built-in SQL client:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure --host=localhost
    ~~~

2. Add your enterprise license:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = '<secret>';
    ~~~

3. Exit the interactive shell, using `\q` or `ctrl-d`.

### Step 4. Load data for the benchmark

CockroachDB offers a pre-built `workload` binary for Linux that includes several load generators for simulating client traffic against your cluster. This step features CockroachDB's version of the [TPC-C](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) workload.

1. Still on the 31st instance (the one not running a CockroachDB node), download `workload`, and make it executable:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ wget https://edge-binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach/workload.LATEST ; chmod 755 workload.LATEST
    ~~~

2. Rename and copy `workload` into the `PATH`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cp -i workload.LATEST /usr/local/bin/workload
    ~~~

3. Start the TPC-C workload, pointing it at the [connection string of a node](connection-parameters.html#connect-using-a-url) and including any connection parameters:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $  ./workload.LATEST fixtures load tpcc \
    --warehouses=10000 \
    "postgres://root@<node1 address>?sslmode=disable"
    ~~~

    This command runs the TPC-C workload against the cluster. This will take at about an hour and loads 10,000 "warehouses" of data.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
    For more `tpcc` options, use `workload run tpcc --help`. For details about other load generators included in `workload`, use `workload run --help`.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

4. To monitor the load generator's progress, follow along with the process on the **Admin UI > Jobs** table.

     Open the [Admin UI](admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html) by pointing a browser to the address in the `admin` field in the standard output of any node on startup.

### Step 5. Increase the snapshot rate

To [increase the snapshot rate](cluster-settings.html), which helps speed up this large-scale data movement:

1. Still on the 31st instance, launch the built-in SQL client:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure --host=localhost
    ~~~

2. Set the cluster setting to increase the snapshot rate:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.snapshot_rebalance.max_rate='64MiB';
    ~~~

3. Exit the interactive shell, using `\q` or `ctrl-d`.

### Step 6. Partition the database

Next, [partition your database](partitioning.html) to divide all of the TPC-C tables and indexes into ten partitions, one per rack, and then use [zone configurations](configure-replication-zones.html) to pin those partitions to a particular rack.

1. Still on the 31st instance, start the partitioning:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ulimit -n 10000 && workload.LATEST run tpcc \
    --partitions=10 \
    --split \
    --scatter \
    --warehouses=10000 \
    --duration=1s \
    "postgres://root@<node1 address>?sslmode=disable postgres://root@<node2 address>?sslmode=disable postgres://root@<node3 address>?sslmode=disable [...space separated list]"
    ~~~

    This command runs the TPC-C workload against the cluster for 1 second, long enough to add the partitions.

    Partitioning the data will take at least 12 hours. It takes this long because all of the data (over 2TB replicated for TPC-C-10K) needs to be moved to the right locations.

2. To watch the progress, follow along with the process on the **Admin UI > Metrics > Queues > Replication Queue** graph. Change the timeframe to **Last 10 Min** to view a more granular graph.

    Open the [Admin UI](admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html) by pointing a browser to the address in the `admin` field in the standard output of any node on startup.

    Once the Replication Queue gets to `0` for all actions and stays there, the cluster should be finished rebalancing and is ready for testing.

### Step 7. Run the benchmark

Still on the 31st instance, run `workload` for five minutes against the other 30 instances:

~~~ shell
$ ulimit -n 10000 && ./workload.LATEST run tpcc \
--warehouses=10000 \
--ramp=30s \
--duration=300s \
--split \
--scatter \
"postgres://root@<node1 address>?sslmode=disable postgres://root@<node2 address>?sslmode=disable postgres://root@<node3 address>?sslmode=disable [...space separated list]"
~~~

### Step 8. Interpret the results

Once the `workload` has finished running, you should see a final output line similar to the output in [Benchmark a small cluster](#benchmark-a-small-cluster). The `tpmC` should be about 10x higher, reflecting the increase in the number of warehouses:

~~~ shell
_elapsed_______tpmC____efc__avg(ms)__p50(ms)__p90(ms)__p95(ms)__p99(ms)_pMax(ms)
  291.6s   131109.8 102.0%    115.3     88.1    184.5    268.4    637.5   4295.0
~~~

You will also see some audit checks and latency statistics for each individual query. For this run, some of those checks might indicate that they were `SKIPPED` due to insufficient data. For a more comprehensive test, run `workload` for a longer duration (e.g., two hours). The `tpmC` (new order transactions/minute) number is the headline number and `efc` ("efficiency") tells you how close CockroachDB gets to theoretical maximum `tpmC`.

The [TPC-C specification](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-c_v5.11.0.pdf) has p90 latency requirements in the order of seconds, but as you see here, CockroachDB far surpasses that requirement with p90 latencies in the hundreds of milliseconds.

<!-- ## Roachprod directions for performance benchmarking a small cluster

Use roachprod to create cluster: `roachprod create lauren-tpcc --gce-machine-type "n1-highcpu-16" --local-ssd --nodes 4`

Download latest version of CockroachDB:

- `roachprod run lauren-tpcc 'curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz'`

- `roachprod run lauren-tpcc "curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz | tar -xvz; mv cockroach-v2.0.4.linux-amd64/cockroach cockroach"`

Configure SSD to be more performant: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc -- 'sudo umount /mnt/data1; sudo mount -o discard,defaults,nobarrier /dev/disk/by-id/google-local-ssd-0 /mnt/data1/; mount | grep /mnt/data1'`

Start the 3 nodes: `roachprod start lauren-tpcc:1-3`

Add license:

- `roachprod sql lauren-tpcc:1`
- Set CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = '<secret>'

Run sample workload and RESTORE TPC-C data: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc:4 "wget https://edge-binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach/workload.LATEST && chmod a+x workload.LATEST"`

Tell workload to load dataset to cluster: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc:4 "./workload.LATEST fixtures load tpcc {pgurl:1} --warehouses=1000"` (this will take about an hour)

Check on progress by navigating to the Admin UI > Jobs dashboard: `roachprod adminurl lauren-tpcc:1`

Once RESTORE is complete, run the benchmark: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc:4 "./workload.LATEST run tpcc --ramp=30s --warehouses=1000 --duration=300s --split --scatter {pgurl:1-3}"`

Once the workload has finished running, you should see a final output line:

~~~ shell

  298.8s    13149.8 102.3%    108.4    100.7    176.2    201.3    285.2    604.0
~~~

## Roachprod directions for performance benchmarking on a large cluster

Use roachprod to create cluster: `roachprod create lauren-tpcc --gce-machine-type "n1-highcpu-16" --local-ssd --nodes 31`

Note: Since partitioning will take ~12hrs, you should extend your test cluster's lifetime (if you're using roachprod): `roachprod extend lauren-tpcc --lifetime=30h`

Download latest version of CockroachDB:

- `roachprod run lauren-tpcc 'curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz'`

- `roachprod run lauren-tpcc "curl https://binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach-{{ page.release_info.version }}.linux-amd64.tgz | tar -xvz; mv cockroach-v2.0.4.linux-amd64/cockroach cockroach"`

Configure SSD to be more performant: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc -- 'sudo umount /mnt/data1; sudo mount -o discard,defaults,nobarrier /dev/disk/by-id/google-local-ssd-0 /mnt/data1/; mount | grep /mnt/data1'`

Start the 30 nodes: `roachprod start lauren-tpcc:1-30 --racks 10`

Add license:

- `roachprod sql lauren-tpcc:1 -- -e "SET CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = '<secret>';"`

Run sample workload and RESTORE TPC-C data: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc:31 "wget https://edge-binaries.cockroachdb.com/cockroach/workload.LATEST && chmod a+x workload.LATEST"`

Tell workload to load dataset to cluster: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc:31 "./workload.LATEST fixtures load tpcc {pgurl:1} --warehouses=10000"` (this will take about an hour)

Check on progress by navigating to the Admin UI > Jobs dashboard: `roachprod adminurl lauren-tpcc:1`

Once RESTORE is complete, set the snapshot cluster setting: `roachprod sql lauren-tpcc:1 -- -e "SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.snapshot_rebalance.max_rate='64MiB';"`

Partition the database: `roachprod ssh lauren-tpcc:31 "ulimit -n 10000 && ./workload.LATEST run tpcc --partitions=10 --split --scatter --warehouses=10000 --duration=1s {pgurl:1-30}"`

This will take ~12hrs. Once the Replication Queue (Admin UI) gets to `0` and stays there, the cluster should be finished rebalancing and is ready for testing.

To check that each range is correctly partitioned, use `SHOW testing_ranges FROM TABLE tpcc.new_order;` This will show you a table with the `RANGE ID` and `REPLICAS`. Once the `REPLICAS` column sorts itself (e.g., Range 1,2,3 Range 4,5,6 etc.), partitioning is done.

Run the benchmark: `roachprod run lauren-tpcc:31 "ulimit -n 10000 && ./workload.LATEST run tpcc --ramp=30s --warehouses=10000 --duration=300s --split --scatter {pgurl:1-30}"`

Once the workload has finished running, you should see a final output line.-->
