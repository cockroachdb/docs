This tutorial shows you how build a simple Go application with CockroachDB using a PostgreSQL-compatible driver or ORM.

We have tested the [Go pq driver](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq) and the [GORM ORM](http://gorm.io) enough to claim **beta-level** support, so those are featured here. If you encounter problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/new) with details to help us make progress toward full support.

## Before you begin

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/before-you-begin.md %}

## Step 1. Install the GORM ORM

To install [GORM](http://gorm.io), run the following commands:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go get -u github.com/lib/pq # dependency
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go get -u github.com/jinzhu/gorm
~~~

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="secure">

## Step 2. Create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/create-maxroach-user-and-bank-database.md %}

## Step 3. Generate a certificate for the `maxroach` user

Create a certificate and key for the `maxroach` user by running the following command. The code samples will run as this user.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach cert create-client maxroach --certs-dir=certs --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
~~~

## Step 4. Run the Go code

The following code uses the [GORM](http://gorm.io) ORM to map Go-specific objects to SQL operations. Specifically:

- `db.AutoMigrate(&Account{})` creates an `accounts` table based on the Account model.
- `db.Create(&Account{})` inserts rows into the table.
- `db.Find(&accounts)` selects from the table so that balances can be printed.
- The funds transfer occurs in `transferFunds()`. To ensure that we [handle retry errors](transactions.html#client-side-intervention), we write an application-level retry loop that, in case of error, sleeps before trying the funds transfer again. If it encounters another error, it sleeps again for a longer interval, implementing [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

Copy the code or
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/gorm-sample.go" download>download it directly</a>.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To clone a version of the code below that connects to insecure clusters, run the command below. Note that you will need to edit the connection string to use the certificates that you generated when you set up your secure cluster.
`git clone https://github.com/cockroachlabs/hello-world-go-gorm`
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ go
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/app/gorm-sample.go %}
~~~

Then run the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go run gorm-sample.go
~~~

The output should show the account balances before and after the funds transfer:

~~~ shell
Balance at '2019-08-06 13:37:19.311423 -0400 EDT m=+0.034072606':
1 1000
2 250
Balance at '2019-08-06 13:37:19.325654 -0400 EDT m=+0.048303286':
1 900
2 350
~~~

## Step 2. Create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/insecure/create-maxroach-user-and-bank-database.md %}

## Step 3. Run the Go code

The following code uses the [GORM](http://gorm.io) ORM to map Go-specific objects to SQL operations. Specifically:

- `db.AutoMigrate(&Account{})` creates an `accounts` table based on the Account model.
- `db.Create(&Account{})` inserts rows into the table.

- The funds transfer occurs in `transferFunds()`.

If it encounters another error, it sleeps again for a longer interval, implementing [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

To get the code below, clone the `hello-world-go-gorm` repo to your machine:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
git clone https://github.com/cockroachlabs/hello-world-go-gorm
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ go
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/app/insecure/gorm-sample.go %}
~~~

Change to the directory where you cloned the repo and run the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ go run main.go
~~~

The output should show the account balances before and after the funds transfer:

~~~ shell
Balance at '2019-07-15 13:34:22.536363 -0400 EDT m=+0.019918599':
1 1000
2 250
Balance at '2019-07-15 13:34:22.540037 -0400 EDT m=+0.023592845':
1 900
2 350
