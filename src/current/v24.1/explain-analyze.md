title: EXPLAIN ANALYZE
summary: The EXPLAIN ANALYZE statement executes a query and generates a physical statement plan with execution statistics.
toc: true
docs_area: reference.sql
---

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` [statement]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/sql-statements.md %}) **executes a SQL query** and generates a statement plan with execution statistics. Statement plans provide information around SQL execution, which can be used to troubleshoot slow queries by figuring out where time is being spent, how long a processor (i.e., a component that takes streams of input rows and processes them according to a specification) is not doing work, etc. The `(DISTSQL)` option returns the statement plan and performance statistics as well as a generated link to a graphical distributed SQL physical statement plan tree. For more information about distributed SQL queries, see the [DistSQL section of our SQL layer architecture docs]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#distsql). The `(DEBUG)` option generates a URL to download a bundle with more details about the statement plan for advanced debugging.

## Parameters

Parameter          | Description
-------------------|-----------
`PLAN`             |  _(Default)_ Execute the statement and return a statement plan with planning and execution time for an [explainable statement]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/sql-grammar.md %}#preparable_stmt). See [`PLAN` option](#plan-option).
`VERBOSE`          | Execute the statement and show as much information as possible about the statement plan.
`TYPES`            | Execute the statement and include the intermediate [data types]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/data-types.md %}) CockroachDB chooses to evaluate intermediate SQL expressions.
`DEBUG`            | Execute the statement and generate a ZIP file containing files with detailed information about the query and the database objects referenced in the query. See [`DEBUG` option](#debug-option).
`REDACT`           | Execute the statement and redact constants, literal values, parameter values, and personally identifiable information (PII) from the output. See [`REDACT` option](#redact-option).
`DISTSQL`          | Execute the statement and return a statement plan and performance statistics as well as a generated link to a graphical distributed SQL physical statement plan tree. See [`DISTSQL` option](#distsql-option).
`preparable_stmt`  | The [statement]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/sql-grammar.md %}#preparable_stmt) you want to execute and analyze. All preparable statements are explainable.

## Required privileges

The user requires the appropriate [privileges]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/security-reference/authorization.md %}#managing-privileges) for the statement being explained.

## Success responses

A successful `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement returns a table with the following details in the `info` column:

 Detail | Description
--------|------------
[Global properties](#global-properties) | The properties and statistics that apply to the entire statement plan.
[Statement plan tree properties](#statement-plan-tree-properties) | A tree representation of the hierarchy of the statement plan.
Node details | The properties, columns, and ordering details for the current statement plan node in the tree.
Time | The time details for the statement. The total time is the planning and execution time of the statement. The execution time is the time it took for the final statement plan to complete. The network time is the amount of time it took to distribute the statement across the relevant nodes in the cluster. Some statements do not need to be distributed, so the network time is 0ms.

If you use the [`DISTSQL` option](#distsql-option), the statement will also return a URL generated for a physical statement plan that provides high level information about how a statement will be executed. {% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/physical-plan-url.md %} For details about reading the physical statement plan, see [DistSQL plan diagram](#distsql-plan-diagram).

If you use the [`DEBUG` option](#debug-option), the statement will return only a URL and instructions to download the `DEBUG` bundle, which includes the physical statement plan.

### Global properties

Property        | Description
----------------|------------
`planning time` | The total time the planner took to create a statement plan.
`execution time` | The time it took for the final statement plan to complete.
`distribution` | Whether the statement was distributed or local. If `distribution` is `full`, execution of the statement is performed by multiple nodes in parallel, then the results are returned by the gateway node. If `local`, the execution plan is performed only on the gateway node. Even if the execution plan is `local`, row data may be fetched from remote nodes, but the processing of the data is performed by the local node.
`vectorized` | Whether the [vectorized execution engine]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/vectorized-execution.md %}) was used in this statement.
`rows read from KV` | The number of rows read from the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}).
`cumulative time spent in KV` | The total amount of time spent in the storage layer.
`cumulative time spent due to contention` | The total amount of time this statement spent waiting in [contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention).
`maximum memory usage` | The maximum amount of memory used by this statement anytime during its execution.
`network usage` | The amount of data transferred over the network while the statement was executed. If the value is 0 B, the statement was executed on a single node and didn't use the network.
`sql cpu time` | The total amount of time spent in the [SQL layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}). It does not include time spent in the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}).
`regions` | The [regions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-regions.md %}) where the affected nodes were located.
`max sql temp disk usage` | ([`DISTSQL`](#distsql-option) option only) How much disk spilling occurs when executing a query. This property is displayed only when the disk usage is greater than zero.
`estimated RUs consumed` | The estimated number of [Request Units (RUs)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster-serverless#request-units) consumed by the statement. This property is visible only on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters.

### Statement plan tree properties

Statement plan tree properties | Description
-------------------------------|------------
`processor` | Each processor in the statement plan hierarchy has a node with details about that phase of the statement. For example, a statement with a `GROUP BY` clause has a `group` processor with details about the cluster nodes, rows, and operations related to the `GROUP BY` operation.
`nodes` | The names of the CockroachDB cluster nodes affected by this phase of the statement.
`regions` | The [regions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-regions.md %}) where the affected nodes were located.
`actual row count` | The actual number of rows affected by this processor during execution.
`vectorized batch count` | When the [vectorized execution engine]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/vectorized-execution.md %}) is used, the number of batches of column data that are processed by the vectorized engine.
`KV time` | The total time this phase of the statement was in the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}).
`KV contention time` | The time the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}) was in contention during this phase of the statement.
`KV rows read` | During scans, the number of rows in the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}) read by this phase of the statement.
`KV bytes read` | During scans, the amount of data read from the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}) during this phase of the statement.
`KV gRPC calls` | During scans, the number of [gRPC calls]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/distribution-layer.md %}#grpc) made between nodes during this phase of the statement.
`estimated max memory allocated` | The estimated maximum allocated memory for a statement.
`estimated max sql temp disk usage` | The estimated maximum temporary disk usage for a statement.
`MVCC step count (ext/int)` | The number of times that the underlying storage iterator stepped forward during the work to serve the operator's reads, including stepping over [MVCC keys]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}#mvcc) that could not be used in the scan.
`MVCC seek count (ext/int)` | The number of times that the underlying storage iterator jumped (seeked) to a different data location.
`sql cpu time` | The total time this phase of the statement was in the [SQL layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}). It does not include time spent in the [storage layer]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/storage-layer.md %}).
`estimated row count` | The estimated number of rows affected by this processor according to the statement planner, the percentage of the table the query spans, and when the statistics for the table were last collected.
`table` | The table and index used in a scan operation in a statement, in the form `{table name}@{index name}`.
`spans` | The interval of the key space read by the processor. `FULL SCAN` indicates that the table is scanned on all key ranges of the index (also known as a "full table scan" or "unlimited full scan"). `FULL SCAN (SOFT LIMIT)` indicates that a full table scan can be performed, but will halt early once enough rows have been scanned. `LIMITED SCAN` indicates that the table will be scanned on a subset of key ranges of the index. `[/1 - /1]` indicates that only the key with value `1` is read by the processor.

## `PLAN` option

By default, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` uses the `PLAN` option. `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (PLAN)` produce the same output.

### `PLAN` suboptions

The `PLAN` suboptions `VERBOSE` and `TYPES` described in [`EXPLAIN` options]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/explain.md %}#options) are also supported. For an example, see [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (VERBOSE)`](#explain-analyze-verbose).

## `DISTSQL` option

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` generates a physical statement in the [plan diagram](#distsql-plan-diagram). The DistSQL plan diagram displays the physical statement plan, as well as execution statistics. The statistics listed depend on the query type and the [execution engine used]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/vectorized-execution.md %}). If the query contains subqueries or post-queries there will be multiple diagrams.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You can use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL)` only as the top-level statement in a query.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### DistSQL plan diagram

The graphical plan diagram displays the processors and operations that make up the statement plan. While the text output from the `PLAN` option shows the statement plan across the cluster, the `DISTSQL` option shows details on each node involved in the query.

Field | Description | Execution engine
------+-------------+----------------
&lt;Processor&gt;/&lt;id&gt; | The processor and processor ID used to read data into the SQL execution engine.<br><br>A processor is a component that takes streams of input rows, processes them according to a specification, and outputs one stream of rows.

## `DEBUG` option

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)` executes a query and generates a link to a ZIP file that contains the [physical statement plan](#distsql-plan-diagram), execution statistics, statement tracing, and other information about the query.

File                | Description
--------------------+-------------------
`stats-{table}.sql` | Contains [statistics]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-statistics.md %}) for a table in the query.
`schema.sql`        | Contains [`CREATE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-table.md %}) statements for objects in the query.
`env.sql`           | Contains information about the CockroachDB environment.

You can obtain this ZIP file by following the link provided in the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)` output, or by activating [statement diagnostics]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-statements-page.md %}#diagnostics) in the DB Console.

{% include common/sql/statement-bundle-warning.md %}

## `REDACT` option

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (REDACT)` executes a query and causes constants, literal values, parameter values, and personally identifiable information (PII) to be redacted as `‹×›` in the output. 

You can use the `REDACT` flag in combination with the [`PLAN`](#plan-option) option (including the `VERBOSE` and `TYPES` [suboptions](#plan-suboptions)) to redact sensitive values in the physical statement plan, and with the [`DEBUG`](#debug-option) option to redact values in the statement bundle.

For an example, see [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (REDACT)`](#explain-analyze-redact).

## Examples

The following examples use the [`movr` example dataset]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-demo.md %}#datasets).

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/demo_movr.md %}

### `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` without an option, or equivalently with the `PLAN` option, to execute a query and display the physical statement plan with execution statistics.

For example, the following `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement executes a simple query against the [MovR database]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/movr.md %}) and then displays the physical statement plan with execution statistics:

### `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`

Use the [`DEBUG`](#debug-option) option to generate a ZIP file containing files with information about the query and the database objects referenced in the query. For example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG) SELECT city, AVG(revenue) FROM rides GROUP BY city;
~~~

~~~
                                       info
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Statement diagnostics bundle generated. Download using the SQL shell or command

  SQL shell: \statement-diag download 938793171367755777
  Command line: cockroach statement-diag download 938793171367755777
(4 rows)
~~~

To download the ZIP file containing the statement diagnostics, run the `\statement-diag download` or `cockroach statement-diag download` commands. You can also obtain the bundle by activating [statement diagnostics]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-statements-page.md %}#diagnostics) in the DB Console.

### `EXPLAIN ANALYZE (REDACT)`

Use the [`REDACT` option](#redact-option) to execute a query and cause constants, literal values, parameter values, and personally identifiable information (PII) to be redacted as `‹×›` in the physical statement plan or statement bundle.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE (REDACT) SELECT * FROM rides WHERE revenue > 90 ORDER BY revenue ASC;
~~~
