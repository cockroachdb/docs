Core and {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds offer different levels of configurability. {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds allow for active changefeed jobs to be [paused](#pause), [resumed](#resume), and [canceled](#cancel).

This page describes:

- [Guidelines](#before-you-create-a-changefeed) to consider before creating a changefeed.
- [Reference examples](#configure-a-changefeed) for creating and managing a changefeed.

## Before you create a changefeed

1. Enable rangefeeds on CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }}. Refer to [Enable rangefeeds](#enable-rangefeeds) for instructions.
1. Decide on whether you will run an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} or Core changefeed. Refer to the [Overview]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) page for a comparative capability table.
1. Plan the number of changefeeds versus the number of tables to include in a single changefeed for your cluster. {% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/changefeed-number-limit.md %} Refer to [System resources and running changefeeds](#system-resources-and-running-changefeeds) and [Recommendations for the number of target tables](#recommendations-for-the-number-of-target-tables).
1. Consider whether your {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} [changefeed use case](#create) would be better served by [change data capture queries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cdc-queries.md %}) that can filter data on a single table. CDC queries can improve the efficiency of changefeeds because the job will not need to encode as much change data.
1. Read the [Considerations](#considerations) section that provides information on changefeed interactions that could affect how you configure or run your changefeed.

### Enable rangefeeds

Changefeeds connect to a long-lived request (i.e., a rangefeed), which pushes changes as they happen. This reduces the latency of row changes, as well as reduces transaction restarts on tables being watched by a changefeed for some workloads.

**Rangefeeds must be enabled for a changefeed to work.** To [enable the cluster setting]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-cluster-setting.md %}):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING kv.rangefeed.enabled = true;
~~~

If you are working on a CockroachDB Serverless cluster, the `kv.rangefeed.enabled` cluster setting is enabled by default.

Any created changefeeds will error until this setting is enabled. Note that enabling rangefeeds currently has a small performance cost (about a 5-10% increase in latencies), whether or not the rangefeed is being used in a changefeed.

For further detail on performance-related configuration, refer to the [Advanced Changefeed Confguration]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/advanced-changefeed-configuration.md %}) page.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
[`MuxRangefeed`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/advanced-changefeed-configuration.md %}#mux-rangefeeds) is a subsystem that improves the performance of rangefeeds with scale, which is enabled by default in v24.1 and later versions.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Recommendations for the number of target tables

When creating a changefeed, it's important to consider the number of changefeeds versus the number of tables to include in a single changefeed:

- Changefeeds each have their own memory overhead, so every running changefeed will increase total memory usage.
- Creating a single changefeed that will watch hundreds of tables can affect the performance of a changefeed by introducing coupling, where the performance of a target table affects the performance of the changefeed watching it. For example, any [schema change]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-messages.md %}#schema-changes) on any of the tables will affect the entire changefeed's performance.

To watch multiple tables, we recommend creating a changefeed with a comma-separated list of tables. However, we do **not** recommend creating a single changefeed for watching hundreds of tables.

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/recommendation-monitoring-pts.md %}

### System resources and running changefeeds

When you are running more than 10 changefeeds on a cluster, it is important to monitor the [CPU usage]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overload-dashboard.md %}). A larger cluster will be able to run more changefeeds concurrently compared to a smaller cluster with more limited resources.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/changefeed-number-limit.md %}
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To maintain a high number of changefeeds in your cluster:

- Connect to different nodes to create each changefeed. The node on which you start the changefeed will become the _coordinator_ node for the changefeed job. The coordinator node acts as an administrator: keeping track of all other nodes during job execution and the changefeed work as it completes. As a result, this node will use more resources for the changefeed job. Refer to [How does an Enterprise changefeed work?]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work.md %}) for more detail.
- Consider logically grouping the target tables into one changefeed. When a changefeed pauses, it will stop emitting messages for the target tables. Grouping tables of related data into a single changefeed may make sense for your workload. However, we do not recommend watching hundreds of tables in a single changefeed. Refer to [Garbage collection and changefeeds]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/protect-changefeed-data.md %}) for more detail on protecting data from garbage collection when a changefeed is paused.

### Considerations

- If you require [`resolved`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md %}#resolved-option) message frequency under `30s`, then you **must** set the [`min_checkpoint_frequency`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md %}#min-checkpoint-frequency) option to at least the desired `resolved` frequency.
- Many DDL queries (including [`TRUNCATE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/truncate.md %}), [`DROP TABLE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/drop-table.md %}), and queries that add a column family) will cause errors on a changefeed watching the affected tables. You will need to [start a new changefeed]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md %}#start-a-new-changefeed-where-another-ended). If a table is truncated that a changefeed with `on_error='pause'` is watching, you will also need to start a new changefeed. See change data capture [Known Limitations]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) for more detail.
- Partial or intermittent sink unavailability may impact changefeed stability. If a sink is unavailable, messages can't send, which means that a changefeed's high-water mark timestamp is at risk of falling behind the cluster's [garbage collection window]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}#replication-zone-variables). Throughput and latency can be affected once the sink is available again. However, [ordering guarantees]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-messages.md %}#ordering-and-delivery-guarantees) will still hold for as long as a changefeed [remains active]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.md %}#monitor-a-changefeed).
- When an [`IMPORT INTO`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/import-into.md %}) statement is run, any current changefeed jobs targeting that table will fail.
- After you [restore from a full-cluster backup]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/restore.md %}#full-cluster), changefeed jobs will **not** resume on the new cluster. It is necessary to manually create the changefeeds following the full-cluster restore.

## Configure a changefeed

An {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed streams row-level changes in a configurable format to a configurable sink (i.e., Kafka or a cloud storage sink). You can [create](#create), [pause](#pause), [resume](#resume), and [cancel](#cancel) an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed. For a step-by-step example connecting to a specific sink, see the [Changefeed Examples]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-examples.md %}) page.

### Create

To create an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE table_name, table_name2 INTO '{scheme}://{host}:{port}?{query_parameters}';
~~~

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/url-encoding.md %}

When you create a changefeed **without** specifying a sink, CockroachDB sends the changefeed events to the SQL client. Consider the following regarding the [display format]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-sql.md %}#sql-flag-format) in your SQL client:

- If you do not define a display format, the CockroachDB SQL client will automatically use `ndjson` format.
- If you specify a display format, the client will use that format (e.g., `--format=csv`).
- If you set the client display format to `ndjson` and set the changefeed [`format`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md %}#format) to `csv`, you'll receive JSON format with CSV nested inside.
- If you set the client display format to `csv` and set the changefeed [`format`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-changefeed.md %}#format) to `json`, you'll receive a comma-separated list of JSON values.

### Show

To show a list of {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed jobs:

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/show-changefeed-job.md %}

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/show-changefeed-job-retention.md %}

For more information, refer to [`SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-jobs.md %}#show-changefeed-jobs).

### Pause

To pause an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
PAUSE JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, refer to [`PAUSE JOB`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/pause-job.md %}).

### Resume

To resume a paused {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
RESUME JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, refer to [`RESUME JOB`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/resume-job.md %}).

### Cancel

To cancel an {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}

## Create a changefeed

A core changefeed streams row-level changes to the client indefinitely until the underlying connection is closed or the changefeed is canceled.

To create a core changefeed:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR table_name;
~~~

For more information, see [`EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/changefeed-for.md %}).
