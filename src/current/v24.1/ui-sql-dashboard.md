The **SQL** dashboard in the DB Console lets you monitor the performance of your SQL queries.

To view this dashboard, [access the DB Console]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}#db-console-access), click **Metrics** in the left-hand navigation, and then select **Dashboard** > **SQL**.

## Dashboard navigation

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/ui/ui-metrics-navigation.md %}

For monitoring CockroachDB, it is sufficient to use the [**Open SQL Sessions**](#open-sql-sessions), [**SQL Byte Traffic**](#sql-byte-traffic), [**SQL Statements**](#sql-statements), [**Service Latency**](#service-latency-sql-99th-percentile), and [**Transactions**](#transactions) graphs.

The **SQL** dashboard displays the following time series graphs:

## Open SQL Sessions

- In the node view, the graph shows the number of connections open between the client and the selected node.

  - {% include {{page.version.version}}/sql/server-side-connection-limit.md %}

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the total number of SQL client connections to all nodes combined, with lines for each node.

## SQL Connection Rate

The **SQL Connection Rate** is an average of the number of connection attempts per second over an aggregation window.

- In the node view, the graph shows the rate of SQL connection attempts between clients and the selected node.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the rate of SQL connection attempts to all nodes, with lines for each node.

## Open SQL Transactions

- In the node view, the graph shows the total number of open SQL transactions on the node.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the total number of open SQL transactions across all nodes in the cluster.

See the [Transactions page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-transactions-page.md %}) for more details on the transactions.

## Active SQL Statements

- In the node view, the graph shows the total number of SQL statements running on that node.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the total number of SQL statements running across all nodes in the cluster.

See the [Statements page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-statements-page.md %}) for more details on the cluster's SQL statements.

## SQL Byte Traffic

The **SQL Byte Traffic** graph helps you correlate SQL query count to byte traffic, especially in bulk data inserts or analytic queries that return data in bulk.

- In the node view, the graph shows the current byte throughput (bytes/second) between all the connected SQL clients and the node. There are lines for bytes in and bytes out.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the aggregate client throughput across all nodes. There are lines for bytes in and bytes out.

## SQL Statements

- In the node view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number of `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` statements per second issued by SQL clients on the node.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the sum of the per-node averages, that is, an aggregate estimation of the current statement load over the cluster, assuming the last 10 seconds of activity per node are representative of this load.

## SQL Statement Errors

- In the node view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number of SQL statements issued to the node that returned a [planning]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#sql-parser-planner-executor),  [runtime]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#sql-parser-planner-executor), or [retry error]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}#error-handling).

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the 10-second average of the number of SQL statements that returned a [planning]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#sql-parser-planner-executor),  [runtime]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#sql-parser-planner-executor), or [retry error]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}#error-handling) across all nodes.

See the [Statements page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-statements-page.md %}) for more details on the cluster's SQL statements.

## SQL Statement Contention

The statement contention metric is a counter that represents the number of statements that have experienced [contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention). If a statement experiences at least one contention "event" (i.e., the statement is forced to wait for another transaction), the counter is incremented at most once.

- In the node view, the graph shows the total number of SQL statements that experienced [contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention) on that node.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the total number of SQL statements that experienced [contention]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/performance-best-practices-overview.md %}#transaction-contention) across all nodes in the cluster.

    See the [Statements page]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-statements-page.md %}) for more details on the cluster's SQL statements.

## Full Table/Index Scans

- In the node view, the graph shows the total number of full table and index scans on that node.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the total number of full table and index scans across all nodes in the cluster.

[Examine the statements]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/sql-tuning-with-explain.md %}) that result in full table scans and consider adding [secondary indexes]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/schema-design-indexes.md %}#create-a-secondary-index).

## Active Flows for Distributed SQL Statements

- In the node view, the graph shows the number of flows on that node contributing to the running [distributed SQL]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#distsql) statements.

- In the cluster view, the graph shows the number of flows across all nodes in the cluster contributing to the running [distributed SQL]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/sql-layer.md %}#distsql) statements.
