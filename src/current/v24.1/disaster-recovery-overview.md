summary: Learn how to make your cluster resilient with high availability and disaster recovery features.

Resilient deployments aim for continuity in database operations to protect from data loss and downtime. To maintain resiliency, it is necessary to build deployments with _high availability_ and _disaster recovery_ coverage.

- [High availability](#choose-a-high-availability-strategy): Continuously access data without interruption even in the presence of failures or disruptions to maximize uptime.
- [Disaster recovery](#choose-a-disaster-recovery-strategy): Recover from a major incident or disaster to minimize downtime and data loss.

To build resilient cluster deployments, CockroachDB provides both [built-in replication]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md %}) for high availability and disaster recovery features for coverage during unplanned incidents.

## Resilience strategy

As you evaluate CockroachDB's disaster recovery features, consider your organization's requirements for the amount of tolerable data loss and the acceptable length of time to recover.

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum amount of data loss (measured by time) that an organization can tolerate.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum length of time it should take to restore normal operations following an outage.

For example, when you use backups:

<img src="{{ 'images/v24.1/rpo-rto.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Simulating RPO and RTO. With RPO representing the tolerable data loss, and RTO representing the tolerable time to recovery." style="border:0px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

### Choose a high availability strategy

CockroachDB uses synchronous, built-in replication to create and distribute copies of data, ensuring consistency across the data copies. The database can tolerate nodes going offline without service interruption, whether in a single-region or [multi-region]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %}) cluster.

### Choose a disaster recovery strategy

CockroachDB is designed to recover automatically; however, building [backups]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}) or [physical cluster replication]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-overview.md %}) into your disaster recovery planning is an important part of a resilient deployment.
