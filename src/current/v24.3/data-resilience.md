title: Data Resilience
summary: An overview of how CockroachDB deployments can achieve resilience with built-in features and tooling.
toc: true
---

CockroachDB provides built-in [**high availability (HA)**](#high-availability) features and [**disaster recovery (DR)**](#disaster-recovery) tooling to achieve operational resiliency in various deployment [topologies]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/topology-patterns.md %}) and use cases.

- HA features ensure continuous access to data without interruption even in the presence of [failures]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-cockroachdb-resilience.md %}) or disruptions to maximize uptime.
- DR tools allow for recovery from major incidents to minimize downtime and data loss.

You can balance required SLAs and recovery objectives with the cost and management of each of these features to build a resilient deployment.

## High availability

- [**Multi-active availability**]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multi-active-availability.md %}): CockroachDB's built-in [Raft replication]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/replication-layer.md %}) stores data safely and consistently on multiple nodes to ensure no downtime even during a temporary node outage. [Replication controls]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/configure-replication-zones.md %}) allow you to configure the number and location of [replicas]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/architecture/glossary.md %}#replica) to suit a deployment.
  - For more detail on planning for single-region or multi-region recovery, refer to [Single-region survivability planning]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/disaster-recovery-planning.md %}#single-region-survivability-planning) or [Multi-region survivability planning]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/disaster-recovery-planning.md %}#multi-region-survivability-planning).
- [**Advanced fault tolerance**]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/demo-cockroachdb-resilience.md %}): Capabilities built in to CockroachDB to perform routine maintenance operations with minimal impact to foreground performance. For example, [online schema changes]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/online-schema-changes.md %}), [write-ahead log failover]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/cockroach-start.md %}#write-ahead-log-wal-failover).
- **Logical data replication (LDR)** (Preview): A cross-cluster replication tool between active CockroachDB clusters, which supports a range of topologies. LDR provides eventually consistent, table-level replication between the clusters. Individually, each active cluster uses CockroachDB multi-active availability to achieve low, single-region write latency with transactionally consistent writes using Raft replication.

## Disaster recovery

- [**Backup and point-in-time restore**]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/take-backups-with-revision-history-and-restore-from-a-point-in-time.md %}): Point-in-time backup and restore allows you to roll back to a specific point in time. Multiple supported [cloud storage]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/use-cloud-storage.md %}) providers means that you can store backups in your chosen provider. [Incremental backups]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/take-full-and-incremental-backups.md %}) allow you to configure backup frequency for lower [RPO]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/disaster-recovery-overview.md %}).
- [**Physical cluster replication (PCR)**]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-overview.md %}): A cross-cluster replication tool between an active primary CockroachDB cluster and a passive standby CockroachDB cluster. PCR provides transactionally consistent full-cluster replication.

### Choose a DR strategy

CockroachDB is designed to recover automatically; however, building backups or PCR into your DR plan protects against unforeseen incidents.
