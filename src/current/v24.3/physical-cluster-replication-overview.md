{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Physical cluster replication is only supported in CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} clusters.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

CockroachDB **physical cluster replication (PCR)** continuously sends all data at the cluster level from a _primary_ cluster to an independent _standby_ cluster. Existing data and ongoing changes on the active primary cluster, which is serving application data, replicate asynchronously to the passive standby cluster. 

You can [_fail over_]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md %}) from the primary cluster to the standby cluster. This will stop the replication stream, reset the standby cluster to a point in time where all ingested data is consistent, and mark the standby as ready to accept application traffic.

For a list of requirements for PCR, refer to the [Before you begin]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-up-physical-cluster-replication.md %}#before-you-begin) section of the [setup tutorial]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-up-physical-cluster-replication.md %}).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Cockroach Labs also has a [logical data replication]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/logical-data-replication-overview.md %}) tool that continuously replicates tables between an active _source_ CockroachDB cluster to an active _destination_ CockroachDB cluster. Both source and destination can receive application reads and writes, and participate in [_bidirectional_]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/logical-data-replication-overview.md %}#use-cases) LDR for eventual consistency in the replicating tables.

## Use cases

You can use PCR to:

- Meet your RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) requirements. PCR provides lower RTO and RPO than [backup and restore]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}).
- Automatically replicate everything in your primary cluster to recover quickly from a control plane or full cluster failure.
- Protect against region failure when you cannot use individual [multi-region clusters]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/multiregion-overview.md %})â€”for example, if you have a two-datacenter architecture and do not have access to three regions; or, you need low-write latency in a single region. PCR allows for an active-passive (primary-standby) structure across two clusters with the passive cluster in a different region.
- Quickly recover from user error (for example, dropping a database) by [failing over]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md %}) to a time in the near past.
- Create a [blue-green deployment model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_deployment) by using the standby cluster for testing upgrades and hardware changes.

## Features

- **Asynchronous cluster-level replication**: When you initiate a replication stream, it will replicate byte-for-byte all of the primary cluster's existing user data and associated metadata to the standby cluster asynchronously. From then on, it will continuously replicate the primary cluster's data and metadata to the standby cluster. PCR will automatically replicate changes related to operations such as [schema changes]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/online-schema-changes.md %}), user and [privilege]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/security-reference/authorization.md %}#managing-privileges) modifications, and [zone configuration]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-zone-configurations.md %}) updates without any manual work.
- **Transactional consistency**: Avoid conflicts in data after recovery; the replication completes to a transactionally consistent state.
- **Improved RPO and RTO**: Depending on workload and deployment configuration, [replication lag]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-technical-overview.md %}) between the primary and standby is generally in the tens-of-seconds range. The failover process from the primary cluster to the standby should typically happen within five minutes when completing a failover to the latest replicated time using `LATEST`.
- **Failover to a timestamp in the past or the future**: In the case of logical disasters or mistakes, you can [fail over]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md %}) from the primary to the standby cluster to a timestamp in the past. This means that you can return the standby to a timestamp before the mistake was replicated to the standby. You can also configure the [`WITH RETENTION`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/alter-virtual-cluster.md %}#set-a-retention-window) option to control how far in the past you can fail over to. Furthermore, you can plan a failover by specifying a timestamp in the future.
- {% include_cached new-in.html version="v24.3" %} **Read from standby cluster**: You can configure PCR to allow `SELECT` queries on the standby cluster. For more details, refer to [Start a PCR stream with read from standby]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-virtual-cluster.md %}#start-a-pcr-stream-with-read-from-standby).
- **Monitoring**: To monitor the replication's initial progress, current status, and performance, you can use metrics available in the [DB Console]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/ui-overview.md %}) and [Prometheus]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.md %}). For more details, refer to [Physical Cluster Replication Monitoring]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/physical-cluster-replication-monitoring.md %}).

### Manage replication in the SQL shell

To start, manage, and observe PCR, you can use the following SQL statements:

Statement | Action
----------+------
[`CREATE VIRTUAL CLUSTER ... FROM REPLICATION OF ...`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/create-virtual-cluster.md %}) | Start a replication stream.
[`ALTER VIRTUAL CLUSTER ... PAUSE REPLICATION`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/alter-virtual-cluster.md %}) | Pause a running replication stream.
[`ALTER VIRTUAL CLUSTER ... RESUME REPLICATION`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/alter-virtual-cluster.md %}) | Resume a paused replication stream.
[`ALTER VIRTUAL CLUSTER ... START SERVICE SHARED`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/alter-virtual-cluster.md %}#start-a-virtual-cluster) | Initiate a [failover]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md %}).
[`SHOW VIRTUAL CLUSTER`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/show-virtual-cluster.md %}) | Show all virtual clusters.
[`DROP VIRTUAL CLUSTER`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/drop-virtual-cluster.md %}) | Remove a virtual cluster.

## Cluster versions and upgrades

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
The standby cluster must be at the same version as, or one version ahead of, the primary's virtual cluster.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

When PCR is enabled, upgrade with the following procedure. This upgrades the standby cluster before the primary cluster. Within the primary and standby CockroachDB clusters, the system virtual cluster must be at a cluster version greater than or equal to the virtual cluster:

1. [Upgrade the binaries]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}#perform-a-major-version-upgrade) on the primary and standby clusters. Replace the binary on each node of the cluster and restart the node.
1. [Finalize]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually) the upgrade on the standby's system virtual cluster if auto-finalization is disabled.
1. [Finalize]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually) the upgrade on the primary's system virtual cluster if auto-finalization is disabled.
1. [Finalize]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually) the upgrade on the standby's virtual cluster.
1. [Finalize]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/upgrade-cockroach-version.md %}#finalize-a-major-version-upgrade-manually) the upgrade on the primary's virtual cluster.

The standby cluster must be at the same version as, or one version ahead of, the primary's virtual cluster at the time of [failover]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/failover-replication.md %}).
