## Required privileges

- To change the owner of a database, the user must be an `admin` user, or the current owner of the database and a member of the new owner [role](security-reference/authorization.html#roles). The user must also have the `CREATEDB` [privilege](security-reference/authorization.html#managing-privileges).
- To change the owner of a table, the user must be an `admin` user, or the current owner of the table and a member of the new owner [role](security-reference/authorization.html#roles). The new owner role must also have the `CREATE` [privilege](security-reference/authorization.html#managing-privileges) on the schema to which the table belongs.

ALTER DATABASE <name> OWNER TO <newowner>
~~~

`newowner` | The name of the new owner.

## Examples

{% include {{page.version.version}}/sql/movr-statements.md %}

### Change a database's owner

Suppose that the current owner of the `movr` database is `root` and you want to change the owner to a new user named `max`.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER DATABASE movr OWNER TO max;
~~~

To verify that the owner is now `max`, query the `pg_catalog.pg_database` and `pg_catalog.pg_roles` tables:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT rolname FROM pg_catalog.pg_database d JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles r ON d.datdba = r.oid WHERE datname = 'movr';
~~~

~~~
  rolname
-----------
  max
(1 row)
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If the user running the command is not an admin user, they must own the database and be a member of the new owning role. They must also have the `CREATEDB` [privilege](security-reference/authorization.html#managing-privileges).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Change a table's owner

Suppose that the current owner of the `rides` table is `root` and you want to change the owner to a new user named `max`.

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE promo_codes OWNER TO max;
~~~

To verify that the owner is now `max`, query the `pg_catalog.pg_tables` table:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT tableowner FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'promo_codes';
~~~

~~~
  tableowner
--------------
  max
(1 row)
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If the user running the command is not an admin user, they must own the table and be a member of the new owning role. Also, the new owner role must also have the `CREATE` [privilege](security-reference/authorization.html#managing-privileges) on the schema to which the table belongs.
