This page shows you how to identify and, if necessary, cancel SQL queries that are taking longer than expected to process.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}Schema changes (statements beginning with <code>ALTER</code>) cannot currently be cancelled. However, to monitor the progress of schema changes, you can use <a href="show-jobs.html"><code>SHOW JOBS</code></a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}


## Identify Long-Running Queries

Use the [`SHOW QUERIES`](show-queries.html) statement to list details about currently active SQL queries, including each query's `start` timestamp:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW QUERIES;
~~~

You can also filter for queries that have been running for a certain amount of time. For example, to find queries that have been running for more than 3 hours, you would run the following:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM [SHOW CLUSTER QUERIES]
      WHERE start < (now() - INTERVAL '3 hours');
~~~

## Cancel Long-Running Queries

Once you've identified a long-running query via [`SHOW QUERIES`](show-queries.html), note the `query_id` and use it with the [`CANCEL QUERY`](cancel-query.html) statement:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CANCEL QUERY '14dacc1f9a781e3d0000000000000001';
~~~

When a query is successfully cancelled, CockroachDB sends a `query execution canceled` error to the client that issued the query.

- If the canceled query was a single, stand-alone statement, no further action is required by the client.
- If the canceled query was part of a larger, multi-statement [transaction](transactions.html), the client should then issue a [`ROLLBACK`](rollback-transaction.html) statement.

## Improve Query Performance

After cancelling a long-running query, use the [`EXPLAIN`](explain.html) statement to examine it. It's possible that the query was slow because it performs a full-table scan. In these cases, you can likely improve the query's performance by [adding an index](create-index.html).

*(More guidance around query performance optimization forthcoming.)*
