title: ST_Overlaps
summary: ST_Overlaps(A, B) returns true if the shapes intersect, but neither is contained within the other.

Given two shapes _A_ and _B_, `ST_Overlaps(A, B)` returns `true` if the following criteria are met:

- The shapes share any of the same space -- that is, if any point in the set that comprises _A_ is also a member of the set of points that make up _B_.
- Neither of the shapes is contained by the other, in the [`ST_Contains`](st_contains.html) sense.

In other words, `ST_Overlaps` returns `true` if the shapes intersect (in the [`ST_Intersects`](st_intersects.html) sense), but neither is contained within the other.

`ST_Overlaps` works on the following spatial data types:

- [`GEOMETRY`](spatial-glossary.html#geometry)

{% if page.has_prefixed_variant %}
{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`{{page.title}}` will attempt to use any available [spatial index](spatial-indexes.html) to speed up its operation.  Use the prefixed variant `_{{page.title}}` if you do not want any spatial indexes to be used.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}
{% endif %}

## Examples

{% include {{page.version.version}}/misc/geojson_geometry_note.md %}

### True

In this example, `{{page.title}}` returns `true` because:

- There is a Point in the set that comprises Polygon _A_ that is also a member of the set of Points that make up Polygon _B_.
- Neither of the shapes is contained by the other, in the [`ST_Contains`](st_contains.html) sense.

In this example, `{{page.title}}` returns `false` because:

- - There is not any Point in the set that comprises Polygon _A_ that is also a member of the set of Points that make up Polygon _B_.
