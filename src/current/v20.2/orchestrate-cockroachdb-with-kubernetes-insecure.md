This page shows you how to orchestrate the deployment, management, and monitoring of an insecure 3-node CockroachDB cluster in a single [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) cluster, using the [StatefulSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) feature directly or via the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) Kubernetes package manager.

To deploy across multiple Kubernetes clusters in different geographic regions instead, see [Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Deployment](orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes-multi-cluster.html). Also, for details about potential performance bottlenecks to be aware of when running CockroachDB in Kubernetes and guidance on how to optimize your deployment for better performance, see [CockroachDB Performance on Kubernetes](kubernetes-performance.html).

## Before you begin

Before getting started, it's helpful to review some Kubernetes-specific terminology and current limitations.

- [Kubernetes terminology](#kubernetes-terminology)
- [Limitations](#limitations)

### Kubernetes terminology

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) | A physical or virtual machine. In this tutorial, you'll create GCE or AWS instances and join them as worker nodes into a single Kubernetes cluster from your local workstation.
[pod](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/) | A pod is a group of one or more Docker containers. In this tutorial, each pod will run on a separate Kubernetes node and include one Docker container running a single CockroachDB node. You'll start with 3 pods and grow to 4.
[StatefulSet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) | A StatefulSet is a group of pods treated as stateful units, where each pod has distinguishable network identity and always binds back to the same persistent storage on restart. StatefulSets are considered stable as of Kubernetes version 1.9 after reaching beta in version 1.5.
[persistent volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) | A persistent volume is a piece of networked storage (Persistent Disk on GCE, Elastic Block Store on AWS) mounted into a pod. The lifetime of a persistent volume is decoupled from the lifetime of the pod that's using it, ensuring that each CockroachDB node binds back to the same storage on restart.<br><br>This tutorial assumes that dynamic volume provisioning is available. When that is not the case, [persistent volume claims](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) need to be created manually.

### Limitations

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-limitations.md %}

## Step 1. Start Kubernetes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/start-kubernetes.md %}

## Step 2. Start CockroachDB

To start your CockroachDB cluster, you can either use our StatefulSet configuration and related files directly, or you can use the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager for Kubernetes to simplify the process.

</section>

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="helm">
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/start-cockroachdb-helm-insecure.md %}
</section>

## Step 3. Use the built-in SQL client

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/test-cluster-insecure.md %}

## Step 4. Access the DB Console

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/monitor-cluster.md %}

## Step 5. Simulate node failure

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-simulate-failure.md %}

## Step 6. Monitor the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-prometheus-alertmanager.md %}

## Step 7. Maintain the cluster

- [Remove nodes](#remove-nodes)
- [Expand disk size](#expand-disk-size)
- [Upgrade the cluster](#upgrade-the-cluster)
- [Stop the cluster](#stop-the-cluster)

### Add nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-scale-cluster.md %}

### Remove nodes

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-remove-nodes-insecure.md %}

### Expand disk size

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-expand-disk-size.md %}

### Upgrade the cluster

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/orchestration/kubernetes-upgrade-cluster.md %}

### Stop the cluster

To shut down the CockroachDB cluster:

1. Delete the resources you created, including the logs:

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
    This does not include deleting the persistent volumes that were attached to the pods. If you want to delete the persistent volumes and free up the storage used by CockroachDB, be sure you have a backup copy of your data. Data **cannot** be recovered once the persistent volumes are deleted. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/delete-stateful-set/#persistent-volumes).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

2. Stop Kubernetes:
    - Hosted GKE:

        {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ shell
        $ gcloud container clusters delete cockroachdb --region {region-name}
        ~~~
    - Hosted EKS:

        {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ shell
        $ eksctl delete cluster --name cockroachdb
        ~~~
    - Manual GCE:

        {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ shell
        $ cluster/kube-down.sh
        ~~~
    - Manual AWS:

        {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ shell
        $ cluster/kube-down.sh
        ~~~
