title: Unique Constraint
summary: The UNIQUE constraint specifies that each non-NULL value in the constrained column must be unique.

The `UNIQUE` [constraint](constraints.html) specifies that each non-`NULL` value in the constrained column must be unique.


## Details

- You can insert `NULL` values into columns with the `UNIQUE` constraint because `NULL` is the absence of a value, so it is never equal to other `NULL` values and not considered a duplicate value. This means that it's possible to insert rows that appear to be duplicates if one of the values is `NULL`.

    If you need to strictly enforce uniqueness, use the [`NOT NULL` constraint](not-null.html) in addition to the `UNIQUE` constraint. You can also achieve the same behavior through the table's [Primary Key](primary-key.html).

- Columns with the `UNIQUE` constraint automatically have an [index](indexes.html) created with the name `<table name>_<columns>_key`. To avoid having two identical indexes, you should not create indexes that exactly match the `UNIQUE` constraint's columns and order.

    The `UNIQUE` constraint depends on the automatically created index, so dropping the index also drops the `UNIQUE` constraint.

- When using the `UNIQUE` constraint on multiple columns, the collective values of the columns must be unique. This *does not* mean that each value in each column must be unique, as if you had applied the `UNIQUE` constraint to each column individually.

- You can define the `UNIQUE` constraint when [creating a table](#syntax), or you can add it to existing tables through [`ADD CONSTRAINT`](add-constraint.html#add-the-unique-constraint).

## Syntax

`UNIQUE` constraints can be defined at the [table level](#table-level). However, if you only want the constraint to apply to a single column, it can be applied at the [column level](#column-level).

### Column level

<div>
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/diagrams/unique_column_level.html %}
</div>

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
`table_name` | The name of the table you're creating.
`column_name` | The name of the constrained column.
`column_type` | The constrained column's [data type](data-types.html).
`column_constraints` | Any other column-level [constraints](constraints.html) you want to apply to this column.
`column_def` | Definitions for any other columns in the table.
`table_constraints` | Any table-level [constraints](constraints.html) you want to apply.

**Example**

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE warehouses (
    warehouse_id    INT        PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    warehouse_name  STRING(35) UNIQUE,
    location_id     INT
  );
~~~

### Table level

<div>
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/diagrams/unique_table_level.html %}
</div>

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
`table_name` | The name of the table you're creating.
`column_def` | Definitions for any other columns in the table.
`name` | The name you want to use for the constraint, which must be unique to its table and follow these [identifier rules](keywords-and-identifiers.html#identifiers).
`column_name` | The name of the column you want to constrain.
`table_constraints` | Any other table-level [constraints](constraints.html) you want to apply.

**Example**

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE logon (
    login_id  INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id   INT,
    logon_date    TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE (customer_id, logon_date)
  );
~~~

## Usage example

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logon (
    login_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id   INT NOT NULL,
    sales_id INT,
    UNIQUE (customer_id, sales_id)
  );
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO logon (login_id, customer_id, sales_id) VALUES (1, 2, 1);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO logon (login_id, customer_id, sales_id) VALUES (2, 2, 1);
~~~

~~~
duplicate key value (customer_id,sales_id)=(2,1) violates unique constraint "logon_customer_id_sales_id_key"
~~~

As mentioned in the [details](#details) above, it is possible when using the `UNIQUE` constraint alone to insert *NULL* values in a way that causes rows to appear to have rows with duplicate values.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO logon (login_id, customer_id, sales_id) VALUES (3, 2, NULL);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO logon (login_id, customer_id, sales_id) VALUES (4, 2, NULL);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT customer_id, sales_id FROM logon;
~~~

~~~
+-------------+----------+
| customer_id | sales_id |
+-------------+----------+
|           2 |        1 |
|           2 | NULL     |
|           2 | NULL     |
+-------------+----------+
~~~
