On a secure cluster, this area of the DB Console can only be accessed by an `admin` user. See [DB Console access](ui-overview.html#db-console-access).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<span class="version-tag">New in v20.2:</span> The **Transactions** page helps you:

- Identify frequently retried or high latency transactions.
- View transaction [details](#transaction-details-page).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
In contrast with the [**Statements** page](ui-statements-page.html), which displays [SQL statement fingerprints](ui-statements-page.html#sql-statement-fingerprints), the **Transactions** page displays SQL statement fingerprints grouped by [transaction](transactions.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To view this page, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and click **Transactions** in the left-hand navigation.

## Search and filter by application

By default, this page shows transactions from all applications running on the cluster, and hides internal CockroachDB transactions.

To filter the transactions by [`application_name`](connection-parameters.html#additional-connection-parameters), use the **App** pulldown in the **Filters** menu. If you haven't set `application_name` in the client connection string, it appears as `unset`.

- CockroachDB's internal transactions are only displayed under the `$ internal` app.
- Transactions from the SQL shell are displayed under the `$ cockroach sql` app.

You can also search for transactions using the search bar.

## Filter by transaction latency

You can filter transactions in which a SQL statement fingerprint exceeds a specified latency value. Use the pulldown in the **Filters** menu.

## Understand the Transactions page

Use this page to identify transactions that you may want to [troubleshoot](query-behavior-troubleshooting.html), such as transactions that are experiencing high latencies, multiple [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries), or execution failures.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If you haven't yet run any transactions in the cluster as a user, this page will display a blank table.

Parameter | Description
-----|------------
Transactions | Transaction.<br><br>To view the transaction fingerprint and details, click this to open the [**Transaction Details** page](#transaction-details-page).
Statements | Number of SQL statements in the transaction.
Retries | Cumulative number of [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) of this transaction within the last hour or specified [time interval](ui-statements-page.html#time-interval).
Execution Count | Cumulative number of executions of this transaction within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The bar indicates the ratio of runtime success (gray) to [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) (red) for the transaction.
Rows Affected | Average number of rows returned while executing this transaction within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of rows returned. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Latency | Average service latency of this transaction within the last hour or specified [time interval](#time-interval). This includes the total time the transaction remains open, which can exceed the latency of the SQL statements in the transaction. To view the SQL statement latency for this transaction, see the [**Transaction Details** page](#transaction-details-page). <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean latency. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Significant transactions on your database are likely to have a high execution count or number of rows affected.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Time interval

By default, the Transactions page displays all transactions executed within a one-hour time interval. The display is cleared at the end of each interval. You can change the interval with the [`diagnostics.reporting.interval`](cluster-settings.html#settings) cluster setting.

## Transaction Details page

Click on a transaction fingerprint to open **Transaction Details**.

The *transaction fingerprint* is displayed as a list of the individual [SQL statement fingerprints](ui-statements-page.html#sql-statement-fingerprints) in the transaction:

<img src="{{ 'images/v20.2/ui-transactions-details-page.png' | relative_url }}" alt="DB Console Statements Page" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

The following details are also displayed for the SQL statements in the transaction:

Parameter | Description
-----|------------
Statement | SQL statement [fingerprint](ui-statements-page.html#sql-statement-fingerprints).<br><br>To view additional details of a SQL statement fingerprint, click this to open the [**Statement Details** page](ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page).
Txn Type | Type of transaction (implicit or explicit). Explicit transactions refer to statements that are wrapped by [`BEGIN`](begin-transaction.html) and [`COMMIT`](commit-transaction.html) statements by the client. Explicit transactions employ [transactional pipelining](architecture/transaction-layer.html#transaction-pipelining) and therefore report latencies that do not account for replication.<br><br>For statements not in explicit transactions, CockroachDB wraps each statement in individual implicit transactions.
Retries | Cumulative number of [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) of statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](ui-statements-page.html#time-interval).
Execution Count | Cumulative number of executions of statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](ui-statements-page.html#time-interval). <br><br>The bar indicates the ratio of runtime success (gray) to [retries](transactions.html#transaction-retries) (red) for the SQL statement fingerprint.
Rows Affected | Average number of rows returned while executing statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](ui-statements-page.html#time-interval). <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of rows returned. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
Latency | Average service latency of statements with this fingerprint within the last hour or specified [time interval](ui-statements-page.html#time-interval). This includes the time taken to execute a query once it is received by the cluster. It does not include the time taken to send the query to the cluster or return the result to the client. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean latency. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean.
