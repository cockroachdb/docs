## Description

In all versions of CockroachDB v23.1, v23.2.0 to v23.2.9, v24.1.0 to v24.1.3, and testing versions of v24.2 through v24.2.0-beta.3, [changefeeds]({% link v24.2/change-data-capture-overview.md %}) could emit events on the same row out of order in some cases, which violates [changefeed ordering guarantees]({% link v24.2/changefeed-messages.md %}#per-key-ordering). This issue was caused by a [bug in the sarama Kafka client library](https://github.com/IBM/sarama/issues/2619), a third-party library that CockroachDB uses to talk to Kafka clusters. The bug manifested when a workload had mutations to the same key in rapid succession, because it was possible for [sarama](https://github.com/IBM/sarama) to re-order the messages if it encountered a retryable Kafka error.

To resolve this issue, CockroachDB now uses a new version of the Kafka sink that uses [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go), a different third-party Kafka client library that does not have this bug. The new Kafka sink can be enabled using the cluster setting [`changefeed.new_kafka_sink.enabled`]({% link v24.2/show-cluster-setting.md %}). The new Kafka sink was added in PR [#126213](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/126213).

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by PR [#126213](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/126213), which replaces the Kafka client library [sarama](https://github.com/IBM/sarama) with [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go).

The fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB v23.2.10, v24.1.4, and v24.2.0-rc.1.

This public issue is tracked by issue [#122372](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/122372).

## Mitigation

Users of CockroachDB v23.1, v23.2.0 to v23.2.9, v24.1.0 to v24.1.3, and testing versions of v24.2 through v24.2.0-beta.3 are encouraged to upgrade to [v23.2.10]({% link releases/v23.2.md %}#v23-2-10), [v24.1.4]({% link releases/v24.1.md %}#v24-1-4), [v24.2.0]({% link releases/v24.2.md %}#v24-2-0), or a later version, and enable the cluster setting [`changefeed.new_kafka_sink.enabled`]({% link v24.2/show-cluster-setting.md %}):

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING changefeed.new_kafka_sink.enabled = true;
~~~

`changefeed.new_kafka_sink.enabled` will be enabled by default in versions v24.2.1, v24.3, and all later versions.

## Impact

Changefeeds could emit events on the same row out of order in some cases, violating the [changefeed ordering guarantee]({% link v24.2/changefeed-messages.md %}#per-key-ordering). Versions affected include CockroachDB v23.1, v23.2.0 to v23.2.9, v24.1.0 to v24.1.3, and testing versions of v24.2 through v24.2.0-beta.3.
