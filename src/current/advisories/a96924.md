## Description

While executing [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](../stable/alter-table.html) on a column used in a partial index, all DML statements referencing the table fail with an error during the delete-only phase of the `ALTER`, which can last several hours for large tables. This includes [`SELECT`](../stable/selection-queries.html), [`INSERT`](../stable/insert.html), [`UPSERT`](../stable/upsert.html), [`UPDATE`](../stable/update.html), and [`DELETE`](../stable/delete.html) statements.

This problem exists in all versions of CockroachDB since the introduction of [partial indexes](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/partial-indexes.html) in [v20.2.0](../releases/v20.2.html#v20-2-0).

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by [#97372](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/97372), which disallows dropping columns that are referenced by a partial index.

This fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB [v22.1.16](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-16) and [v22.2.6](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-6)).

This public issue is tracked by [#96924](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/96924).

## Mitigation

Users can avoid the issue by [dropping any partial indexes](../stable/drop-index.html) using the column before [dropping the column](../stable/alter-table.html).

Users of CockroachDB [v21.2.0](../releases/v21.2.html#v21-2-0) through [v22.1.15](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-15) and [v22.2.0](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0) through [v22.2.5](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-5) are encouraged to upgrade to [v22.1.16](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-16), [v22.2.6](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-6), or a later version.

## Impact

When executing [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](../stable/alter-table.html) of a column used in a partial index, all DML statements referencing the table fail with an error during the delete-only phase. DML statements not referencing the table are not affected.
