## Description

While executing [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/alter-table) on a column used in a partial index, all DML statements referencing the table fail with an error during the delete-only phase of the `ALTER`, which can last several hours for large tables. This includes [`SELECT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/selection-queries), [`INSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/insert), [`UPSERT`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/upsert), [`UPDATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/update), and [`DELETE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/delete) statements.

This problem exists in all versions of CockroachDB since the introduction of [partial indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/partial-indexes) in [v20.2.0](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v20.2#v20-2-0).

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by [#97372](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/97372), which disallows dropping columns that are referenced by a partial index.

This fix has been applied to maintenance releases of CockroachDB [v22.1.16](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.1#v22-1-16) and [v22.2.6](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.2#v22-2-6)).

This public issue is tracked by [#96924](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/96924).

## Mitigation

Users can avoid the issue by [dropping any partial indexes](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/drop-index) using the column before [dropping the column](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/alter-table#drop-column).

Users of CockroachDB [v21.2.0](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v21.2#v21-2-0) through [v22.1.15](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.1#v22-1-15) and [v22.2.0](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.2#v22-2-0) through [v22.2.5](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.2#v22-2-5) are encouraged to upgrade to [v22.1.16](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.1#v22-1-16), [v22.2.6](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.2#v22-2-6), or a later version.

## Impact

When executing [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/alter-table#drop-column) of a column used in a partial index, all DML statements referencing the table fail with an error during the delete-only phase. DML statements not referencing the table are not affected.
