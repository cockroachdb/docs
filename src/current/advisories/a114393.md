## Description

A critical bug has been identified in the [optimizer](../v23.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) that may lead to incorrect query results, affecting queries involving [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v23.1/regional-tables.html#regional-by-row-tables). The bug can cause rows in the local region of a `REGIONAL BY ROW` table to be omitted from query results when performing a [locality-optimized](../v23.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters) [lookup join](../v23.1/joins.html#lookup-joins). The bug manifests under the following conditions:

- The query includes at least one join operation, either explicitly with the JOIN keyword or implicitly, for example, a correlated subquery.
- The query fetches data from a `REGIONAL BY ROW` table.
- Additional non-join related filters are present, such as equality (or inequality) conditions with constant values.

## Statement

This is resolved in CockroachDB by [#114394](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/114394).

This fix has been applied to maintenance release of CockroachDB [v23.1.13](../releases/v23.1.html#v23-1-13), which fixes a bug that could cause a query plan to skip scanning rows from the local region when performing a lookup join with a `REGIONAL BY ROW` table as the input.

This public issue is tracked by [#114393](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/114393).

## Mitigation

Users running affected versions in multi-region clusters are encouraged to upgrade to [v23.1.13](../releases/v23.1.html#v23-1-13) or a later version.

Without upgrading, the bug can only be prevented by disabling locality-optimized search with the session setting: `SET locality_optimized_partitioned_index_scan=off`. Note that this will increase the latency for some queries involving `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables.

## Impact

Versions affected include v23.1.0 to v23.1.12, and pre-release versions v23.1.0-beta.1, v23.1.0-beta.2, v23.1.0-beta.3, v23.1.0-rc.1, and v23.1.0-rc.2.
