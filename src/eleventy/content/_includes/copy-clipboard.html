Copy-clipboard buttons are now added dynamically by JavaScript in customscripts.js.
This include is kept empty for backward compatibility with unmigrated content that
still calls {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %} or {% include copy-clipboard.html %}.
The client-side JS finds all code blocks and adds the copy button properly.
