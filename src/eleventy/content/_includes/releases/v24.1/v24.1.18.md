<h3 id="v24-1-18-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statements now display the number of transaction retries and time spent retrying, if non-zero, in the plan output.
 [#142931][#142931]
- Added the `WITH IGNORE_FOREIGN_KEYS` option to `SHOW CREATE TABLE` which omits foreign key constraints from the output schema. This option is also allowed in `SHOW CREATE VIEW`, but has no effect. It cannot be combined with the `WITH REDACT` option.

<h3 id="v24-1-18-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare corruption bug that impacts import and materialized views. [#144689][#144689]
- Fixed a bug that caused changefeeds to fail on startup when scanning a single key.
 [#143148][#143148]
- Fixed a bug in the client certificate expiration metrics `security.certificate.expiration.client` and `security.certificate.ttl.client`.
 [#142915][#142915]
- Fixed a bug in v24.1.14, v24.3.7, v24.3.8, and v25.1 that could cause a nil-pointer error when a column's default expression contained a volatile expression (like `nextval`) as a UDF argument.
 [#143638][#143638]
- MVCC garbage collection is now fully subject to IO admission control. Previously, it was possible for MVCC GC to cause store overload (such as LSM inversion) when a large amount of data would become eligible for garbage collection. Should any issues arise from subjecting MVCC GC to admission control, the `kv.mvcc_gc.queue_kv_admission_control.enabled` cluster setting can be set to `false` to restore the previous behavior.
 [#143275][#143275]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a stack overflow during execution of a prepared statement that invoked a PL/pgSQL routine with a loop. The bug existed in versions v23.2.22, v24.1.15, v24.3.9, v25.1.2, v25.1.3, and pre-release versions of v25.2 prior to v25.2.0-alpha.3.
 [#144035][#144035]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would encounter an internal error when decoding the gists of plans with `CALL` statements. The bug had been present since v23.2.
 [#143313][#143313]
- Fixed a bug where calling a stored procedure could drop the procedure if it had `OUT` parameters that were not used by the calling routine. This bug had existed since PL/pgSQL `CALL` statements were introduced in v24.1.
 [#143288][#143288]
- Previously, the fields `maximum memory usage` and `max sql temp disk usage` in the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output could be under-reported for distributed plans when memory-intensive operations were fully performed on the remote nodes. This is now fixed. The bug existed in v22.1 and later.
