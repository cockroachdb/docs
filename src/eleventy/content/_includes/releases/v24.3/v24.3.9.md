## v24.3.9

Release Date: April 2, 2025

{% include "releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md", release: include.release %}

<h3 id="v24-3-9-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `WITH IGNORE_FOREIGN_KEYS` option to `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, which omits foreign key constraints from the output schema. This option is also allowed in `SHOW CREATE VIEW`, but has no effect. It cannot be combined with the `WITH REDACT` option.
 [#143368][#143368]

<h3 id="v24-3-9-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the `sql.transaction_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the transaction timeout.
 [#142156][#142156]
- Added the `sql.statement_timeout.count` to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the statement timeout.
 [#142156][#142156]
- The `server.client_cert_expiration_cache.capacity` cluster setting has been removed. The `security.certificate.expiration.client` and `security.certificate.ttl.client` metrics now report the lowest value observed for a user in the last 24 hours.
 [#143593][#143593]

<h3 id="v24-3-9-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented starting multi-table Logical Data Replication (LDR) streams on tables that used user-defined types.
 [#141793][#141793]
- The TTL deletion job now includes a retry mechanism that progressively reduces the batch size when encountering contention. This improves the chances of successful deletion without requiring manual adjustments to TTL knobs. Also added the `jobs.row_level_ttl.num_delete_batch_retries` metric to track the number of times the TTL job had to reduce the batch size and try again.
 [#142323][#142323]
- Fixed a bug when running with the `autocommit_before_ddl` session setting that could cause a runtime error when binding a previously prepared DDL statement.
 [#141987][#141987]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate casts to some OID types (like `REGCLASS`) in some cases. The bug had been present since at least v22.1.
 [#141958][#141958]
- Fixed a bug that could cause gateway nodes to panic when performing an `UPSERT` on a table with a `BOOL` primary key column and a partial index with the primary key column as the predicate expression.
 [#141823][#141823]
- Fixed a bug that would prevent the `CREATE TRIGGER` and `DROP TRIGGER` statements from working if the `autocommit_before_ddl` setting was enabled, and if the statement was either sent as a prepared statement or as part of a batch of multiple statements.
 [#142303][#142303]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `SHOW TABLES` and other introspection operations to encounter a `batch timestamp must be after replica GC threshold` error. [#141720][#141720]
- Fixed a bug where Physical Cluster Replication (PCR) reader catalogs could have orphaned rows in `system.namespace` after an object is renamed. [#142873][#142873]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `nil pointer dereference` errors when executing statements with user-defined functions (UDFs). The error could also occur when executing statements with some built-in functions, like `obj_description`.
 [#141652][#141652]
- Fixed a bug in `v24.1.14`, `v24.3.7`, `v24.3.8`, and `v25.1` that could cause a nil-pointer error when a column's default expression contained a volatile expression (like `nextval`) as a UDF argument.
 [#143635][#143635]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent `SHOW CREATE TABLE` from working if a database was offline (e.g., due to a `RESTORE` on that database).
 [#141509][#141509]
- Fixed an issue where dropping a database with triggers could fail due to an undropped backreference to a trigger function.
 [#142726][#142726]
- Fixed a bug where the declarative schema changer allowed `CREATE SEQUENCE` operations to proceed even while a `DROP SCHEMA` or `DROP DATABASE` was in progress. Such operations now retry if the parent object has a schema change in progress, preventing new child objects from being created under deleted parent objects.
 [#142763][#142763]
- Fixed a potential deadlock that could occur during client certificate updates while metrics were being collected. This issue affected the reliability of certificate expiration reporting.
 [#143593][#143593]
- Fixed a bug where the fraction completed and internal checkpoints during an index backfill operation would stop getting written if any of the periodic fraction/checkpoint write operations failed. Progress is now logged in addition to being written to the job record. This bug affected schema change operations such as creating an index or adding a non-nullable column to a table.
 [#141787][#141787]
- Fixed a crash due to `use of enum metadata before hydration` when using logical data replication (LDR) with user-defined types.
 [#143389][#143389]

<h3 id="v24-3-9-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- When configuring the `sql.ttl.default_delete_rate_limit` cluster setting, a notice is now displayed informing the user that the TTL rate limit is per leaseholder per table with a [link to the docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/dev/row-level-ttl).
 [#142833][#142833]
- Improved S3 credential caching for AWS Security Token Service (STS) credentials. [#142437][#142437]
