Release Date: October 17, 2025

<h3 id="v25-3-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the cluster setting `kvadmission.use_range_tenant_id_for_non_admin.enabled`, which can be used to disable the behavior where admission control uses the range's tenant ID for non-admin requests. This behavior is disabled by default. [#153460][#153460]

<h3 id="v25-3-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where an `INSERT` statement could fail with a type checking error while adding a `BIT(n)` column. [#152965][#152965]
- Fixed a bug where index creation could fail due to validation errors if the schema change was retried or paused/resumed during the backfill. [#153597][#153597]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v25.1.0 that would cause a node panic if a `SIGINT` signal was sent during the execution of a `CHECK EXTERNAL CONNECTION` command. [#153602][#153602]
- Fixed a bug where `ALTER POLICY` was incorrectly dropping dependency tracking for functions, sequences, or types in policy expressions. [#153804][#153804]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v25.1 where CockroachDB nodes could crash when executing `DO` statements that referenced (possibly nonexistent) user-defined types in non-default configurations. The crash only occurred if additional logging was enabled (for example, with the `sql.log.all_statements.enabled` cluster setting). [#153913][#153913]
- Fixed a runtime error that could be hit if a new secondary index had a name collision with a primary index. [#154016][#154016]
- Fixed a bug where the `schema_locked` storage parameter was not being enforced on the `TRUNCATE` command, which could cause changefeed jobs to fail. [#154041][#154041]
- Fixed a bug that caused panics when executing `COPY` into a table with hidden columns and expression indexes. The panic only occurred when the session setting `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` was enabled. This bug was introduced with `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` in v22.1.0. [#154286][#154286]
- Disabled the `kv.lock_table.unreplicated_lock_reliability.split.enabled` feature, which could lead to a node crash. [#155414][#155414]
- Fixed a bug where the presence of duplicate temporary tables in a backup caused the restore to fail with an error containing the text `restoring table desc and namespace entries: table already exists`. [#154397][#154397]
