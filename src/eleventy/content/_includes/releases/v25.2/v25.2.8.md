- In order to selectively capture traces for transactions running in an active workload without having to capture them via statement diagnostic bundles, customers can now use the `sql.trace.txn.sample_rate` cluster setting to enable tracing for a fraction of their workload. The `sql.trace.txn.enable_threshold` will still need to be set to a positive value to provide a filter for how slow a transaction needs to be after being sampled to merit emitting a trace. Traces are emitted to the `SQL_EXEC` logging channel. [#156409][#156409]

- Fixed a bug in the `cockroach node drain` command where draining a node using virtual clusters (such as clusters running Physical Cluster Replication (PCR)) could return before the drain was complete, possibly resulting in shutting down the node while it still had active SQL clients and range leases.
