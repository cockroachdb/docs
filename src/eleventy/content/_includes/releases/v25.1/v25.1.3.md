## v25.1.3

Release Date: April 2, 2025

{% include "releases/new-release-downloads-docker-image.md", release: include.release %}

<h3 id="v25-1-3-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- When changefeeds are created with a `resolved` option lower than the `min_checkpoint_frequency` option, a message was printed to inform the user. This message is now a notice, and includes extra information if either option was a default.
 [#142154][#142154]

<h3 id="v25-1-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the cluster setting `server.child_metrics.include_aggregate.enabled` (default: `true`) that controls the behavior of Prometheus child metrics reporting (`/_status/vars`). When set to `true`, child metrics include an aggregate time series, maintaining the existing behavior. When set to `false`, it stops reporting the aggregate time series, preventing double counting when querying metrics.
 [#142746][#142746]
- Added the `sql.statement_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the statement timeout.
 [#142155][#142155]
- Added the `sql.transaction_timeout.count` metric to track the number of SQL statements that fail due to exceeding the transaction timeout.

<h3 id="v25-1-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a crash due to `use of enum metadata before hydration` when using logical data replication (LDR) with user-defined types.
 [#143388][#143388]
- Fixed an issue where dropping a database with triggers could fail due to an undropped backreference to a trigger function.
 [#142727][#142727]
- Fixed a bug in `v24.1.14`, `v24.3.7`, `v24.3.8`, and `v25.1` that could cause a nil-pointer error when a column's default expression contained a volatile expression (like `nextval`) as a UDF argument.
 [#143632][#143632]
- A step in the 25.1 upgrade finalization process that required backfilling jobs now uses locks to ensure it makes progress even when there is contention on the jobs table to prevent the possibility of becoming stuck under heavy load.
 [#142223][#142223]
- Fixed a bug where the declarative schema changer allowed `CREATE SEQUENCE` operations to proceed even while a `DROP SCHEMA` or `DROP DATABASE` was in progress. Such operations now retry if the parent object has a schema change in progress, preventing new child objects from being created under deleted parent objects.
 [#142764][#142764]
- Fixed a bug when running with the `autocommit_before_ddl` session variable that could cause a runtime error when binding a previously prepared DDL statement.
 [#141851][#141851]
- Fixed a bug that would prevent `CREATE TRIGGER` and `DROP TRIGGER` statements from working if the `autocommit_before_ddl` setting was enabled, and if the statement was either sent as a prepared statement or as part of a batch of multiple statements.
 [#142302][#142302]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate casts to some OID types (like `REGCLASS`) in some cases. The bug had been present since at least v22.1.
 [#141956][#141956]
- Fixed a bug where replication controls on indexes and partitions would not get properly updated with their new IDs during index backfills, effectively discarding the replication controls set on them before the backfill.
 [#142844][#142844]
- Fixed a bug where `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output could incorrectly show `distribution: full` and not `distribution: local` in some cases when the physical plan was only running on the gateway node. The bug had been present since before v23.1, and did not apply to `EXPLAIN` statements.
 [#142938][#142938]
- The TTL deletion job now includes a retry mechanism that progressively reduces the batch size when encountering contention. This improves the chances of successful deletion without requiring manual adjustments to TTL knobs. Also added the `jobs.row_level_ttl.num_delete_batch_retries` metric to track the number of times the TTL job had to reduce the batch size and try again.
 [#142324][#142324]
- Fixed a bug where the fraction completed and internal checkpoints during an index backfill operation would stop getting written if any of the periodic fraction/checkpoint write operations failed. Additional logging was added so that progress is logged in addition to being written to the job record. This bug affected schema change operations such as creating an index or adding a non-nullable column to a table.
 [#141788][#141788]
- Fixed a bug which would send a replica outside of a tenant's known region when `SURVIVE REGION FAILURE` was set and exactly 3 regions were configured.
 [#142980][#142980]
- Fixed a bug that could cause the upgrade to v25.1 to crash if a job was missing from the virtual table. For example, if a malformed job had no payload information.
 [#142311][#142311]
- Fixed a bug where during validation of a table-level zone config, inherited values were incorrectly populated from the default range instead of from the parent database.
 [#142865][#142865]
- Fixed a bug in client certificate expiration metrics, `security.certificate.expiration.client` and `security.certificate.ttl.client`.
 [#142916][#142916]
- Fixed a bug where a node that was drained as part of decommissioning may have interrupted SQL connections that were still active during drain (and for which drain would have been expected to wait).
 [#141769][#141769]
- Physical Cluster Replication (PCR) reader catalogs could have orphaned rows in `system.namespace` after an object is renamed.
 [#142872][#142872]

<h3 id="v25-1-3-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- Updated the `CREATE TRIGGER` `only implemented in the declarative schema changer` error message to include a helpful suggestion and link to relevant docs.
 [#141872][#141872]
- When configuring the `sql.ttl.default_delete_rate_limit` cluster setting, a notice is displayed informing the user that the TTL rate limit is per leaseholder per table with a link to the docs.
 [#142834][#142834]
- When configuring the `sql.ttl.default_delete_rate_limit` cluster setting, a notice is displayed informing the user that the TTL rate limit is per leaseholder per table with a link to the docs.
 [#142834][#142834]
- Improved S3 credential caching for STS credentials to avoid exceeding the Amazon metadata service rate limit and encountering errors related to AssumeRole API calls when accessing large numbers of files in larger clusters.
