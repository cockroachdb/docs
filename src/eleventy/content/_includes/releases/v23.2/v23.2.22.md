<h3 id="v23-2-22-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause gateway nodes to panic when performing an `UPSERT` on a table with a `BOOL` primary key column and a partial index that used the primary key column as the predicate expression.
 [#141825][#141825]
- Fixed a rare bug in which a query could fail with the error `could not find computed column expression for column in table` while dropping a virtual computed column from a table. This bug was introduced in v23.2.4.
 [#139874][#139874]
- Fixed a bug that could cause `nil pointer dereference` errors when executing statements with user-defined functions (UDFs). The error could also occur when executing statements with some built-in functions, like `obj_description`.

- When configuring the `sql.ttl.default_delete_rate_limit` cluster setting, a notice is displayed informing the user that the TTL rate limit is per leaseholder per table with a link to the docs.
