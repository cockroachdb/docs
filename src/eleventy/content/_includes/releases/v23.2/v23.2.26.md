<h3 id="v23-2-26-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where using values for the cluster setting `changefeed.aggregator.flush_jitter` and the changefeed option `min_checkpoint_frequency` resulting in `changefeed.aggregator.flush_jitter * min_checkpoint_frequency < 1` would cause a panic. Jitter will now be disabled in this case. [#144423][#144423]
- Improved the performance of `SHOW CREATE TABLE` on multi-region databases with a large numbers of objects. [#145081][#145081]
- Fixed an internal assertion failure that could occur during operations like `ALTER TYPE` or `ALTER DATABASE ... ADD REGION` when temporary tables were present. [#146200][#146200]
- Fixed a bug that prevented `TRUNCATE` from succeeding if any indexes on the table had back-reference dependencies, such as from a view or function referencing the index. [#146322][#146322]
- Fixed a rare corruption bug that impacts import and materialized views. [#144659][#144659]
