    The {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}**Folder Admin**{% else %}[**Folder Admin**]({% link "cockroachcloud/authorization.md" %}#folder-admin){% endif %} role allows users to create, rename, move, delete, and manage access to folders where they are assigned the role. Users can also [edit folder labels]({% link "cockroachcloud/labels.md" %}). This role can be assigned at the level of the organization or on a specific folder. If assigned at the level of the organization, the role allows users to view all users and service accounts in the organization. If assigned to a specific folder, the role is inherited by descendant folders.

    A user with the {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}[Organization Admin](#organization-admin){% else %}[Organization Admin]({% link "cockroachcloud/authorization.md" %}#organization-admin){% endif %} role can assign themselves, another user, or a service account the Folder Admin role.

    To create or manage clusters in a folder, a Folder Admin also needs the {% if page.name == 'authorization.md' %}[Cluster Admin](#cluster-admin) or [Cluster Creator](#cluster-creator){% else %}[Cluster Admin]({% link "cockroachcloud/authorization.md" %}#cluster-admin) or [Cluster Creator]({% link "cockroachcloud/authorization.md" %}#cluster-creator){% endif %} role on that folder directly or by inheritance. To delete a cluster, the Cluster Admin role is required on the cluster directly or by inheritance.
