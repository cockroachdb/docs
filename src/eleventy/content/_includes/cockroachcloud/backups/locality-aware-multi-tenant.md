CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.basic }} and {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters operate with a different architecture compared to CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.core }} and CockroachDB {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters. These architectural differences have implications for how locality-aware backups can run. {{ site.data.products.basic }} and {{ site.data.products.standard }} clusters will scale resources depending on whether they are actively in use, which means that it is less likely to have a SQL pod available in every locality. As a result, your cluster may not have a SQL pod in the locality where the data resides, which can lead to the cluster uploading that data to a storage bucket in a locality where you do have active SQL pods. You should consider this as you plan a backup strategy that must comply with [data domiciling]({% link "{{site.current_cloud_version}}/data-domiciling.md" %}) requirements.
