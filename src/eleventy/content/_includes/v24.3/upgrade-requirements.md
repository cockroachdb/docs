CockroachDB v24.3 is a Regular release. To upgrade to it, you must be running either:

- [v24.2]({% link "v24.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.md" %}), the previous Innovation release.
- [v24.1]({% link "v24.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.md" %}), the previous Regular release.

If your cluster is running an earlier version, upgrade to one of these versions before proceeding.
