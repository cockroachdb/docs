This page provides an overview of the backup and restore features available in CockroachDB:

- [Backup and restore types](#backup-and-restore-types) and their product availability
- [SQL statements](#backup-and-restore-sql-statements) for working with backups and restores
- [Storage](#backup-storage) for backups

You can create full or incremental backups of a [cluster](backup.html#backup-a-cluster), [database](backup.html#backup-a-database), or [table](backup.html#backup-a-table-or-view). Taking regular backups of your data is an operational best practice.

## Backup and restore types

The following table outlines the available backup and restore types in CockroachDB. See each of the pages linked in the table for usage examples:

Backup / Restore Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Backup and restore SQL statements

[`ALTER BACKUP`](alter-backup.html) | Add a new [KMS encryption key](take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html#use-key-management-service) to an encrypted backup.

## Backup storage

We recommend taking backups to [cloud storage](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html) and enabling object locking to protect the validity of your backups. CockroachDB supports Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage for backups. Read the following usage information:

- [Example file URLs](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#example-file-urls) to form the URL that you pass to `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` statements.
- [Authentication](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#authentication) to set up authentication to a cloud storage bucket and include those credentials in the URL.

For detail on additional cloud storage features CockroachDB supports:

- [Object locking](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#object-locking) to prevent backups from being overwritten or deleted.
- [Storage Class (AWS S3 only)](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#amazon-s3-storage-classes) to set a specific storage class for your backups.
