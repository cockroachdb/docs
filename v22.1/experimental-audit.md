title: EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT
summary: Use the EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT subcommand to turn SQL audit logging on or off for a table.
toc: true

---

`EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT` is a subcommand of [`ALTER TABLE`](alter-table.html). When applied to a table, it enables or disables the recording of SQL audit events to the [`SENSITIVE_ACCESS`](logging.html#sensitive_access) logging channel for that table.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The `SENSITIVE_ACCESS` log output is also called the SQL audit log. See [SQL Audit Logging](sql-audit-logging.html) for a detailed example.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

SQL audit logs contain detailed information about queries being executed against your system, including:

- Full text of the query (which may include personally identifiable information (PII))
- Date/Time
- Client address
- Application name

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
For descriptions of all SQL audit event types and their fields, see [Notable Event Types](eventlog.html#sql-access-audit-events).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

CockroachDB stores audit log information in a way that ensures durability, but negatively impacts performance. As a result, we recommend using SQL audit logs for security purposes only. For more information, see [Performance considerations](#performance-considerations).

## Synopsis

<div>
{% remote_include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/generated-diagrams/{{ page.release_info.crdb_branch_name }}/grammar_svg/experimental_audit.html %}
</div>

## Required privileges

Only members of the `admin` role can enable audit logs on a table. By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.

## Parameters

 Parameter    | Description
--------------+----------------------------------------------------------
 `table_name` | The name of the table you want to create audit logs for.
 `READ`       | Log all table reads to the audit log file.
 `WRITE`      | Log all table writes to the audit log file.
 `OFF`        | Turn off audit logging.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
This command logs all reads and writes, and both the <code>READ</code> and <code>WRITE</code> parameters are required (as shown in the <a href="#examples">examples</a> below). In a future release, this should change to allow logging only reads, only writes, or both.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Audit log file format

Audit log messages, like all [log messages](logging-overview.html), consist of two sections:

- A payload that contains notable events structured in JSON. These can include information such as the application name, full text of the query (which may contain PII), user account that triggered the event, number of rows produced (e.g., for `SELECT`) or processed (e.g., for `INSERT` or `UPDATE`), status of the query, and more. For more information on the possible event types logged to the `SENSITIVE_ACCESS` channel, see [Notable Event Types](eventlog.html#sql-access-audit-events).
- An envelope that contains event metadata (e.g., severity, date, timestamp, channel). Depending on the log format you specify when [configuring logs](configure-logs.html), the envelope can be formatted either as JSON or as a flat prefix to the message.

## Audit log file storage location

By [default](configure-logs.html#default-logging-configuration), audit logs are prefixed `cockroach-sql-audit` and are stored in the [same directory](configure-logs.html#logging-directory) as the other logs generated by CockroachDB.

To store the audit log files in a specific directory, [configure the `SENSITIVE_ACCESS` channel](configure-logs.html#output-to-files) with a custom `dir` path.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
If your deployment requires particular lifecycle and access policies for audit log files, point `SENSITIVE_ACCESS` to a directory that has permissions set so that only CockroachDB can create/delete files.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Performance considerations

To ensure [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) in audit logs, we recommend [enabling `auditable`](configure-logs.html#configure-log-sinks) for the `SENSITIVE_ACCESS` channel. CockroachDB will then synchronously log all of the activity of every user on a cluster in a way that is durable to system failures. Note that every query that causes a logging event must access the disk of the node on which audit logging is enabled. As a result, enabling `auditable` on a logging channel negatively impacts performance, and we recommend using this setting for security purposes only.

For debugging and troubleshooting on production clusters, the most performant way to log all queries is to enable the `SQL_EXEC` logging channel. For details, see [Logging Use Cases](logging-use-cases.html#sql_exec).

## Examples

### Turn on audit logging

Let's say you have a  `customers` table that contains personally identifiable information (PII). To turn on audit logs for that table, run the following command:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
ALTER TABLE customers EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET READ WRITE;
~~~

Now, every access of customer data is logged to the `SENSITIVE_ACCESS` channel in a [`sensitive_table_access`](eventlog.html#sensitive_table_access) event that looks like the following:

~~~
I210323 18:50:10.951550 1182 8@util/log/event_log.go:32 ⋮ [n1,client=‹[::1]:49851›,hostnossl,user=root] 4 ={"Timestamp":1616525410949087000,"EventType":"sensitive_table_access","Statement":"‹SELECT * FROM \"\".\"\".customers›","User":"‹root›","DescriptorID":52,"ApplicationName":"‹$ cockroach sql›","ExecMode":"exec","NumRows":2,"Age":2.514,"FullTableScan":true,"TxnCounter":38,"TableName":"‹defaultdb.public.customers›","AccessMode":"r"}
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The above example shows the default [`crdb-v2`](log-formats.html#format-crdb-v2) log format. This can be changed to a different format (e.g., JSON). For details, see [Configure Logs](configure-logs.html#file-logging-format).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
For descriptions of all SQL audit event types and their fields, see [Notable Event Types](eventlog.html#sql-access-audit-events).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To turn on auditing for more than one table, issue a separate `ALTER` statement for each table.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
For a more detailed example, see [SQL Audit Logging](sql-audit-logging.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Turn off audit logging

To turn off logging, issue the following command:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
ALTER TABLE customers EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET OFF;
~~~
