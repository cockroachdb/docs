The **Advanced Debug** page of the DB Console provides links to advanced monitoring and troubleshooting reports and cluster configuration details. To view this page, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and click **Advanced Debug** in the left-hand navigation.

## License and node information

On the right-side of the page, the following information is displayed:

- [**License type**](licensing-faqs.html): Determines if you have access to Enterprise features.
- **Web server**: Allows you to route DB Console access from the currently accessed node to a specific node on the cluster. Afterward, identifies the node to which DB Console access is being routed. To cancel this behavior, click **Reset**.

## Reports

The following debug reports are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting CockroachDB:
