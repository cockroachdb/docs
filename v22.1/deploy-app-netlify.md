This tutorial shows you how to deploy a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) web application that communicates with a {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster.

The sample app used in this tutorial simulates [a gaming leaderboard](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/react-typescript-cockroachdb-sample-app/). The [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) used for the app are written in TypeScript. The functions use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to connect to CockroachDB. The app's frontend, also written in TypeScript, uses React, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The source code for the completed app is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-typescript](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-typescript).

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, do the following:

1. Create a [{{ site.data.products.db }}](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup?referralId={{page.referral_id}}) account.

1. Create a Starter [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) account. You can do this with your GitHub login credentials.

## Step 1. Create a {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster

{% include cockroachcloud/quickstart/create-a-free-cluster.md %}

<a name="connection-string"></a>

After the cluster is created, the **Connection info** window appears. Click the **Connection string** tab and copy the connection string to a secure location. You will use this connection string to connect to CockroachDB later in the tutorial.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The connection string is pre-populated with your username, cluster name, and other details, including your password. Your password, in particular, will be provided only once. Save it in a secure place (we recommend a password manager) to connect to your cluster in the future. If you forget your password, you can reset it by going to the [**SQL Users** page](../cockroachcloud/user-authorization.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 2. Get the code

1. Clone the code's GitHub repo:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:cockroachdb/cockroachdb-typescript.git
    ~~~

    The project has the following directory structure:

    ~~~
    ├── LICENSE.md
    ├── README.md
    ├── netlify
    │   └── functions
    │       ├── addScore.ts
    │       ├── getPlayers.ts
    │       └── getScores.ts
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── prisma
    │   ├── schema.prisma
    │   └── seed.ts
    ├── public
    ├── src
    └── tsconfig.json
    ~~~

    In this tutorial, we focus on the files in the `netlify` and `prisma` directories.

1. At the top of the repo directory, fork the repo:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ gh repo fork --remote
    ~~~

    To deploy your code to Netlify, you need to have your own repo or your own fork of the existing repo.

## Step 3. Initialize the database

1. In the `.env` file in your project, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to [the connection string](#connection-string) you obtained earlier from the {{ site.data.products.db }} Console:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ text
    DATABASE_URL=<connection-string>
    ~~~

    Prisma loads the variables defined in `.env` to the project environment.

1. Install Prisma:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    npm install prisma --save-dev
    ~~~

1. Run [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) to initialize the database with the schema defined in `prisma/prisma.schema`.

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ~~~

    You should see the following output:

    ~~~
    Your database is now in sync with your schema.
    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (3.11.0 | library) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 87ms

    Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...
    {
      test_player_1: { id: 1n, name: 'Test Player 1', email: 'test_player_1@example.com' },
      test_player_2: { id: 2n, name: 'Test Player 2', email: 'test_player_2@example.com' },
      test_player_3: { id: 3n, name: 'Test Player 3', email: 'test_player_3@example.com' }
    }

    🌱  The seed command has been executed.
    ~~~

    This command initializes [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) to communicate with your CockroachDB cluster, based on the configuration in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file. The command also seeds your database with some sample data, using the script defined in `prisma/seed.ts`.

## Step 4. Deploy the application

You can deploy web applications directly from GitHub to Netlify. In this tutorial, we use the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) to deploy the app.

1. Install the `netlify` CLI:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ npm install netlify-cli -g
    ~~~

1. Sign into your Netlify account:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ netlify login
    ~~~

1. Run the app server locally to preview your site:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ netlify dev
    ~~~

    If the local deployment succeeds, you should see the following message in your terminal:

    ~~~
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                 │
    │   ◈ Server now ready on http://localhost:8888   │
    │                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ~~~

    For a preview of the site, visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

    Interacting with the site triggers the Netlify functions defined in the `netlify/functions` directory. These functions use Prisma Client to run [`SELECT`](selection-queries.html) and [`INSERT`](insert.html) queries against the database:
    - [`getScores.ts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-typescript/master/netlify/functions/getScores.ts) reads all rows from the `player_scores` table and returns values in the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns.
    - [`getPlayers.ts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-typescript/master/netlify/functions/getPlayers.ts) reads and returns all rows from the `players` table.
    - [`addScore.ts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-typescript/master/netlify/functions/addScore.ts) writes new scores to the `player_scores` table.

1. Deploy your app with the Netlify CLI:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ netlify deploy
    ~~~

    Choose to create a new site, and then select the default options for each of the subsequent prompts. You will be required to authorize Netlify with GitHub.

    After the app is deployed, you should see the following message:

    ~~~
    ✔ Deploy is live!
    ~~~

1. Navigate to the admin URL for your site:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ netlify open
    ~~~

    From the **Site overview** page, you can manage your site. The **Site overview** page also provides you with a public URL for your site.
