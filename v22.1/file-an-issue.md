If you've tried to [troubleshoot](troubleshooting-overview.html) an issue yourself, have [reached out for help](support-resources.html), and are still stumped, you can file an issue in GitHub.

To file an issue in GitHub, we need the following information:

1. A summary of the issue.

2. The steps to reproduce the issue.

3. The result you expected.

4. The result that actually occurred.

5. The first few lines of the log file from each node in the cluster in a timeframe as close as possible to reproducing the issue. On most Unix-based systems running with defaults, you can get this information using the following command:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ grep -F '[config]' cockroach-data/logs/cockroach.log
    ~~~
    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}You might need to replace <code>cockroach-data/logs</code> with the location of your <a href="logging-overview.html">logs</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}
    If the logs are not available, please include the output of `cockroach version` for each node in the cluster.
