title: BACKUP
summary: Back up your CockroachDB cluster to a cloud storage services such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or other NFS.
toc: true
docs_area: reference.sql
---

CockroachDB's `BACKUP` [statement](sql-statements.html) allows you to create [full or incremental backups](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) of your cluster's schema and data that are consistent as of a given timestamp.

You can [backup a full cluster](#backup-a-cluster), which includes:

- Relevant system tables
- All [databases](create-database.html)
- All [tables](create-table.html) (which automatically includes their [indexes](indexes.html))
- All [views](views.html)
- All [scheduled jobs](manage-a-backup-schedule.html#view-and-control-a-backup-initiated-by-a-schedule)

You can also backup:

- [An individual database](#backup-a-database), which includes all of its tables and views.
- [An individual table](#backup-a-table-or-view), which includes its indexes and views.

    `BACKUP` only backs up entire tables; it **does not** support backing up subsets of a table.

Because CockroachDB is designed with high fault tolerance, these backups are designed primarily for disaster recovery (i.e., if your cluster loses a majority of its nodes) through [`RESTORE`](restore.html). Isolated issues (such as small-scale node outages) do not require any intervention.

To view the contents of an backup created with the `BACKUP` statement, use [`SHOW BACKUP`](show-backup.html).

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/backups/backup-to-deprec.md %}

## Considerations

- Core users can only take [full backups](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups). To use the other backup features, you need an [Enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html). You can also use [{{ site.data.products.dedicated }}](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup?referralId=docs-crdb-backup), which runs [full backups daily and incremental backups hourly](../cockroachcloud/use-managed-service-backups.html).
- Backups will export [Enterprise license keys](enterprise-licensing.html) during a [full cluster backup](#backup-a-cluster). When you [restore](restore.html) a full cluster with an Enterprise license, it will restore the Enterprise license of the cluster you are restoring from.
- [Zone configurations](configure-zone.html) present on the destination cluster prior to a restore will be **overwritten** during a [cluster restore](restore.html#full-cluster) with the zone configurations from the [backed up cluster](#backup-a-cluster). If there were no customized zone configurations on the cluster when the backup was taken, then after the restore the destination cluster will use the zone configuration from the [`RANGE DEFAULT` configuration](configure-replication-zones.html#view-the-default-replication-zone).
- You cannot restore a backup of a multi-region database into a single-region database.
- Exclude a table's row data from a backup using the [`exclude_data_from_backup`](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#exclude-a-tables-data-from-backups) parameter.
- `BACKUP` is a blocking statement. To run a backup job asynchronously, use the `DETACHED` option. See the [options](#options) below.

### Storage considerations

- [HTTP storage](use-a-local-file-server-for-bulk-operations.html) is not supported for `BACKUP` and `RESTORE`.
- Modifying backup files in the storage location could invalidate a backup, and therefore, prevent a restore. In v22.1 and later, **we recommend enabling [object locking](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#object-locking) in your cloud storage bucket.**
- While Cockroach Labs actively tests Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Storage, we **do not** test [S3-compatible services](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html) (e.g., [MinIO](https://min.io/), [Red Hat Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/pacific/radosgw/s3/)).

## Required privileges

- [Full cluster backups](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) can only be run by members of the [`admin` role](security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). By default, the `root` user belongs to the `admin` role.
- For all other backups, the user must have [read access](security-reference/authorization.html#managing-privileges) on all objects being backed up. Database backups require `CONNECT` privileges, and table backups require `SELECT` privileges. Backups of user-defined schemas, or backups containing user-defined types, require `USAGE` privileges.
- `BACKUP` requires full read and write permissions to its target destination.
- {% include_cached new-in.html version="v22.1" %}`BACKUP` does **not** require delete or overwrite permissions to its target destination. This allows `BACKUP` to write to cloud storage buckets that have [object locking](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#object-locking) configured. We recommend enabling object locking in cloud storage buckets to protect the validity of a backup.

</div>

## Parameters

CockroachDB stores full backups in a backup collection. Each full backup in a collection may also have incremental backups. For more detail on this, see [Backup collections](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#backup-collections).

 Parameter | Description
-----------+-------------
`targets` | Back up the listed [targets](#targets).
`subdirectory` | The name of the specific backup (e.g., `2021/03/23-213101.37`) in the collection to which you want to add an [incremental backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups). To view available backup subdirectories, use [`SHOW BACKUPS IN collectionURI`](show-backup.html). If the backup `subdirectory` is not provided, incremental backups will be stored in the default `/incrementals` directory at the root of the collection URI. See the [Create incremental backups](#create-incremental-backups) example.<br><br>**Warning:** If you use an arbitrary `STRING` as the subdirectory, a new full backup will be created, but it will never be shown in `SHOW BACKUPS IN`. We do not recommend using arbitrary strings as subdirectory names.
`LATEST` | Append an incremental backup to the latest completed full backup's subdirectory.
<a name="collectionURI-param"></a> `collectionURI` | The URI where you want to store the backup. (Or, the default locality for a locality-aware backup.)<br/><br/>For information about this URL structure, see [Backup File URLs](#backup-file-urls).
`localityURI`   | The URI containing the `COCKROACH_LOCALITY` parameter for a non-default locality that is part of a single locality-aware backup.
`timestamp` | Back up data as it existed as of [`timestamp`](as-of-system-time.html). The `timestamp` must be more recent than your cluster's last garbage collection (which defaults to occur every 25 hours, but is [configurable per table](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-zone-variables)).
`backup_options` | Control the backup behavior with a comma-separated list of [these options](#options).

### Targets

Target                             | Description
-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
N/A                                | Backup the cluster. For an example of a full cluster backup, [see Backup a cluster](#backup-a-cluster).
`DATABASE {database_name} [, ...]` | The name of the database(s) you want to backup (i.e., create backups of all tables and views in the database). For an example of backing up a database, see [Backup a database](#backup-a-database).
`TABLE {table_name} [, ...]`       | The name of the table(s) or [view(s)](views.html) you want to backup. For an example of backing up a table or view, see [Backup a table or view](#backup-a-table-or-view).

### Options

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/backups/backup-options.md %}

### Backup file URLs

CockroachDB uses the URL provided to construct a secure API call to the service you specify. The URL structure depends on the type of file storage you are using. For more information, see the following:

- [URL format](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#url-format)
- [Example file URLs](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#example-file-urls)
- [Authentication parameters](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#authentication)

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Backups support cloud object locking and [Amazon S3 storage classes](#back-up-with-an-s3-storage-class). For more detail, see [Additional cloud storage feature support](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#additional-cloud-storage-feature-support).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Functional details

### Object dependencies

Dependent objects must be backed up at the same time as the objects they depend on.

Object | Depends On
-------|-----------
Table with [foreign key](foreign-key.html) constraints | The table it `REFERENCES`; however, this dependency can be [removed during the restore](restore.html#skip_missing_foreign_keys).
Table with a [sequence](create-sequence.html) | The sequence it uses; however, this dependency can be [removed during the restore](restore.html#skip_missing_sequences).
[Views](views.html) | The tables used in the view's `SELECT` statement.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
To exclude a table's row data from a backup, use the `exclude_data_from_backup` parameter with [`CREATE TABLE`](create-table.html#create-a-table-with-data-excluded-from-backup) or [`ALTER TABLE`](set-storage-parameter.html#exclude-a-tables-data-from-backups).

For more detail, see the [Exclude a table's data from backups](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#exclude-a-tables-data-from-backups) example.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Users and privileges

The `system.users` table stores your users and their passwords. To restore your users and privilege [grants](grant.html), do a cluster backup and restore the cluster to a fresh cluster with no user data. You can also backup the `system.users` table, and then use [this procedure](restore.html#restoring-users-from-system-users-backup).

## Performance

The `BACKUP` process minimizes its impact to the cluster's performance by distributing work to all nodes. Each node backs up only a specific subset of the data it stores (those for which it serves writes), with no two nodes backing up the same data.

`BACKUP`, like any read, cannot export a range if the range contains an [unresolved intent](architecture/transaction-layer.html#resolving-write-intents). While you typically will want bulk, background jobs like `BACKUP` to have as little impact on your foreground traffic as possible, it's more important for backups to actually complete (which maintains your [recovery point objective (RPO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective)). Unlike a normal read transaction that will block until any uncommitted writes it encounters are resolved, `BACKUP` will block only for a configurable duration before invoking priority to ensure it can complete on-time.

We recommend always starting backups with a specific [timestamp](timestamp.html) at least 10 seconds in the past. For example:

~~~ sql
> BACKUP...AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

This improves performance by decreasing the likelihood that the `BACKUP` will be [retried because it contends with other statements/transactions](transactions.html#transaction-retries). However, because `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` returns historical data, your reads might be stale. Taking backups with `AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s'` is a good best practice to reduce the number of still-running transactions you may encounter, since the backup will take priority and will force still-running transactions to restart after the backup is finished.

`BACKUP` will initially ask individual ranges to backup but to skip if they encounter an intent. Any range that is skipped is placed at the end of the queue. When `BACKUP` has completed its initial pass and is revisiting ranges, it will ask any range that did not resolve within the given time limit (default 1 minute) to attempt to resolve any intents that it encounters and to **not** skip. Additionally, the backup's transaction priority is then set to `high`, which causes other transactions to abort until the intents are resolved and the backup is finished.

{% include_cached new-in.html version="v22.1" %} A backup job will [pause](pause-job.html) instead of entering a `failed` state if it continues to encounter transient errors once it has retried a maximum number of times. Once the backup has paused, you can either [resume](resume-job.html) or [cancel](cancel-job.html) it.

### Backup performance configuration

Cluster settings provide a means to tune a CockroachDB cluster. The following cluster settings are helpful for configuring backup files and performance:

#### `bulkio.backup.file_size` 

Set a target for the amount of backup data written to each backup file. This is the maximum target size the backup will reach, but it is possible files of a smaller size are created during the backup job.

Note that if you lower `bulkio.backup.file_size` below the default, it will cause the backup job to create many small SST files, which could impact a restore job’s performance because it will need to keep track of so many small files.

**Default:** `128 MiB`

#### `cloudstorage.azure.concurrent_upload_buffers` 

Improve the speed of backups to Azure Storage by increasing `cloudstorage.azure.concurrent_upload_buffers` to `3`. This setting configures the number of concurrent buffers that are used during file uploads to Azure Storage. Note that the higher this setting the more data that is held in memory, which can increase the risk of OOMs if there is not sufficient memory on each node.

**Default:** `1`

For a complete list, including all cluster settings related to backups, see the [Cluster Settings](cluster-settings.html) page.

## Viewing and controlling backups jobs

After CockroachDB successfully initiates a backup, it registers the backup as a job, and you can do the following:

 Action                | SQL Statement
-----------------------+-----------------
View the backup status | [`SHOW JOBS`](show-jobs.html)
Pause the backup       | [`PAUSE JOB`](pause-job.html)
Resume the backup      | [`RESUME JOB`](resume-job.html)
Cancel the backup      | [`CANCEL JOB`](cancel-job.html)

You can also visit the [**Jobs** page](ui-jobs-page.html) of the DB Console to view job details. The `BACKUP` statement will return when the backup is finished or if it encounters an error.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The presence of the `BACKUP MANIFEST` file in the backup subdirectory is an indicator that the backup job completed successfully.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Examples

Per our guidance in the [Performance](#performance) section, we recommend starting backups from a time at least 10 seconds in the past using [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](as-of-system-time.html).

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/backups/bulk-auth-options.md %}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The `BACKUP ... TO` syntax is **deprecated** as of v22.1 and will be removed in a future release.

We recommend using the `BACKUP ... INTO {collectionURI}` syntax as per the following examples.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Backup a cluster

To take a [full backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) of a cluster:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP INTO \
's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

### Backup a database

To take a [full backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) of a single database:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP DATABASE bank \
INTO 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

To take a [full backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) of multiple databases:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP DATABASE bank, employees \
INTO 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

### Backup a table or view

To take a [full backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) of a single table or view:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP bank.customers \
INTO 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

To take a [full backup](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) of multiple tables:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP bank.customers, bank.accounts \
INTO 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

### Backup all tables in a schema

 To back up all tables in a [specified schema](create-schema.html), use a wildcard with the schema name:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP test_schema.*
INTO 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

Alternatively, use a [fully qualified name](sql-name-resolution.html#lookup-with-fully-qualified-names): `database.schema.*`.

With this syntax, schemas will be resolved before databases. `test_object.*` will resolve to a _schema_ of `test_object` within the set current database before matching to a database of `test_object`.

If a database and schema have the same name, such as `bank.bank`, running `BACKUP bank.*` will result in the schema resolving first. All the tables within that schema will be backed up. However, if this were to be run from a different database that does not have a `bank` schema, all tables in the `bank` database will be backed up.

See [Name Resolution](sql-name-resolution.html) for more details on how naming hierarchy and name resolution work in CockroachDB.

### Create incremental backups

When a `BACKUP` statement specifies an existing subdirectory in the collection, explicitly or via the `LATEST` keyword, an incremental backup will be added to the default `/incrementals` directory at the root of the [collection](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#backup-collections) storage location.

To take an incremental backup using the `LATEST` keyword:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP INTO LATEST IN \
    's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
    AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

To store the backup in an existing subdirectory in the collection:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
BACKUP INTO {'subdirectory'} IN 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If you intend to take a **full** backup, we recommend running `BACKUP INTO {collectionURI}` without specifying a subdirectory.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

To explicitly control where you store your incremental backups, use the [`incremental_location`](backup.html#options) option. For more detail, see [this example](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups-with-explicitly-specified-destinations) demonstrating the `incremental_location` option.

### Run a backup asynchronously

Use the `DETACHED` [option](#options) to execute the backup [job](show-jobs.html) asynchronously:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> BACKUP INTO \
's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}' \
AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s'
WITH DETACHED;
~~~

The job ID is returned after the backup [job creation](backup-architecture.html#job-creation-phase) completes:

~~~
        job_id
----------------------
  592786066399264769
(1 row)
~~~

**Without** the `DETACHED` option, `BACKUP` will block the SQL connection until the job completes. Once finished, the job status and more detailed job data is returned:

~~~
job_id             |  status   | fraction_completed | rows | index_entries | bytes
---------------------+-----------+--------------------+------+---------------+--------
652471804772712449 | succeeded |                  1 |   50 |             0 |  4911
(1 row)
~~~

### Back up with an S3 storage class

{% include_cached new-in.html version="v22.1" %} To associate your backup objects with a [specific storage class](use-cloud-storage-for-bulk-operations.html#amazon-s3-storage-classes) in your Amazon S3 bucket, use the `S3_STORAGE_CLASS` parameter with the class. For example, the following S3 connection URI specifies the `INTELLIGENT_TIERING` storage class:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
BACKUP DATABASE movr INTO 's3://{BUCKET NAME}?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={KEY ID}&AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={SECRET ACCESS KEY}&S3_STORAGE_CLASS=INTELLIGENT_TIERING' AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-10s';
~~~

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/misc/storage-classes.md %}
