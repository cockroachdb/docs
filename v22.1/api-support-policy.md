summary: Learn about Cockroach Labs' policy for supporting CockroachDB APIs.

Cockroach Labs exposes various application programming interfaces (APIs).

The vast majority of changes to these interfaces are seamless additions of new functionality. However, some changes are backward-incompatible and may require you to adjust your integration. Changes to an API are introduced according to its *stability guarantees*, which depend on its *support policy*.

This page includes the following information:

- Our [support policies](#support-policies) for each type of API.
- Our [stability guarantees](#stability-guarantees) for supported APIs.
- A summary of [APIs](#apis) that CockroachDB makes available.

## Support policies

| Type             | Description                                                               | Stability guarantees |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Programmable     | Supported for interfacing with third-party automated tools.               | âœ“                    |
| Non-programmable | Supported for consumption by humans. Not supported for automation.        |                      |
| Reserved         | Intended for use by CockroachDB developers. Not supported for public use. |                      |

### Stability guarantees

An API is *stable* if it does not receive backward-incompatible changes. API stability implies programmability.

The following stability guarantees apply to **programmable** APIs. These APIs remain stable within major versions:

- Backward-incompatible changes may be introduced in new major versions.
- Backward-compatible changes may be introduced in new minor versions.

Stability guarantees do **not** apply to non-programmable and reserved APIs:

- Backward-incompatible changes may be introduced in new minor and major versions.

#### API changes

The following types of API changes qualify as *backward-incompatible* (or "breaking changes"):

- Removal of an endpoint, SQL statement, [built-in function](functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions), [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html), or session variable.
- Addition or removal of a mandatory command-line flag.
- Change in SQL statement syntax, HTTP request format, HTTP response format, or structured log format.
- Change in data type, default value, or behavior of a [built-in function](functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions), [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html), or session variable.
- Change to [authorization](security-reference/authorization.html) requirements.

The following types of API changes qualify as *backward-compatible*. This list is not exhaustive.

- Removal or change of any functionality documented or named as "experimental", "beta", or otherwise not fully supported.
- Deprecation of any functionality without removal.
- Addition or removal of an optional command-line flag.
- Addition or removal of a metric.
- Change in SQL response format or unstructured log format.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Backward-incompatible changes to CockroachDB, including those affecting programmable APIs, are identified in the [release notes](releases/index.html#production-releases) for major CockroachDB versions. Users are asked to [consider backward-incompatible changes before upgrading](upgrade-cockroach-version.html#review-breaking-changes) to a new CockroachDB version.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Versioning

A programmable API may be assigned a new version number in two situations:

- When changes are introduced to the API.
- When a new CockroachDB version is released.

The assignment of a **major** version number to a [programmable API](#support-policies) indicates that the API is stable within that major version.

## APIs

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
A *mixed* API includes both programmable and non-programmable features. [Stability guarantees](#stability-guarantees) apply to the programmable features.
