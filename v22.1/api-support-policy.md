Cockroach Labs exposes various application programming interfaces (APIs).

The vast majority of changes to these interfaces are seamless additions of new functionality. However, some changes are backward-incompatible and may require you to adjust your integration. Changes to an API are introduced according to its support policy.

This page includes the following information:

- Our API [support policies](#support-policies).
- Our definitions of [backward-incompatible](#backward-incompatible-changes) and [backward-compatible](#backward-compatible-changes) changes.
- A summary of [APIs](#apis) that CockroachDB makes available.

## Support policies

| Unstable | Supported for consumption by humans.

Backward-incompatible changes to **stable APIs** are highlighted in the [release notes](../releases/index.html#production-releases) for major CockroachDB versions. Users are asked to [consider backward-incompatible changes before upgrading](upgrade-cockroach-version.html#review-breaking-changes) to a new CockroachDB version.

### Backward-incompatible changes

A change is *backward-incompatible* when existing automation requires an update in order to continue working. These changes are also known as "breaking changes":

- Removal or renaming of an endpoint, [built-in function](functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions), [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html), or session variable.
- Removal or renaming of a SQL statement or syntax.
- Addition, removal, or renaming of a mandatory command-line flag or HTTP field.
- Removal or renaming of an optional command-line flag or HTTP field.
- Change in behavior of a [built-in function](functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) without fixing a bug or PostgreSQL incompatibility.
- Removal or renaming of possible values in an `ENUM` session variable or [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html).
- Change in non-interactive [`cockroach sql`](cockroach-sql.html) shell input or output.
- Change in behavior of a [structured log event](eventlog.html) type, including the [logging channel](logging-overview.html#logging-channels) it is emitted on.
- Renaming of a [structured log event](eventlog.html) type or payload field.

### Backward-compatible changes

A change is *backward-compatible* when existing automation continues to work without updates.

The following list is not exhaustive:

- Addition of an optional command-line flag or HTTP field.
- Removal or change of any functionality documented as Preview or otherwise not fully supported.
- Marking functionality as deprecated via in-line documentation, hints, or warnings without removing it altogether.
- Addition or removal of a metric.
- Addition of a structured log event type or payload field.
- Addition of a new [logging channel](logging-overview.html#logging-channels).

### Versioning

A stable API may be assigned a new version number in two situations:

- When changes are introduced to the API.
- When a new CockroachDB version is released.
