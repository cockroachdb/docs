summary: How to configure CockroachDB logs with the --log or --log-config-file flag and YAML payload.
toc: true

---

This page describes how to configure CockroachDB logs with the [`--log` or `log-config-file` flag](cockroach-start.html#logging) and a [YAML payload](#yaml-payload). Most logging behaviors are configurable, including:

- The [log sinks](#configure-log-sinks) that output logs to different locations, including over the network.
- The [logging channels](logging-overview.html#logging-channels) that are mapped to each sink.
- The [format](log-formats.html) used by the log messages.
- The [redaction](#redact-logs) of log messages.

For examples of how these settings can be used in practice, see [Logging Use Cases](logging-use-cases.html).

## Flag

To configure the logging behavior of a `cockroach` command, include one of these flags with the command:

- `--log={yaml}`, where `{yaml}` is the [YAML payload](#yaml-payload)
- `--log-config-file={yaml-file}`, where `{yaml-file}` is the path to a YAML file

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
All [`cockroach` commands](cockroach-commands.html) support logging and can be configured with `--log` or `--log-config-file`. However, note that most messages related to cluster operation are generated by [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) or [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html). Other commands generate messages related to their own execution, which are mainly useful when troubleshooting the behaviors of those commands.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## YAML payload

All log settings for a `cockroach` command are specified with a YAML payload in one of the following formats:

- Block format, where each parameter is written on a separate line. For example, after creating a file `logs.yaml`, pass the YAML values with either `--log-config-file` or `--log`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start-single-node --certs-dir=certs --log-config-file=logs.yaml
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ shell
  	$ cockroach start-single-node --certs-dir=certs --log="$(cat logs.yaml)"
  	~~~

- Inline format, where all parameters are specified on one line. For example, to generate an `ops` log file that collects the `OPS` and `HEALTH` channels (overriding the file groups defined for those channels in the [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration)):

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
  	~~~ shell
  	$ cockroach start-single-node --certs-dir=certs --log="sinks: {file-groups: {ops: {channels: [OPS, HEALTH]}}}"
  	~~~

  	Note that the inline spaces must be preserved.

For clarity, this article uses the block format to describe the YAML payload, which has the overall structure:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...       # defaults inherited by file sinks
fluent-defaults: ...     # defaults inherited by Fluentd sinks
http-defaults: ...       # defaults inherited by HTTP sinks
sinks:
   file-groups: ...      # file sink definitions
   fluent-servers: ...   # Fluentd sink definitions
   http-servers: ...     # HTTP sink definitions
   stderr: ...           # stderr sink definitions
capture-stray-errors: ... # parameters for the stray error capture system
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Providing a logging configuration is optional. Any fields included in the YAML payload will override the same fields in the [default logging configuration](#default-logging-configuration).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
You can view your current settings by running `cockroach debug check-log-config`, which returns the YAML definitions and a URL to a visualization of the current logging configuration.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Configure log sinks

Log *sinks* route events from specified [logging channels](logging-overview.html#logging-channels) to destinations outside CockroachDB. These destinations currently include [log files](#output-to-files), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)-compatible [servers](#output-to-fluentd-compatible-network-collectors), [HTTP servers](#output-to-http-network-collectors), and the [standard error stream (`stderr`)](#output-to-stderr).

All supported output destinations are configured under `sinks`:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
http-defaults: ...
sinks:
  file-groups:
    {file group name}:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
  fluent-servers:
    {server name}:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
  http-servers:
    {server name}:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
  stderr:
      channels: {channels}
      ...
~~~

<a name="common-sink-parameters"></a>

All supported sink types use the following common sink parameters:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filter`        | Minimum severity level at which logs enter the channels selected for the sink. Accepts one of the valid [severity levels](logging.html#logging-levels-severities) or `NONE`, which excludes all messages from the sink output. For details, see [Set logging levels](#set-logging-levels).                                                                                                                                   |
| `format`        | Log message format to use for file or network sinks. Accepts one of the valid [log formats](log-formats.html). For details, see [file logging format](#file-logging-format), [Fluentd logging format](#fluentd-logging-format), and [HTTP logging format](#http-logging-format).                                                                                                                                             |
| `redact`        | When `true`, enables automatic redaction of personally identifiable information (PII) from log messages. This ensures that sensitive data is not transmitted when collecting logs centrally or over a network. For details, see [Redact logs](#redact-logs).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `redactable`    | When `true`, preserves redaction markers around fields that are considered sensitive in the log messages. The markers are recognized by [`cockroach debug zip`](cockroach-debug-zip.html) and [`cockroach debug merge-logs`](cockroach-debug-merge-logs.html) but may not be compatible with external log collectors. For details on how the markers appear in each format, see [Log formats](log-formats.html).             |
| `exit-on-error` | When `true`, stops the Cockroach node if an error is encountered while writing to the sink. We recommend enabling this option on file sinks in order to avoid losing any log entries. When set to `false`, this can be used to mark certain sinks (such as `stderr`) as non-critical.                                                                                                                                        |
| `auditable`     | If `true`, enables `exit-on-error` on the sink. Also disables `buffered-writes` if the sink is under `file-groups`. This guarantees [non-repudiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) for any logs in the sink, but can incur a performance overhead and higher disk IOPS consumption. This setting is typically enabled for [security-related logs](logging-use-cases.html#security-and-audit-monitoring). |

If not specified for a given sink, these parameter values are inherited from [`file-defaults`](#set-file-defaults) (for file sinks), [`fluent-defaults`](#set-fluentd-defaults) (for Fluentd sinks), and [`http-defaults`](#set-http-defaults) (for HTTP sinks).

### Output to files

CockroachDB can write messages to one or more log files.

`file-groups` specifies the channels that output to each log file, along with its output directory and other configuration details. For example:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
http-defaults: ...
sinks:
  file-groups:
    default:
      channels: [DEV]
    health:
      channels: [HEALTH]
      dir: health-logs
    ...
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
A file group name is arbitrary and is used to name the log files. The `default` file group is an exception. For details, see [Log file naming](#log-file-naming).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters), each file group accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`         | List of channels that output to this sink. Use a YAML array or string of [channel names](logging-overview.html#logging-channels), `ALL` to include all channels, or `ALL EXCEPT {channels}` to include all channels except the specified channel names.<br><br>For more details on acceptable syntax, see [Logging channel selection](#logging-channel-selection).                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `dir`              | Output directory for log files generated by this sink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `max-file-size`    | Approximate maximum size of individual files generated by this sink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `max-group-size`   | Approximate maximum combined size of all files to be preserved for this sink. An asynchronous garbage collection removes files that cause the file set to grow beyond this specified size. For high-traffic deployments, or to ensure log retention over longer periods of time, consider raising this value to `500MiB` or `1GiB`.<br><br>**Default:** `100MiB`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `file-permissions` |  The `chmod`-style permissions on generated log files, formatted as a 3-digit octal number. The executable bit must not be set. <br><br>**Default:** `644` (readable by all, writable by owner)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `buffered-writes`  | When `true`, enables buffering of writes. Set to `false` to flush every log entry (i.e., propagate data from the `cockroach` process to the OS) and synchronize writes (i.e., ask the OS to confirm the log data was written to disk). Disabling this setting provides [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation) guarantees, but can incur a performance overhead and higher disk IOPS consumption. This setting is typically disabled for [security-related logs](logging-use-cases.html#security-and-audit-monitoring). |

If not specified for a given file group, the parameter values are inherited from [`file-defaults`](#configure-logging-defaults) (except `channels`, which uses the [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration)).

#### Log file naming

Log files are named in the following format:

~~~
{process}-{file group}.{host}.{user}.{start timestamp in UTC}.{process ID}.log
~~~

For example, a file group `health` will generate a log file that looks like this:

~~~
cockroach-health.work-laptop.worker.2021-03-15T15_24_10Z.024338.log
~~~

For each file group, a symlink points to the latest generated log file. It's easiest to refer to the symlink. For example:

~~~
cockroach-health.log
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The files generated for a group named `default` are named after the pattern `cockroach.{metadata}.log`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Access in DB Console

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
{% include {{ page.version.version }}/ui/ui-log-files.md %}
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

#### Known limitations

Log files can only be accessed in the DB Console if they are stored in the same directory as the file sink for the `DEV` channel.

### Output to Fluentd-compatible network collectors

CockroachDB can send logs over the network to a [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)-compatible log collector (e.g., [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)). `fluent-servers` specifies the channels that output to a server, along with the server configuration details. For example:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
http-defaults: ...
sinks:
  fluent-servers:
    health:
      channels: [HEALTH]
      address: 127.0.0.1:5170
    ...
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
A Fluentd sink can be listed more than once with different `address` values. This routes the same logs to different Fluentd servers.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters), each Fluentd server accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`      | List of channels that output to this sink. Use a YAML array or string of [channel names](logging-overview.html#logging-channels), `ALL` to include all channels, or `ALL EXCEPT {channels}` to include all channels except the specified channel names.<br><br>For more details on acceptable syntax, see [Logging channel selection](#logging-channel-selection). |
| `address` | Network address and port of the log collector.                                                                     |
| `net`     | Network protocol to use. Can be `tcp`, `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp`, `udp4`, `udp6`, or `unix`.<br><br>**Default:** `tcp` |

A Fluentd sink buffers at most one log entry and retries sending the event at most one time if a network error is encountered. This is just sufficient to tolerate a restart of the Fluentd collector after a configuration change under light logging activity. If the server is unavailable for too long, or if more than one error is encountered, an error is reported to the process's standard error output with a copy of the logging event, and the logging event is dropped.

For an example network logging configuration, see [Logging use cases](logging-use-cases.html#network-logging).

### Output to HTTP network collectors

 CockroachDB can send logs over the network to an HTTP server. `http-servers` specifies the channels that output to a server, along with the server configuration details. For example:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
http-defaults: ...
sinks:
  http-servers:
    health:
      channels: [HEALTH]
      address: 127.0.0.1:5170
  	  method: POST
  	  unsafe-tls: false
  	  timeout: 2s
  	  disable-keep-alives: false
      ...
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
An HTTP sink can be listed more than once with different `address` values. This routes the same logs to different HTTP servers.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters), each HTTP server accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`            | List of channels that output to this sink.

An HTTP sink buffers at most one log entry and retries sending the event at most one time if a network error is encountered. This is just sufficient to tolerate a restart of the HTTP collector after a configuration change under light logging activity. If the server is unavailable for too long, or if more than one error is encountered, an error is reported to the process's standard error output with a copy of the logging event, and the logging event is dropped.

For an example network logging configuration, see [Logging use cases](logging-use-cases.html#network-logging).

### Output to `stderr`

CockroachDB can output messages to the [standard error stream (`stderr`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)), which prints them to the machine's terminal but does not store them. `stderr` specifies the channels that output to the stream. For example:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
http-defaults: ...
sinks:
  stderr:
    channels: [DEV]
~~~

Along with the [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters), `stderr` accepts the following parameters:

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The `format` parameter for `stderr` is set to [`crdb-v2-tty`](log-formats.html#format-crdb-v2-tty) and cannot be changed.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

| Parameter  | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `channels`      | List of channels that output to this sink. Use a YAML array or string of [channel names](logging-overview.html#logging-channels), `ALL` to include all channels, or `ALL EXCEPT {channels}` to include all channels except the specified channel names.<br><br>For more details on acceptable syntax, see [Logging channel selection](#logging-channel-selection). |
| `no-color` | When `true`, removes terminal color [escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) from the output. |

Because server start-up messages are always emitted at the start of the standard error stream, it is generally difficult to automate integration of `stderr` with log analyzers. We recommend using [file logging](#output-to-files) or network logging via [Fluentd](#output-to-fluentd-compatible-network-collectors) or [HTTP](#output-to-http-network-collectors) instead of `stderr` when integrating with automated monitoring software.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
By default, `cockroach start` and `cockroach start-single-node` do not print any messages to `stderr`. However, if the `cockroach` process does not have access to on-disk storage, all messages are printed to `stderr`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Logging channel selection

For each sink, multiple channels can be selected. Note that:

- Spacing between items will vary according to the syntax used.
- Channel selection is case-insensitive.

These selections are equivalent:

~~~ yaml
# Select OPS and HEALTH.
channels: [OPS, HEALTH]
channels: 'OPS, HEALTH'
channels: OPS,HEALTH
channels:
- OPS
- HEALTH
~~~

By default, the severity level set by `filter` in the [sink configuration](#common-sink-parameters) is used. However, you can specify a different severity level for each channel. For more information on severity levels, see [Set logging levels](#set-logging-levels).

These selections are equivalent:

~~~ yaml
# Select PERF at severity INFO, and HEALTH and OPS at severity WARNING.
channels: {INFO: [PERF], WARNING: [HEALTH, OPS]}
channels:
  INFO:
  - PERF
  WARNING:
  - OPS
  - HEALTH
~~~

Brackets are optional when selecting a single channel:

~~~ yaml
channels: OPS
channels: {INFO: PERF}
~~~

To select all channels, using the `all` keyword:

~~~ yaml
channels: all
channels: 'all'
channels: [all]
channels: ['all']
~~~

To select all channels except for a subset, using the `all except` keyword prefix:

~~~ yaml
channels: all except ops,health
channels: all except [ops,health]
channels: 'all except ops, health'
channels: 'all except [ops, health]'
~~~

## Configure logging defaults

When setting up a logging configuration, it's simplest to define shared parameters in `file-defaults` and `fluent-defaults` and override specific values as needed in [`file-groups`](#output-to-files), [`fluent-servers`](#output-to-fluentd-compatible-network-collectors), [`http-servers`](#output-to-http-network-collectors), and [`stderr`](#output-to-stderr). For a complete example, see the [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
You can view your current settings by running `cockroach debug check-log-config`, which returns the YAML definitions and a URL to a visualization of the current logging configuration.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

This section describes some recommended defaults.

### Set file defaults

Defaults for log files are set in `file-defaults`, which accepts all [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters) and the [file group parameters](#output-to-files) `dir`, `max-file-size`, `max-group-size`, `file-permissions`, and `buffered-writes`.

#### Logging directory

By default, CockroachDB adds log files to a `logs` subdirectory in the first on-disk [`store` directory](cockroach-start.html#store) (default: `cockroach-data`):

~~~
cockroach-data/logs
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Each Cockroach node generates log files in the directory specified by its logging configuration. These logs detail the internal activity of that node without visibility into the behavior of other nodes. When troubleshooting, it's best to refer to the output directory for the cluster log files, which collect the messages from all active nodes.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

In cloud deployments, the [main data store](cockroach-start.html#store) will be subject to an IOPS budget. Adding logs to the store directory will excessively consume IOPS. For this reason, cloud deployments should output log files to a separate directory with fewer IOPS restrictions.

You can override the default logging directory like this:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  dir: /custom/dir/path/
~~~

#### File logging format

The default message format for log files is [`crdb-v2`](log-formats.html#format-crdb-v2). Each `crdb-v2` log message starts with a flat prefix that contains event metadata (e.g., severity, date, timestamp, channel), followed by the event payload. For details on the metadata, see [Log formats](log-formats.html#format-crdb-v2).

If you plan to read logs programmatically, you can switch to a [JSON](log-formats.html#format-json) or [compact JSON](log-formats.html#format-json-compact) format:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  format: json
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`format` refers to the envelope of the log message, which contains the event metadata. This is separate from the event payload, which corresponds to its [event type](eventlog.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Set Fluentd defaults

Defaults for Fluentd-compatible network sinks are set in `fluent-defaults`, which accepts all [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters).

Note that the [server parameters](#output-to-fluentd-compatible-network-collectors) `address` and `net` are *not* specified in `fluent-defaults`:

- `address` must be specified for each sink under `fluent-servers`.
- `net` is not required and defaults to `tcp`.

#### Fluentd logging format

The default message format for network output is [`json-fluent-compact`](log-formats.html#format-json-fluent-compact). Each log message is structured as a JSON payload that can be read programmatically. The `json-fluent-compact` and [`json-fluent`](log-formats.html#format-json-fluent) formats include a `tag` field that is required by the [Fluentd protocol](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file). For details, see [Log formats](log-formats.html#format-json-fluent-compact).

~~~ yaml
fluent-defaults:
  format: json-fluent
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`format` refers to the envelope of the log message. This is separate from the event payload, which is structured according to [event type](eventlog.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Set HTTP defaults

Defaults for HTTP sinks are set in `http-defaults`, which accepts all [common sink parameters](#common-sink-parameters).

Note that the [server parameters](#output-to-http-network-collectors) `address` and `method` are *not* specified in `fluent-defaults`:

- `address` must be specified for each sink under `http-servers`.
- `method` is not required and defaults to `POST`.

#### HTTP logging format

The default message format for HTTP output is [`json-compact`](log-formats.html#format-json-compact). Each log message is structured as a JSON payload that can be read programmatically. For details, see [Log formats](log-formats.html#format-json-compact).

~~~ yaml
http-defaults:
  format: json
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
`format` refers to the envelope of the log message. This is separate from the event payload, which is structured according to [event type](eventlog.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Set logging levels

Log messages are associated with a [severity level](logging.html#logging-levels-severities) when they are generated.

Each logging sink accepts messages from each logging channel at a minimum severity level. This minimum severity level can be specified [per sink](#common-sink-parameters) or by default using the `filter` attribute.

Messages with severity levels below the configured threshold do not enter logging channels and are discarded.

The [default configuration](#default-logging-configuration) uses the following severity levels for [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html):

- `file-defaults`, `fluent-defaults`, and `http-defaults` each use `filter: INFO`. Since `INFO` is the lowest severity level, file and network sinks will emit all log messages.
- `stderr` uses `filter: NONE` and does not emit log messages.
- The `default` file group uses `filter: INFO` for events from the `DEV` and `OPS` channels, and `filter: WARNING` for all others.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
All other `cockroach` commands use `filter: WARNING` and log to `stderr` by default, with these exceptions:

- [`cockroach workload`](cockroach-sql.html#logging) uses `filter: INFO`.
- [`cockroach demo`](cockroach-demo.html#logging) uses `filter: NONE` (discards all log messages).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

You can override the `file-defaults`, `fluent-defaults`, and `http-defaults` severity levels on a per-sink basis.

For example, this will include `DEV` events at severity `WARNING`:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  file-groups:
    dev:
      channels: DEV
      filter: WARNING
~~~

You can also override the `filter` attribute and set severity levels on a [per-channel](#logging-channel-selection) basis.

For example, this will include `DEV` events at severity `INFO`, and `OPS` events at severity `ERROR`:

~~~ yaml
sinks:
  file-groups:
    dev:
      channels: {INFO: DEV, ERROR: OPS}
~~~

### Redact logs

CockroachDB can redact personally identifiable information (PII) from log messages. The logging system includes two parameters that handle this differently:

- `redact` is disabled by default. When enabled, `redact` automatically redacts sensitive data from logging output. We do *not* recommend enabling this on the `DEV` channel because it impairs our ability to troubleshoot problems.
- `redactable` is enabled by default. This places redaction markers around sensitive fields in log messages. These markers are recognized by [`cockroach debug zip`](cockroach-debug-zip.html) and [`cockroach debug merge-logs`](cockroach-debug-merge-logs.html), which aggregate CockroachDB log files and can be instructed to redact sensitive data from their output.

When collecting logs centrally (e.g., in data mining scenarios where non-privileged users have access to logs) or over a network (e.g., to an external log collector), it's safest to enable `redact`:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  redact: true
fluent-defaults:
  redact: true
http-defaults:
  redact: true
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
In addition, the `DEV` channel should be output to a separate logging directory, since it is likely to contain sensitive data. See [`DEV` channel](#dev-channel).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

External log collectors can misinterpret the `cockroach debug` redaction markers, since they are specific to CockroachDB. To prevent this issue when using network sinks, disable `redactable`:

~~~ yaml
fluent-defaults:
  redactable: false
~~~

### DEV channel

The `DEV` channel is used for debug and uncategorized messages. It can therefore be noisy and contain sensitive (PII) information.

We recommend configuring `DEV` separately from the other logging channels. When sending logs to a [Fluentd-compatible](#output-to-fluentd-compatible-network-collectors) or [HTTP](#output-to-http-network-collectors) network collector, `DEV` logs should also be excluded from network collection.

In this example, the `dev` file group is reserved for `DEV` logs. These are output to a `cockroach-dev.log` file in a custom disk `dir`:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
sinks:
  file-groups:
    dev:
      channels: [DEV]
      dir: /custom/dir/path/
    ...
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
To ensure that you are protecting sensitive information, also [redact your logs](#redact-logs).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Stray error capture

Certain events, such as uncaught software exceptions (panics), bypass the CockroachDB logging system. However, they can be useful in troubleshooting. For example, if CockroachDB crashes, it normally logs a stack trace to what caused the problem.

To ensure that these stray errors can be tracked, CockroachDB does not send them to `stderr` by default. Instead, stray errors are output to a `cockroach-stderr.log` file in the default [logging directory](#logging-directory).

You can change these settings in `capture-stray-errors`:

~~~ yaml
file-defaults: ...
fluent-defaults: ...
sinks: ...
capture-stray-errors:
  enable: true
  dir: /custom/dir/path/
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
When `capture-stray-errors` is disabled, [`redactable`](#redact-logs) cannot be enabled on the `stderr` sink. This is because `stderr` will contain both stray errors and logged events and cannot apply redaction markers in a reliable way. Note that [`redact`](#redact-logs) can still be enabled on `stderr` in this case.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Default logging configuration

The YAML payload below represents the default logging behavior of [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](cockroach-start-single-node.html).

~~~ yaml
file-defaults:
  max-file-size: 10MiB
  max-group-size: 100MiB

    filter: NONE
    redact: false
    redactable: true
    exit-on-error: true
capture-stray-errors:
  enable: true
  max-group-size: 100MiB
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
For high-traffic deployments that [output log messages to files](#output-to-files), consider raising `file-defaults: {max-group-size}` to `500MiB` or `1GiB` to extend log retention.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Note that a default `dir` is not specified for `file-defaults` and `capture-stray-errors`:

- The default `dir` for `file-defaults` is inferred from the first on-disk [`store` directory](cockroach-start.html#store). See [Logging directory](#logging-directory).
- The default `dir` for `capture-stray-errors` is inherited form `file-defaults`.
