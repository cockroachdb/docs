The **Queues** dashboard lets you monitor the health and performance of various queueing systems in CockroachDB.

To view this dashboard, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and click **Metrics** on the left-hand navigation, and then select **Dashboard** > **Queues**.

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/ui/ui-metrics-navigation.md %}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
All timestamps in the DB Console are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

The **Queues** dashboard displays the following time series graphs:
