## Create CockroachDB users

Use the [`CREATE USER`](create-user.html) and [`DROP USER`](drop-user.html) statements to create and remove users, the [`ALTER USER`](alter-user.html) statement to add or change a user's password and role options, the [`GRANT`](grant.html) and [`REVOKE`](revoke.html) statements to manage the userâ€™s privileges, and the [`SHOW USERS`](show-users.html) statement to list users.

A new user must be granted the required privileges for each database and table that the user needs to access.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
By default, a new user belongs to the `public` role and has no privileges other than those assigned to the `public` role.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}


## Create and manage roles

To create and manage your cluster's roles, use the following statements:

Statement | Description
----------|------------
[`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.html) | Create SQL roles.
[`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.html) | Remove one or more SQL roles.
[`GRANT`](grant.html) | Manage each role or user's SQL privileges for interacting with specific databases and tables, or add a role or user as a member to a role.
[`REVOKE`](revoke.html) | Revoke privileges from users and/or roles, or revoke a role or user's membership to a role.
[`SHOW ROLES`](show-roles.html) | List the roles for all databases.
[`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.html) | List the privileges granted to users.














For example, suppose a cluster contains a role named `cockroachlabs`, and a user named `max` is a member of the `cockroachlabs` role:

~~~
root@localhost:26257/defaultdb> show roles;
    username    | options |    member_of
----------------+---------+------------------
  admin         |         | {}
  cockroachlabs |         | {}
  max           |         | {cockroachlabs}
  root          |         | {admin}
(4 rows)
~~~

If a user connects to the cluster as `cockroachlabs` and creates a table named `albums`, then any user that is also a member of the `cockroachlabs` role will have `ALL` privileges on that table:

~~~
cockroachlabs@localhost:26257/db> CREATE TABLE albums (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        title STRING,
        length DECIMAL,
        tracklist JSONB
);
~~~

~~~
max@localhost:26257/db> ALTER TABLE albums ADD COLUMN year INT;
ALTER TABLE


Time: 1.137s total (execution 1.137s / network 0.000s)

max@localhost:26257/db> SHOW CREATE TABLE albums;
  table_name |                     create_statement
-------------+------------------------------------------------------------
  albums     | CREATE TABLE public.albums (
             |     id UUID NOT NULL,
             |     title STRING NULL,
             |     length DECIMAL NULL,
             |     tracklist JSONB NULL,
             |     year INT8 NULL,
             |     CONSTRAINT "primary" PRIMARY KEY (id ASC),
             |     FAMILY "primary" (id, title, length, tracklist, year)
             | )
(1 row)
~~~

The following example uses MovR, a fictional vehicle-sharing application, to demonstrate CockroachDB [SQL statements](sql-statements.html). For more information about the MovR example application and dataset, see [MovR: A Global Vehicle-sharing App](movr.html).

Let's say we want to create the following access control setup for the `movr` database:

- One database admin (named `db_admin`) who can perform all database operations for existing tables as well as for tables added in the future.
- One app user (named `app_user`) who can add, read update, and delete vehicles from the `vehicles` table.
- One user (named `report_user`) who can only read the `vehicles` table.

1. Use the [`cockroach demo`](cockroach-demo.html) command to load the `movr` database and dataset into a CockroachDB cluster:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach demo
    ~~~

2. Create the database admin (named `db_admin`) who can perform all database operations for existing tables as well as for  tables added in the future:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER db_admin;
    ~~~

3. Grant all privileges on database `movr` to user `db_admin`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT ALL ON DATABASE movr TO db_admin;
    ~~~

4. Grant all privileges on all tables in database `movr` to user `db_admin`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT ALL ON TABLE * TO db_admin;
    ~~~

5. Verify that `db_admin` has all privileges:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR db_admin;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      database_name |    schema_name     |         table_name         | grantee  | privilege_type  
    +---------------+--------------------+----------------------------+----------+----------------+
      movr          | crdb_internal      | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | information_schema | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | pg_catalog         | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | NULL                       | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | promo_codes                | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | rides                      | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | user_promo_codes           | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | users                      | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | vehicle_location_histories | db_admin | ALL             
      movr          | public             | vehicles                   | db_admin | ALL             
    (10 rows)
    ~~~

6. As the `root` user, create a SQL user named `app_user` with permissions to add, read, update, and delete vehicles in the `vehicles` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER app_user;
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT ON vehicles TO app_user;
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR app_user;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      database_name | schema_name | table_name | grantee  | privilege_type  
    +---------------+-------------+------------+----------+----------------+
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | DELETE          
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | INSERT          
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | SELECT          
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | app_user | UPDATE          
    (4 rows)
    ~~~

7. As the `root` user, create a SQL user named `report_user` with permissions to only read from the `vehicles` table:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER report_user;
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT SELECT ON vehicles TO report_user;
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR report_user;
    ~~~

    ~~~
      database_name | schema_name | table_name |   grantee   | privilege_type  
    +---------------+-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
      movr          | public      | vehicles   | report_user | SELECT          
    (1 row)
    ~~~
