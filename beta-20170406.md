### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- The implementation of indexing for [collated string columns](collate.html) has changed. Any secondary indexes containing collated strings must be [dropped](drop-index.html) before upgrading to this version and then [re-created](create-index.html) after upgrading. Note that this applies only to secondary indexes, not to primary indexes. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

- Any row with a `-0` [`FLOAT`](float.html) or [`DECIMAL`](decimal.html) value in a primary key or index must be [deleted](delete.html) before upgrading to this version and then [re-inserted](insert.html) after upgrading. Otherwise, the row containing `-0` will show up during table scans, but it will not be possible to delete it or select it as part of an index scan.

  If you suspect `-0` values are present but don't know where, an alternative approach is to use [`cockroach dump`](back-up-and-restore-data.html) to back up tables with `FLOAT` or `DECIMAL` columns, drop the tables before upgrading, and then use the backup files to recreate the tables and indexes after upgrading. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

- The `experimental_strptime` and `experimental_strftime` [functions](functions-and-operators.html) are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you are currently using these functions, please let us know [here](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/t/are-you-using-experimental-strptime-or-experimental-strftime/545).

### SQL Language Changes

- SQL variables can now be reset to their default values with the `RESET` statement or `SET x TO DEFAULT`. [#14105](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14105)
- Schema changes within transactions are now restricted. Certain combinations of schema changes with other statements (which would previously hang) will now return an error. It is recommended that DDL statements be issued outside of transactions, or as the only statement within a transaction. [#14368](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14368)
- [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](rollback.html) is now allowed at any time, not only after receiving a "retry transaction" error. [#14538](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14538)
- [`SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION`](show-transaction.html) and [`SHOW TRANSACTION PRIORITY`](show-transaction.html) are now only allowed during a [transaction](transactions.html). [#14491](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14491)
- [SQL user names](create-user.html) are now required to start with a letter, contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, and be no longer than 63 characters. [#14525](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14525)
- The [`BYTES`](bytes.html) type name is now reported as `bytea` in `pg_catalog.pg_type` for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#14495](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14495)
- The PostgreSQL type IO functions (like `int8in`, `int8out`, `int8send`, and `int8recv`) have dummy implementations for compatibility with some ORMs. [#14529](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14529)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- Command history no longer corrupts previous commands when normalizing them. [#14496](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14496)
- The [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) no longer uses the `COCKROACH_PORT` environment variable; the port must be set on the server's command line (similar to `--host` and other flags). [#14612](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14612)

### Admin UI Changes

- The **Node List** page has been improved. [#14395](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14395)
- A new `node-id` metric with labels for the node's address is now exported for use in external monitoring systems. [#14544](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14544)

### Performance Improvements

- A single `TimestampCache` is now shared by all replicas on a store, providing better control over memory usage and better support for large transactions. [#14489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14489)
- Reduced memory used by the `TimestampCache`. [#14516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14516) [#14514](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14514)
- Replica garbage collection is now much more efficient. [#14391](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14391)
- [Adding](add-column.html) and [dropping](drop-column.html) columns now uses the distributed SQL engine. [#14331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14331)

### Bug Fixes

- [`INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](insert.html#update-values-on-conflict) no longer uses an error-prone optimization. The [`UPSERT`](upsert.html) statement is now faster than the equivalent `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement. [#14485](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14485)
- Joining nodes of two different clusters is now detected more reliably. [#14475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14475)
- Fixed a panic during prepared [`UPDATE`](update.html) statements. [#14481](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14481)
- [`FLOAT`](float.html) and [`DECIMAL`](decimal.html) values in primary keys and indexes now consider `0` and `-0` equal (although the sign will correctly be retained). [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)
- [`DECIMAL`](decimal.html) values in primary keys and indexes no longer have zeros truncated. If a secondary index contains a `DECIMAL` value with trailing zeros, you can [drop](drop-index.html) and [re-create](create-index.html) the index to have the value returned correctly when the index is used. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

### Doc Updates

- Expanded the [Build a Ruby App with CockroachDB](build-a-ruby-app-with-cockroachdb-activerecord.html) tutorial to feature the ActiveRecord ORM. [#1234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1234)
- Clarified the `--store` flag in the documentation for the [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) command. [#1243](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1243)
- Updated the [build from source](install-cockroachdb.html) instructions to use a source tarball instead of the `cockroach` GitHub repository. The source tarball downloads faster and doesn't need to be extracted in the `GOPATH`. Developers who want to contribute to CockroachDB should use the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) instead.
