### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- The implementation of indexing for collated string columns has changed. Any indexes containing collated strings must be dropped and recreated. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

### SQL Language Changes

- SQL variables can now be reset to their default values with the `RESET` statement or `SET x TO DEFAULT`. [#14105](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14105)
- Schema changes within transactions are now restricted. Certain combinations of schema changes with other statements (which would previously hang) will now return an error. It is recommended that DDL statements be issued outside of transactions, or as the only statement within a transaction. [#14368](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14368)
- `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` is now allowed at any time, not only after receiving a "retry transaction" error. [#14538](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14538)
- `SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION` and `SHOW TRANSACTION PRIORITY` are now only allowed during a transaction. [#14491](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14491)
- SQL user names are now required to start with a letter, contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, and be no longer than 63 characters. [#14525](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14525)
- The `BYTES` type name is now reported as `bytea` in `pg_catalog.pg_type` for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#14495](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14495)
- The PostgreSQL type IO functions (like `int8in`, `int8out`, `int8send`, and `int8recv`) have dummy implementations for compatibility with some ORMs. [#14529](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14529)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- Command history no longer corrupts previous commands when normalizing them. [#14496](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14496)
- `cockroach start` no longer uses the `COCKROACH_PORT` environment variable; the port must be set on the server's command line (similar to `--host` and other flags). [#14612](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14612)

### Admin UI Changes

- The Node List page has been improved. [#14395](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14395)
- A new `node-id` metric with labels for the node's address is now exported for use in external monitoring systems. [#14544](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14544)

### Performance Improvements

- A single `TimestampCache` is now shared by all replicas on a store, providing better control over memory usage and better support for large transactions. [#14489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14489)
- Reduced memory used by the `TimestampCache`. [#14516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14516) [#14514](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14514)
- Replica garbage collection is now much more efficient. [#14391](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14391)
- Adding and dropping columns now uses the distributed SQL engine. [#14331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14331)

### Bug Fixes

- `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` no longer uses an error-prone optimization. The `UPSERT` syntax is now faster than the equivalent `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement. [#14485](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14485)
- Joining nodes of two different clusters is now detected more reliably. [#14475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14475)
- Fixed a panic during prepared `UPDATE` statements. [#14481](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14481)
