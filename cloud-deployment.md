To deploy an insecure development or test cluster on Google Cloud Engine or AWS using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), see the configuration files and instructions in the [`gce`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/cloud/gce) and [`aws`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/cloud/aws) directories of our main cockroach GitHub repository. 

More cloud deployment docs coming soon.
