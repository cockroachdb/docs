 Changefeeds are supported on [regional by row tables](multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables). When working with changefeeds on regional by row tables, it is necessary to consider the following:

- Setting a table's locality to [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](alter-table.html#regional-by-row) is equivalent to a [schema change](online-schema-changes.html) as the [`crdb_region` column](alter-table.html#crdb_region) becomes a hidden column for each of the rows in the table and is part of the [primary key](primary-key.html). Therefore, when existing tables targeted by changefeeds are made regional by row, it will trigger a backfill of the table through the changefeed. (See [Schema changes with a column backfill](changefeed-messages.html#schema-changes-with-column-backfill) for more details on the effects of schema changes on changefeeds.)

If the [`schema_change_policy`](create-changefeed.html#options) changefeed option is configured to `stop`, the backfill will cause the changefeed to fail.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Setting a table to `REGIONAL BY ROW` will have an impact on the changefeed's output as a result of the schema change. The backfill and future updated or inserted rows will emit output that includes the newly added `crdb_region` column as part of the schema. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that programs consuming the changefeed can manage the new format of the primary keys.

- [Changing a row's region](alter-table.html#update-a-rows-home-region) will appear as an insert and delete in the emitted changefeed output. For example, in the following output in which the region has been updated to `us-east1`, the insert messages are emitted followed by the [delete messages](changefeed-messages.html#delete-messages):
