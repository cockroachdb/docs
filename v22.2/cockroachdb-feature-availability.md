Some CockroachDB features are made available in phases prior to being launched in general availability (GA). This page defines the different levels of CockroachDB {{ page.version.version }} feature availability and lists the features in each phase.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
This page outlines _feature availability_, which is separate from Cockroach Labs' [Release Support Policy](../releases/release-support-policy.html) or [API Support Policy](api-support-policy.html).

## Features in limited access

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
**The following features are in limited access** and are only available to enrolled organizations. To enroll your organization, contact your Cockroach Labs account team. These features are subject to change.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Export logs from {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters

{{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can use the [Cloud API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html) to configure [log export](../cockroachcloud/export-logs.html) to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) or [GCP Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging). Once the export is configured, logs will flow from all nodes in all regions of your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster to your chosen cloud log sink. You can configure log export to redact sensitive log entries, limit log output by severity, and send log entries to specific log group targets by log channel, among others.

### Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}

[Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)](../cockroachcloud/cmek.html) allow you to protect data at rest in a {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster using a cryptographic key that is entirely within your control, hosted in a supported key-management system (KMS) platform.

### Egress perimeter controls for {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}

[Egress Perimeter Controls](../cockroachcloud/egress-perimeter-controls.html) can enhance the security of {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters by enabling cluster administrators to restrict egress to a list of specified external destinations. This adds a strong layer of protection against malicious or accidental data exfiltration.

### Private {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters

Limiting access to a CockroachDB cluster's nodes over the public internet is an important security practice and is also a compliance requirement for many organizations. [{{ site.data.products.dedicated }} private clusters](../cockroachcloud/private-clusters.html) allow organizations to meet this objective. A private {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster's nodes have no public IP addresses, and egress traffic moves over private subnets and through a highly-available NAT gateway that is unique to the cluster.

### Export Cloud Organization audit logs (Cloud API)

{{ site.data.products.db }} captures audit logs when many types of events occur, such as when a cluster is created or when a user is added to or removed from an organization. Any user in an organization with an admin-level service account can [export these audit logs](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-audit-logs.html) using the [`auditlogevents` endpoint](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html#cloud-audit-logs) of the [Cloud API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html).

## Features in preview

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
**The following features are in preview** and are subject to change. To share feedback and/or issues, contact [Support](https://support.cockroachlabs.com/hc/en-us).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Export metrics from {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters

{{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can use the [Cloud API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html) to configure [metrics export](../cockroachcloud/export-metrics.html) to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). Once the export is configured, metrics will flow from all nodes in all regions of your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster to your chosen cloud metrics sink.

### Keep SQL audit logs

Log all queries against a table to a file, for security purposes. For more information, see [`ALTER TABLE ... EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT`](alter-table.html#experimental_audit).

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE t EXPERIMENTAL_AUDIT SET READ WRITE;
~~~

### Show table fingerprints

Table fingerprints are used to compute an identification string of an entire table, for the purpose of gauging whether two tables have the same data. This is useful, for example, when restoring a table from backup.

Example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW EXPERIMENTAL_FINGERPRINTS FROM TABLE t;
~~~

~~~
 index_name |     fingerprint
------------+---------------------
 primary    | 1999042440040364641
(1 row)
~~~

### Turn on KV event tracing

Use session tracing (via [`SHOW TRACE FOR SESSION`](show-trace.html)) to report the replicas of all KV events that occur during its execution.

Example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SET tracing = on;
> SELECT * from t;
> SET tracing = off;
> SHOW EXPERIMENTAL_REPLICA TRACE FOR SESSION;
~~~

~~~
            timestamp             | node_id | store_id | replica_id
----------------------------------+---------+----------+------------
 2018-10-18 15:50:13.345879+00:00 |       3 |        3 |          7
 2018-10-18 15:50:20.628383+00:00 |       2 |        2 |         26
~~~

### Check for constraint violations with `SCRUB`

Checks the consistency of [`UNIQUE`](unique.html) indexes, [`CHECK`](check.html) constraints, and more.  Partially implemented; see [cockroachdb/cockroach#10425](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/10425) for details.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
This example uses the `users` table from our open-source, fictional peer-to-peer vehicle-sharing application, [MovR](movr.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
>  EXPERIMENTAL SCRUB table movr.users;
~~~

### Show range information for a specific row

The [`SHOW RANGE ... FOR ROW`](show-range-for-row.html) statement shows information about a [range](architecture/overview.html#architecture-range) for a particular row of data. This information is useful for verifying how SQL data maps to underlying ranges, and where the replicas for a range are located.

### Alter column types

CockroachDB supports [altering the column types](alter-table.html#alter-column-data-types) of existing tables, with certain limitations. To enable altering column types, set the `enable_experimental_alter_column_type_general` [session variable](show-vars.html) to `true`.

### Temporary objects

[Temporary tables](temporary-tables.html), [temporary views](views.html#temporary-views), and [temporary sequences](create-sequence.html#temporary-sequences) are in preview in CockroachDB. If you create too many temporary objects in a session, the performance of DDL operations will degrade. Performance limitations could persist long after creating the temporary objects. For more details, see [cockroachdb/cockroach#46260](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/46260).

To enable temporary objects, set the `experimental_enable_temp_tables` [session variable](show-vars.html) to `on`. 

### Password authentication without TLS

For deployments where transport security is already handled at the infrastructure level (e.g., IPSec with DMZ), and TLS-based transport security is not possible or not desirable, CockroachDB supports delegating transport security to the infrastructure with the flag `--accept-sql-without-tls` for [`cockroach start`](cockroach-start.html#security).

With this flag, SQL clients can establish a session over TCP without a TLS handshake. They still need to present valid authentication credentials, for example a password in the default configuration. Different authentication schemes can be further configured as per `server.host_based_authentication.configuration`.

Example:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --user=jpointsman --insecure
~~~

~~~
  # Welcome to the CockroachDB SQL shell.
  # All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
  # To exit, type: \q.
  #
  Enter password:
~~~

### Core implementation of changefeeds

The [`EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR`](changefeed-for.html) statement creates a new core changefeed, which streams row-level changes to the client indefinitely until the underlying connection is closed or the changefeed is canceled. A core changefeed can watch one table or multiple tables in a comma-separated list.

### Changefeed metrics labels

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/metrics-labels.md %}

For usage details, see the [Monitor and Debug Changefeeds](monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html) page.

### Google Pub/Sub sink for changefeeds

Changefeeds can deliver messages to a [Google Cloud Pub/Sub sink](changefeed-sinks.html#google-cloud-pub-sub), which is integrated with Google Cloud Platform.

### Webhook sink for changefeeds

Use a [webhook sink](changefeed-sinks.html#webhook-sink) to deliver changefeed messages to an arbitrary HTTP endpoint.

### Change data capture transformations

[Change data capture transformations](cdc-transformations.html) allow you to define the change data emitted to your sink when you create a changefeed. The expression syntax provides a way to select columns and apply filters to further restrict or transform the data in your [changefeed messages](changefeed-messages.html).  

### External connections

You can use external connections to specify and interact with resources that are external from CockroachDB. With [`CREATE EXTERNAL CONNECTION`](create-external-connection.html), you define a name for an external connection while passing the provider URI and query parameters.
