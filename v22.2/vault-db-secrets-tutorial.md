---

This tutorial discusses and demonstrates best security practices for managing CockroachDB database credentials with [HashiCorp Vault's database secrets engine PostgreSQL plugin](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases/postgresql).

In the first phase of the tutorial, we will act as administrators, provisioning access to a Vault dynamic secret endpoint for a CockroachDB client operator to use to provision credentials for an app that needs to access the CockroachDB database.

In the second phase, acting as client operator, we will pull credentials from Vault and use them to access the database via the CockroachDB client CLI.

## Before you begin

To follow along with this tutorial you will need the following:

- The CockroachDB CLI [installed locally](install-cockroachdb-mac.html).
- The Vault CLI [installed locally](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads).
- Access to a CockroachDB cluster as [`admin` SQL user](security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). This tutorial will use a {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster, but you may either [Create a {{ site.data.products.serverless }} cluster](../cockroachcloud/create-a-serverless-cluster.html) or [Start a Local Cluster (secure)](start-a-local-cluster.html) in order to follow along. In either case you must have the public CA certificate for your cluster, and a username/password combination for the `root` SQL user (or another SQL user with the [`admin` role](security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role).
- Access to a Vault cluster with an admin token. This tutorial will use HashiCorp Cloud Platform, but you may either [spin up a free cluster in HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/cloud) or [start a development cluster locally](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-dev-server).

## Introduction

Sound strategy and proper tooling for managing database credentials are essential to the overall strength of your security posture. Managing your CockroachDB database credentials with HashiCorp Vault affords several security advantages.

The general advantages of using a delegated, consolidated secrets management solution include:

- Access is managed by a single coherent set of policies.
- Access events leave an audit trail.
- Secrets are properly encrypted in flight and in transit.
- There is no need to store or transmit secrets with multiple tools or tools not designed for the purpose, as typically done in the past.

Advantages of Vault's [Dynamic Secrets](https://www.vaultproject.io/use-cases/dynamic-secrets) model:

- Database credentials are generated and issued only on demand, from pre-configured templates, for specific clients and short validity durations, further minimizing both probability of credential compromise and possible impact of any compromise that does occur.
- Diligent rotation and revocation practices are automated by implication, requiring no additional effort or oversight.

## Step 1: Prepare your shell for CockroachDB and Vault admin tasks

In this phase of the tutorial we will act as an administrator for our organization, provisioning access for a class of database clients. We'll need admin credentials for both a Vault cluster and a CockroachDB cluster, allowing you to create and manage access for roles in both domains.

1. Connect to CockroachDB.

    Set your CockroachDB cluster credentials and other configuration information as environment variables. If you're using a {{ site.data.products.db }} cluster, you can find this information in the [CockroachDB Cloud Console's cluster page.](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/cluster/)

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Your cluster name must include the numerical suffix, which is included in the connection string under the **Connect** tab in the console, but is not included when the cluster name is displayed in the console.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    1. Export the variables to your shell:

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        export USER_NAME=tutorialadmin # replace with CockroachDB admin username
        export PASSWORD=1234asdf # replace with CockroachDB admin password
        export DB_NAME=defaultdb # replace with CockroachDB database name if different
        export CLUSTER_NAME=lilac-grizzly-684 # replace with CockroachDB cluster name
        export HOST=free-tier123.aws-us-west-2.crdb.io # replace with CockroachDB cluster host
        ~~~

    1. Construct a database connection URL for your CockroachDB CLI to connect to the cluster, using your admin credentials:

        {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
        You must place the CockroachDB cluster's CA public certificate on the path specified by `sslrootcert`. In the following example, this is a file named `root.crt` in the current directory.
        {{site.data.alerts.end}}

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        export TLS_OPTS="sslrootcert=root.crt&sslmode=verify-full
        export CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://${USER_NAME}:${PASSWORD}@${HOST}:26257/${DB_NAME}?${TLS_OPTS}"
        ~~~

    1. Obtain your CockroachDB cluster's CA public certificate:

        1. Visit the [CockroachDB Cloud Console's cluster page](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/cluster/).
        1. Select your cluster.
        1. Click the **Connect** button.
        1. Select **"Download CA Cert (Required only once)"** and use the generated `curl` command to download the certificate.

        ~~~shell
        curl --create-dirs -o root.crt -O https://management-staging.crdb.io/clusters/505a138c-37ff-46b7-9c50-4119cf0881f6/cert
        ~~~

1. Prove that your connection works by executing a SQL statement.

    Recall that this command must be run in the directory where `root.crt` is located, as specified in the connection URL.

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    cockroach sql --url "${CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL}" --execute "show tables;"
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    SHOW TABLES 0

    Time: 107ms
    ~~~

1.  Connect to Vault.

    1. Set your Vault target and the `admin` Vault namespace.

        You can fetch your target URL and generate a token from the [HashiCorp Vault console](https://portal.cloud.HashiCorp.com/services/vault), under the **Access Vault** tab.

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        export VAULT_ADDR=https://roach-test-vault.vault.bfb2290a-670b-4a10-bedf-5aab18e84d69.aws.HashiCorp.cloud:8200 # your Vault cluster URL
        export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin
        ~~~

    1. Authenticate to your Vault, providing the admin token when prompted:

        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        vault login
        ~~~
        ~~~
        Success! You are now authenticated...
        ~~~

1. Enable the Vault database secrets engine:

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    This only needs to be done once for an individual Vault cluster. For more information on using the Vault Secrets CLI, see [Vault's documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/secrets).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault secrets enable database
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Success! Enabled the database secrets engine at: database/
    ~~~

## Step 2: Bind your Vault cluster to your CockroachDB cluster

The connection lies in a Vault configuration, which will store your CockroachDB admin credentials, allowing Vault to administrate CockroachDB credentials.

1. Create a Vault database configuration.

    1. First, tweak the connection string to skip TLS server authentication, as there's no way to provision the Vault server with the cluster CA cert:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        <!-- the "raw" block prevents the double curly braces of Vault's interpolation syntax from being interpreted by Jekyll  -->
        ~~~shell
        {% raw %}export VAULT_TLS_OPTS="sslmode=require"
        export VAULT_DB_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://{{username}}:{{password}}@${HOST}:26257/${DB_NAME}?${VAULT_TLS_OPTS}"{% endraw %}
        ~~~

    1. Write the `crdb-config` database configuration to Vault, specifying admin credentials that will be used by Vault to create credentials for your defined role:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        vault write database/config/crdb-config \
        plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin \
        allowed_roles="crdb-role" \
        username=${USER_NAME} \
        password=${PASSWORD} \
        connection_url=${VAULT_DB_CONNECTION_URL}
        ~~~

        ~~~txt
        Success! Data written to: database/config/crdb-config
        ~~~

## Step 3: Provision Dynamic Secrets for SQL credentials

A *dynamic secret* is a secret template, which will be used to generate particular short-lived secrets on demand, according to the template. The secret type we'll be using is `/database/role`. A Vault database role does not correspond to a single role or user in SQL, but a template for creating short-lived roles or users.

For a SQL role, the template is defined by its `creation_statements`, SQL statements that create the role, define its options and grant its permissions.

1. Create a Vault database role.

    For example, create a role that has all privileges on the `defaultdb` database:
    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    `db_name` is actually not the database name but the Vault database secrets engine namespace (i.e., `crdb-config` in the example).
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}
    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell

    {% raw %}vault write database/roles/crdb-role \
        db_name=crdb-config \
        creation_statements="CREATE ROLE \"{{name}}\" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}'; \
            GRANT ALL ON DATABASE defaultdb TO \"{{name}}\";" \
        default_ttl="1h" \
        max_ttl="24h"{% endraw %}
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Success! Data written to: database/roles/crdb-role
    ~~~

1. Query Vault for a list of database roles, revealing the newly created `crdb-role`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault list database/roles/
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Keys
    ----
    crdb-role
    ~~~

1. Inspect the role, revealing the values we set for the role when creating it:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault read database/roles/crdb-role
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Key                      Value
    ---                      -----
    creation_statements      [CREATE ROLE "{% raw %}{{name}}{% endraw %}" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{% raw %}{{password}}{% endraw %}' VALID UNTIL '{% raw %}{{expiration}}{% endraw %}'; GRANT ALL ON DATABASE defaultdb TO "{% raw %}{{name}}{% endraw %}";]
    db_name                  crdb-config
    default_ttl              1h
    max_ttl                  24h
    renew_statements         []
    revocation_statements    []
    rollback_statements      []
    ~~~

1. Generate credential pairs.

    Recall that a *role* in Vault does not correspond exactly to a *role* in CockroachDB (i.e., a [SQL role or user](security-reference/authorization.html#users-and-roles)).

    A Vault role is a defined *template* for credential pairs (SQL user/role name and password), which will be generated on demand and quickly expired.

    When we "read" the Vault role called `crdb-role`, we are therefore not fetching credentials for a pre-existing SQL user, but requesting that Vault create a user for us, according to the template.

    1. To see this, first execute a SQL statement via the CockroachDB CLI to list existing users:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        cockroach sql --url $CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL --execute "show users;"
        ~~~
        ~~~txt
        username | options | member_of
        ---------+---------+------------
        admin    |         | {}
        docsrule |         | {admin}
        root     |         | {admin}
        ~~~

    1. Now, let's read some credentials from Vault, which will cause Vault to create SQL users on our CockroachDB cluster.
        Run the following command several times to generate several credential pairs:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        vault read database/creds/crdb-role
        ~~~
        Notice that the validity duration is the default value of 1 hour.

        ~~~txt
        Key                Value
        ---                -----
        lease_id           database/creds/crdb-role/5rPhNN6aG0dNRs97UmRYMmJH.iMXtW
        lease_duration     1h
        lease_renewable    true
        password           a1qKnD-ZjFG-oUMcSFtx
        username           v-token-hc-crdb-rol-1pcS5YcSaSS4Fgy4BiXp-1653512968
        ~~~

    1. List the active credentials (or *leases*, in Vault terms) for the Vault role:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        vault list sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/crdb-role/
        ~~~
        ~~~txt
        Keys
        ----
        5rPhNN6aG0dNRs97UmRYMmJH.iMXtW
        ATKZIXMXMTcNQBkR4vwzvyd8.iMXtW
        WHtZ4JKGLC8KYssMn5mCxKqU.iMXtW
        lcAOenZ7s03BpPi8XKS0vsK3.iMXtW
        yyufcaLu4eKWcnGzhes30t6M.iMXtW
        ~~~

    1. Now fetch the list of currently active SQL roles from the CockroachDB client:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        cockroach sql --url $CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL --execute "show users;"
        ~~~
        ~~~txt
                               username                       |                options                | member_of
        ------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+------------
          admin                                               |                                       | {}
          root                                                |                                       | {admin}
          v-token-hc-crdb-rol-uqtqyca6neplilakhv55-1653513157 | VALID UNTIL=2022-05-25 22:12:42+00:00 | {}
          v-token-hc-crdb-rol-0gzk3hwi7k7a9w1ggggq-1653515525 | VALID UNTIL=2022-05-25 22:52:10+00:00 | {}
          v-token-hc-crdb-rol-varnevyjgjg9zgf62kps-1653515522 | VALID UNTIL=2022-05-25 22:52:07+00:00 | {}
          v-token-hc-crdb-rol-wltbv25napuroomvzmok-1653515524 | VALID UNTIL=2022-05-25 22:52:09+00:00 | {}
        ~~~

1. Revoke credentials.
    Try revoking a lease. Recall that a *lease* on a *role* in Vault terms corresponds to an actual credential pair on the CockroachDB cluster, i.e., a username/password combination for a SQL user.
    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault lease revoke database/creds/crdb-role/XIpIBRM8FkQxD5B0ndB1lszY.iMXtW
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    All revocation operations queued successfully!
    ~~~

1. Provision a CockroachDB-client Vault policy.

    As admin, provision a Vault policy for CockroachDB client operators to access the client credentials.

    The purpose of the previous work is to make a dynamic secret that can be used to access the CockroachDB database by generating credentials on demand. Performing the above work (establishing the connection between the CockroachDB cluster and the Vault cluster, creating the template for database client credentials, etc.) required admin privileges. But for the work to be meaningful, a Vault user with more limited permissions must be able to access the generated credentials.

    This policy will be used to access CockroachDB client credentials. In keeping with the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), let's give it only the required ability to read the required credential.

    Vault policies are specified using [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)]( https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/main/hclsyntax/spec.md). The following configuration specifies a policy of read access for the `crdb-role` credential:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault policy write roach-client - <<hcl
    path "database/creds/crdb-role" {
      capabilities = [ "read" ]
    }
    hcl
    ~~~
    ~~~
    Success! Uploaded policy: roach-client
    ~~~

1. Generate an authentication token for the `crdb-role` Vault user.

    Our final act as Vault admin will be to provision an authentication token to assume the `crdb-role`: the Vault role with the sole purpose of providing credentials to a CockroachDB client.

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
     vault token create -policy=roach-client
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                hvs.CAESIK4TK7JcSJuKxOgwEa3mYhvfN356Uhikij821K4E4XnWGigKImh2cy5MeUJ5dGNxMjRzNk9qNmVDYWtFYjRUd2QuaU1YdFcQ1cAT
    token_accessor       36udxC5m0hmA0niBYyCThk0k.iMXtW
    token_duration       1h
    token_renewable      true
    token_policies       ["default" "roach-client"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["default" "roach-client"]
    ~~~

    You can either copy the `token` from the output of the previous command, or capture a token with the following command (which requires the shell utility [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)).

    ~~~shell
     VAULT_CLIENT_TOKEN=`vault token create -policy=roach-client -format=json | jq .auth.client_token | tr -d '"'`
    ~~~

## Step 4: Connect to CockroachDB with Vault-provisioned credentials

In this phase of the tutorial, we will use credentials provisioned by Vault to access our CockroachDB cluster, emulating the flow that an application dev ops engineer or application service account might use to achieve database access. Therefore, unlike in the first phase, we will not use Vault admin credentials or CockroachDB credentials acquired other than through Vault, since these should not be required.

1. Authenticate to Vault as the CockroachDB user.

    Use the client token to authenticate to Vault with limited permissions:
    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault login $VAULT_CLIENT_TOKEN
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
    is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
    again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.
    ~~~

1. Confirm the limited permissions of the role.

    To confirm that you have assumed a role with limited permissions, try listing the current leases on the `crdb-role`, as we did [previously](#). You should see a permissions error.

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault list sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/crdb-role/
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Error listing sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/crdb-role: Error making API request.

    Namespace: admin/
    URL: GET https://roach-test-vault.vault.bfb2290a-670b-4a10-bedf-5aab18e84d69.aws.hashicorp.cloud:8200/v1/sys/leases/lookup/database/creds/crdb-role?list=true
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * 1 error occurred:
      * permission denied
    ~~~

1. Pull the CockroachDB credentials.

    The only thing this policy does have permission to do is pull credentials for the CockroachDB cluster. Let's do that:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~shell
    vault read database/creds/crdb-role
    ~~~
    ~~~txt
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           database/creds/crdb-role/V3T4UVxeQ9RYsJAk3jZF1Dhl.iMXtW
    lease_duration     1h
    lease_renewable    true
    password           FlOo0p7jMTXjT27hlZZ-H
    username           v-token-crdb-rol-thfLPlFwex0k9Op0P8qA-1653528652
    ~~~

1. Connect to the CockroachDB cluster with your Vault-generated dynamic secret credentials.

    1. Using the previous output, add the `crdb-role` credentials to your environment:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        export USER_NAME=v-token-crdb-rol-thfLPlFwex0k9Op0P8qA-1653528652 # generated CockroachDB client username
        export PASSWORD=FlOo0p7jMTXjT27hlZZ-H # generated CockroachDB client password
        export DB_NAME=defaultdb
        export CLUSTER_NAME=lilac-grizzly-684 # generated CockroachDB client password
        export HOST=free-tier21.aws-us-west-2.crdb.io
        export TLS_OPTS="sslrootcert=root.crt&sslmode=verify-full"
        export CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://$USER_NAME:$PASSWORD@${HOST}:26257/${DB_NAME}?${TLS_OPTS}"
        ~~~

    1. List all the tables in database `defaultdb` to confirm you can connect to your CockroachDB cluster:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        cockroach sql --url "${CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL}" --execute "show tables;"
        ~~~
        ~~~txt
        SHOW TABLES 0


        Time: 120ms
        ~~~

    1. To confirm that the credentials have been properly limited, attempt a forbidden operation. `crdb-role`  does not have permission to list users, so try that in order to generate a permissions error:
        {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~shell
        cockroach sql --url "${CLI_DB_CONNECTION_URL}" --execute "show users;"
        ~~~
        ~~~txt
        ERROR: user v-token-crdb-rol-thflplfwex0k9op0p8qa-1653528652 does not have SELECT privilege on relation users
        SQLSTATE: 42501
        Failed running "sql"
        ~~~
