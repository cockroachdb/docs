This tutorial shows you how build a simple Go application with CockroachDB and the Go [pq driver](https://github.com/lib/pq).

## Step 1. Start CockroachDB

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/setup/sample-setup.md %}

## Step 2. Get the code

Clone the code's GitHub repo:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cockroachlabs/hello-world-go-pq
~~~

## Step 3. Initialize the database

1. Navigate to the `hello-world-go-pq` directory:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cd hello-world-go-pq
    ~~~

1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string for your cluster:

    <section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="local">

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable"
    ~~~

    </section>

    <section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="cockroachcloud">

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    export DATABASE_URL="{connection-string}"
    ~~~

    Where `{connection-string}` is the connection string you copied earlier.

## Step 4. Run the code

You can now run the code sample (`main.go`) provided in this tutorial to do the following:

- Create a table.
- Insert some rows into the table you created.
- Read values from the table.
- Execute a batch of statements as an atomic [transaction](transactions.html).

    Note that CockroachDB may require the [client to retry a transaction](transactions.html#transaction-retries) in the case of read/write contention. The [CockroachDB Go client](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-go) includes a generic **retry function** (`ExecuteTx()`) that runs inside a transaction and retries it as needed. The code sample shows how you can use this function to wrap SQL statements.

1. Initialize the module:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ go mod init basic-sample && go mod tidy
    ~~~

1. Run the code:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ go run main.go
    ~~~

    The output should be:

    ~~~
    Balances:
    1 1000
    2 250
    Success
    Balances:
    1 900
    2 350
    ~~~
