{% include_cached new-in.html version="v22.2" %} The **Insights** page exposes problems that CockroachDB has detected in your workloads and schemas. The page also offers recommendations to improve the performance of your workloads.

The **Insights** page helps you:

- Identify SQL statements with [high retry counts](transactions.html#automatic-retries), [slow execution](query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#identify-slow-queries), or [suboptimal plans](cost-based-optimizer.html).
- Identify [Indexes](indexes.html) that should be created, altered, replaced, or dropped to improve performance.

## Workload Insights tab

The **Workload Insights** tab displays insights related to transaction and statement executions.

### Transaction Executions view

To display this view, click **Insights** in the left-hand navigation of the DB Console.

The **Transaction Executions** view provides an overview of all transaction executions that have been flagged with insights.

The rows in this page are populated from the [`crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events`](crdb-internal.html#transaction_contention_events) table. The results displayed in the Transaction Executions view will be available as long as the corresponding row in the `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` table exists and as long as the rows in each node use less space than `sql.contention.event_store.capacity`.

Transaction executions with the **High Contention** insight are transactions that experienced contention.

- **Transaction Execution ID**: The execution ID of the latest execution with the transaction fingerprint.
- **Transaction Fingerprint ID**: The transaction fingerprint ID of the latest transaction execution.
- **Transaction Execution**: The transaction fingerprint of the latest transaction execution.
- **Insights**: the insight for the transaction execution.
  - **High Contention**: The transaction execution experienced high contention time according to the threshold set in `sql.insights.latency_threshold`.
- **Start Time (UTC)**: The time the transaction execution started.
- **Contention Time**: The amount of time the transaction execution spent waiting in contention.
- **Application Name**: The name specified by the [`application_name`](show-vars.html#supported-variables) session setting.

The following screenshot shows the execution of a transaction in the [ycsb](cockroach-workload.html#run-the-ycsb-workload) workload flagged with High Contention:

The Insights column shows the name of the insight, in this case **Suboptimal Plan**, the Details column provides details on the insight, and the final column contains a button to perform a query to mitigate the cause of the insight,
in this case to create an index on the ride start time that stores the rider ID.

## Schema Insights view

To display this view, click **Insights** in the left-hand navigation of the DB Console and select **Schema Insights**.

This view lists the indexes that have not been used and should be dropped and or the ones that should be created, altered, or replaced (based on statement execution).

- The drop recommendations are the same as those on the [Databases](ui-databases-page.html) page.
- The create, alter, and replace recommendations are the same as those on the [Explain Plans tab](ui-statements-page.html#insights) on the Statements page. The Explain Plans tab shows all recommendations, however this page shows only the latest recommendations for that statement fingerprint. If you execute a statement again after creating or updating an index, the recommendation disappears.

The following screenshot shows the insight that displays after you run the query described in [Use the right index]({{ link_prefix }}apply-statement-performance-rules.html#rule-2-use-the-right-index) 6 or more times:

<img src="{{ 'images/v22.2/schema_insight.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Schema insight" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

- **Insights:** Contains one of the following insight types: **Create Index**, **Alter Index**, **Replace Index**, **Drop Unused Index**.
- **Details:** Details for each insight. Different insight types display different details fields:

    - **Create Index**, **Alter Index**, or **Replace Index**: a Statement Fingerprint field, which displays the statement fingerprint that would be optimized with the creation, alteration, or replacement of the index, and a Recommendation field, which displays the SQL query to create, alter, or replace the index.
    - **Drop Unused Index**: an Index field, which displays the name of the index to drop, and a Description field, which displays the reason for dropping the index.

To realize the schema insight, click the action button in the final column to execute the SQL statement. A confirmation dialog displays warning you of the cost of [online schema changes](online-schema-changes.html) and a button to copy the SQL statement for later execution in a SQL client.

## Configuration

You can configure the behavior of insights using the following [cluster settings](cluster-settings.html).

### Workload insights settings

You can configure [Workload Insights](#workload-insights-tab) with the following cluster settings.

#### Detect slow executions

There are two different methods for detecting slow executions. By default, they are both enabled and you can configure them based on your workload.

The first method flags all executions running longer than `sql.insights.latency_threshold`. You can think of this as analogous to the [slow query log](logging-use-cases.html#sql_perf).

The second method attempts to detect **unusually slow executions**. You can enable this detection with `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.enabled` and configure it with `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold`.
CockroachDB will then keep a streaming histogram in memory for each distinct statement fingerprint that has seen an execution latency longer than `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold` and flag any execution with a latency in the 99th percentile (`> p99`) for its fingerprint.

Additional controls filter out less actionable executions:

- The execution's latency must also be longer than twice the median latency (`> 2*p50`) for that fingerprint. This ensures that the elevated latency is significant enough to warrant attention.
- The execution's latency must also be longer than `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold`. Slower-than-usual executions are less interesting if they're still fast enough.

The `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.memory_limit` cluster setting limits the amount of memory available for tracking these streaming latency histograms. When this threshold is surpassed, the least-recently touched histogram is evicted. The default of `1 MiB` is sufficient for tracking about a thousand fingerprints.

You can track the `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.memory` and `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.evictions` [metrics](ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html) to determine if the settings are appropriate for your workload. If you see a steady stream of evictions or churn, you can either raise the `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.memory_limit` cluster setting, to allow for more storage, or raise the `sql.insights.anomaly_detection.latency_threshold` cluster setting, to examine fewer statement fingerprints.

### Schema insights settings

You can configure the index recommendations in [Schema Insights view](#schema-insights-view) view, [Explain Plans tab](ui-statements-page.html#insights), and the [Databases page](ui-databases-page.html) with the following cluster settings.

| Setting                                                                | Default value | Description                                                                                                             | Where used                           |

|`sql.metrics.statement_details.index_recommendation_collection.enabled` | `true`        | Whether or not index recommendations are enabled for indexes that could be or are used during statement execution.      | Schema Insights and Explain Plans tab|
|`sql.index_recommendation.drop_unused_duration`                         | `7 days`      | Duration of time an index must be unused before a recommendation to drop it.                                            | Schema Insights and Databases        |
|`sql.metrics.statement_details.max_mem_reported_idx_recommendations`    | `5000`        | The maximum number of reported index recommendations stored in memory.                                                  | Schema Insights and Explain Plans tab|
