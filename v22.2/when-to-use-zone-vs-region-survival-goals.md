A [_survival goal_](multiregion-overview.html#survival-goals) dictates how many simultaneous failure(s) a [multi-region database](multiregion-overview.html) can survive. All tables within the same database operate with the same survival goal. Each database is allowed to have its own survival goal setting.

{% include enterprise-feature.md %}

Allowed survival goals include:

- `ZONE` (default)
- `REGION`

Set a [`ZONE` survival goal](multiregion-overview.html#surviving-zone-failures) if:

- You can accept a single node failure up to an entire zone failure. If multiple zones fail in the same region, the database may become unavailable.

Set a [`REGION` survival goal](multiregion-overview.html#surviving-region-failures) if:

- The database must remain available, even if a region goes down.
- You can accept the performance cost: write latency will be increased by at least as much as the round-trip time to the nearest region. Read performance will be unaffected.
- The database can be or already is configured with 3 or more [database regions](multiregion-overview.html#database-regions). At least three database regions are required to survive region failures.
