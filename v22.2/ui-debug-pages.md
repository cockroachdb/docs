## License and node information

On the right-side of the page, the following information is displayed:

- [**License type**](licensing-faqs.html): Determines if you have access to Enterprise features.
- **Web server**: Indicates the node currently serving your DB Console web session, and allows you to select a different node if desired. To cancel your selection of a different node, click **Reset**. You may also specify this directly in the URL with the `remote_node_id` parameter. For example, use `http://<host>:<http-port>/?remote_node_id=2` to select node `2`. The node selected here is also set as the target node for the **Profiling UI** section.
