Changefeeds work as jobs in CockroachDB, which allows for [monitoring](#monitor-a-changefeed) and [debugging](#debug-a-changefeed) through the [DB Console](ui-overview.html) [**Jobs**](ui-jobs-page.html) page and [`SHOW JOBS`](show-jobs.html) SQL statements using the job ID.

## Monitor a changefeed

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Monitoring is only available for {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Changefeed progress is exposed as a high-water timestamp that advances as the changefeed progresses. This is a guarantee that all changes before or at the timestamp have been emitted. You can monitor a changefeed:

- On the [**Changefeeds** dashboard](ui-cdc-dashboard.html) of the DB Console.
- On the [**Jobs** page](ui-jobs-page.html) of the DB Console. Hover over the high-water timestamp to view the [system time](as-of-system-time.html).
- Using `SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB <job_id>`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB 383870400694353921;
    ~~~
    ~~~
            job_id       |  job_type  |                              description                              | ... |      high_water_timestamp      | ... |
    +--------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ ... +--------------------------------+ ... +
      383870400694353921 | CHANGEFEED | CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE office_dogs INTO 'kafka://localhost:9092' | ... | 1537279405671006870.0000000000 | ... |
    (1 row)
    ~~~

- Setting up an alert on the `changefeed.max_behind_nanos` metric to track when a changefeed's high-water mark timestamp is at risk of falling behind the cluster's [garbage collection window](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-zone-variables). For more information, see [Monitoring and Alerting](monitoring-and-alerting.html#changefeed-is-experiencing-high-latency).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You can use the high-water timestamp to [start a new changefeed where another ended](create-changefeed.html#start-a-new-changefeed-where-another-ended).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Using changefeed metrics labels

{% include feature-phases/preview.md %}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
An {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} license is required to use metrics labels in changefeeds.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/cdc/metrics-labels.md %}

To start a changefeed with a metrics label, set the following cluster setting to `true`:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
SET CLUSTER SETTING server.child_metrics.enabled=true;
~~~

Create the changefeed, passing the `metrics_label` option with the label name as its value:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE movr.rides INTO 'kafka://host:port' WITH metrics_label=rides;
~~~

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE movr.vehicles INTO 'kafka://host:port' WITH metrics_label=vehicles;
~~~

Multiple changefeeds can be added to a label:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE movr.vehicle_location_histories INTO 'kafka://host:port' WITH metrics_label=vehicles;
~~~

`http://{host}:{http-port}/_status/vars` shows the defined changefeed(s) by label and the aggregated metric for all changefeeds. This output also shows the `default` scope, which will include changefeeds started without a metrics label:

~~~
changefeed_running 4
changefeed_running{scope="default"} 1
changefeed_running{scope="rides"} 1
changefeed_running{scope="vehicles"} 2
~~~

~~~
changefeed_emitted_messages 4144
changefeed_emitted_messages{scope="default"} 0
changefeed_emitted_messages{scope="rides"} 2772
changefeed_emitted_messages{scope="vehicles"} 1372
~~~

~~~
changefeed_emitted_bytes 781591
changefeed_emitted_bytes{scope="default"} 0
changefeed_emitted_bytes{scope="rides"} 598034
changefeed_emitted_bytes{scope="vehicles"} 183557
~~~

#### Metrics

| Metric           |  Description | Unit
-------------------+--------------+---------------------------------------------------
`changefeed_running` | Number of currently running changefeeds, including sinkless changefeeds. | Changefeeds
`emitted_messages` | Number of messages emitted, which increments when messages are flushed. | Messages
`emitted_bytes`    | Number of bytes emitted, which increments as messages are flushed. | Bytes
`flushed_bytes`    | Bytes emitted by all changefeeds. This may differ from `emitted_bytes` when [`compression`](create-changefeed.html#compression-opt) is enabled. | Bytes
`changefeed_flushes` | Total number of flushes for a changefeed. | Flushes
`emit_latency`     | Difference between the event's [MVCC](architecture/storage-layer.html#mvcc) timestamp and the time the event was emitted by CockroachDB. | Nanoseconds
`admit_latency`    | Difference between the event's MVCC timestamp and the time the event is put into the memory buffer. | Nanoseconds
`commit_latency`   | Difference between the event's MVCC timestamp and the time it is acknowledged by the [downstream sink](changefeed-sinks.html). If the sink is batching events, then the difference is between the oldest event and when the acknowledgment is recorded. | Nanoseconds
`backfill_count`   | Number of changefeeds currently executing a backfill ([schema change](changefeed-messages.html#schema-changes) or initial scan). | Changefeeds
`sink_batch_hist_nanos` | Time messages spend batched in the sink buffer before being flushed and acknowledged. | Nanoseconds
`flush_hist_nanos` | Time spent flushing messages across all changefeeds. | Nanoseconds
`checkpoint_hist_nanos` | Time spent checkpointing changefeed progress. | Nanoseconds
`error_retries` | Total retryable errors encountered by changefeeds. | Errors
`backfill_pending_ranges` | Number of [ranges](architecture/overview.html#architecture-range) in an ongoing backfill that are yet to be fully emitted. | Ranges
`message_size_hist` | Distribution in the size of emitted messages. | Bytes

## Debug a changefeed

### Using logs

For {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds, [use log information](logging-overview.html) to debug connection issues (i.e., `kafka: client has run out of available brokers to talk to (Is your cluster reachable?)`). Debug by looking for lines in the logs with `[kafka-producer]` in them:

~~~
I190312 18:56:53.535646 585 vendor/github.com/Shopify/sarama/client.go:123  [kafka-producer] Initializing new client
I190312 18:56:53.535714 585 vendor/github.com/Shopify/sarama/client.go:724  [kafka-producer] client/metadata fetching metadata for all topics from broker localhost:9092
I190312 18:56:53.536730 569 vendor/github.com/Shopify/sarama/broker.go:148  [kafka-producer] Connected to broker at localhost:9092 (unregistered)

I190312 18:56:53.537686 585 vendor/github.com/Shopify/sarama/client.go:170  [kafka-producer] Successfully initialized new client
~~~

### Using `SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS`

 For {{ site.data.products.enterprise }} changefeeds, use `SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS` to check the status of your changefeed jobs:

{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS;
~~~

~~~

### Using the DB Console

 On the [**Custom Chart** debug page](ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html) of the DB Console:

1. To add a chart, click **Add Chart**.
2. Select `changefeed.error_retries` from the **Metric Name** dropdown menu.

    A graph of changefeed restarts due to retryable errors will display.
