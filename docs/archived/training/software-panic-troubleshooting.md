## Before you begin

Make sure you have already completed [Data Corruption Troubleshooting](data-corruption-troubleshooting.html) and have a cluster of 3 nodes running.

## Step 1. Simulate the problem

1. In a new terminal, issue a "query of death" against node 3. The query will crash the node, the connection will then fail, and you'll see an error message printed to `stderr`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql \
    --insecure \
    --host=localhost:26259 \
    --execute="SELECT crdb_internal.force_panic('foo');"
    ~~~

    ~~~
    Error: driver: bad connection
    Failed running "sql"
    ~~~

## Step 2. Troubleshoot the problem

In the terminal where node 3 was running, check the `stdout` for details:

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You can also look in the node's full logs at `node3/logs`.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

~~~
E180209 14:47:54.819282 2149 sql/session.go:1370  [client=127.0.0.1:53558,user=root,n1] a SQL panic has occurred!

panic while executing "select crdb_internal.force_panic('foo');": foo

goroutine 2149 [running]:
runtime/debug.Stack(0x8246800, 0xc42038e540, 0x3)
	/usr/local/go/src/runtime/debug/stack.go:24 +0x79

...
~~~

The cause of the panic is clearly identified before the stack trace:

~~~
panic while executing "select crdb_internal.force_panic('foo');": foo
~~~

## Step 3. Resolve the problem

With the cause identified, you should:

1. Update your application to stop issuing the "query of death".

2. Restart the down node.

3. File an issue with Cockroach Labs. We'll cover the ideal way to do this in an upcoming module.

## Step 4. Clean up

In the next lab, you'll start a new cluster from scratch, so take a moment to clean things up.

1. Stop the other CockroachDB nodes:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ pkill -9 cockroach
    ~~~

2. Remove the nodes' data directories:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ rm -rf node1 node2 node3
    ~~~
