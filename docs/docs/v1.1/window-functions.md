CockroachDB supports the application of an aggregate or window function over the subset ("window") of the rows selected by a query.

Docs on this feature are coming soon. In the meantime, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/tutorial-window.html) for an introduction to this topic.
