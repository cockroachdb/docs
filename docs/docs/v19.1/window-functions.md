title: Window Functions
summary: A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

CockroachDB supports the application of a function over a subset of the rows returned by a [selection query][selection-query]. Such a function is known as a _window function_, and it allows you to compute values by operating on more than one row at a time. The subset of rows a window function operates on is known as a _window frame_.

For a complete list of supported window functions, see [Functions and Operators](functions-and-operators.html#window-functions).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
All [aggregate functions][aggregate-functions] can also be used as [window functions][window-functions]. For more information, see the [Examples](#examples) below.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The examples on this page use the `users`, `rides`, and `vehicles` tables from our open-source fictional peer-to-peer ride-sharing application,[MovR](https://github.com/cockroachdb/movr).

## How window functions work

At a high level, window functions work by:

1. Creating a "virtual table" using a [selection query][selection-query].
2. Splitting that table into window frames using an `OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` clause.
3. Applying the window function to each of the window frames created in step 2

For example, consider this query:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT DISTINCT(city),
             SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY city) AS city_revenue
            FROM rides
        ORDER BY city_revenue DESC;
~~~

Its operation can be described as follows (numbered steps listed here correspond to the numbers in the diagram below):

1. The outer `SELECT DISTINCT(city) ... FROM rides` creates a "virtual table" on which the window functions will operate.
2. The window function `SUM(revenue) OVER ()` operates on a window frame containing all rows of the query output.
3. The window function `SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY city)` operates on several window frames in turn; each frame contains the `revenue` columns for a different city (Amsterdam, Boston, L.A., etc.).

## Caveats

The most important part of working with window functions is understanding what data will be in the frame that the window function will be operating on. By default, the window frame includes all of the rows of the partition. If you order the partition, the default frame includes all rows from the first row in the partition to the current row. In other words, adding an `ORDER BY` clause when you create the window frame (e.g., `PARTITION BY x ORDER by y`) has the following effects:

- It makes the rows inside the window frame ordered.
- It changes what rows the function is called on - no longer all of the rows in the window frame, but a subset between the "first" row and the current row.

Another way of saying this is that you can run a window function on either:

- All rows in the window frame created by the  `PARTITION BY` clause, e.g., `SELECT f(x) OVER () FROM z`.
- A subset of the rows in the window frame if the frame is created with `SELECT f(x) OVER (PARTITION BY x ORDER BY y) FROM z`.

Because of this, you should be aware of the behavior of any [aggregate function][aggregate-functions] you use as a [window function][window-functions]. If you are not seeing results you expect from a window function, this behavior may explain why. You may need to specify the frame boundaries explicitly using a *frame clause* such as `ROWS BETWEEN <start> <end> [exclusion]` (fully supported) or `RANGE BETWEEN <start> <end> [exclusion]` (only `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`/`CURRENT ROW`/`UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` supported).
