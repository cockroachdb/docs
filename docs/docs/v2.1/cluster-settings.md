summary: Learn about cluster settings that apply to all nodes of a CockroachDB cluster.
toc: true

Cluster settings apply to all nodes of a CockroachDB cluster and control, for example, whether or not to share diagnostic details with Cockroach Labs as well as advanced options for debugging and cluster tuning.

They can be updated anytime after a cluster has been started, but only by a member of the `admin` role, to which the `root` user belongs by default.

In contrast to cluster-wide settings, node-level settings apply to a single node. They are defined by flags passed to the `cockroach start` command when starting a node and cannot be changed without stopping and restarting the node. For more details, see [Start a Node](start-a-node.html).

## Settings

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Many cluster settings are intended for tuning CockroachDB internals. Before changing these settings, we strongly encourage you to discuss your goals with Cockroach Labs; otherwise, you use them at your own risk.

## View current cluster settings

Use the [`SHOW CLUSTER SETTING`](show-cluster-setting.html) statement.

## Change a cluster setting

Use the [`SET CLUSTER SETTING`](set-cluster-setting.html) statement.

Before changing a cluster setting, please note the following:

- 	Changing a cluster setting is not instantaneous, as the change must be propagated to other nodes in the cluster.

- 	Do not change cluster settings while [upgrading to a new version of CockroachDB](upgrade-cockroach-version.html). Wait until all nodes have been upgraded before you make the change.
