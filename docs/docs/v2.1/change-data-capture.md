<span class="version-tag">New in v2.1:</span> Change data capture (CDC) provides efficient, distributed, row-level change feeds into Apache Kafka for downstream processing such as reporting, caching, or full-text indexing.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
**This feature is under active development** and only works for a [targeted use case](#usage-examples). Please [file a Github issue](file-an-issue.html) if you have feedback on the roadmap.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
CDC is an [enterprise-only](enterprise-licensing.html). There will be a core version in a future release.

## What is change data capture?

While CockroachDB is an excellent system of record, it also needs to coexist with other systems. For example, you might want to keep your data mirrored in full-text indexes, analytics engines, or big data pipelines.

The core feature of CDC is the [changefeed](create-changefeed.html). Changefeeds target an allowlist of tables, called the "watched rows". Every change to a watched row is emitted as a record in a configurable format (JSON or Avro) to a configurable sink ([Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)).

## Ordering guarantees

- In most cases, each version of a row will be emitted once. However, some infrequent conditions (e.g., node failures, network partitions) will cause them to be repeated. This gives our changefeeds an **at-least-once delivery guarantee**.

- Once a row has been emitted with some timestamp, no previously unseen versions of that row will be emitted with a lower timestamp. That is, you will never see a _new_ change for that row at an earlier timestamp.

    For example, if you ran the following:

    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE foo (id INT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT unique_rowid(), name STRING);
    > CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE foo INTO 'kafka://localhost:9092' WITH UPDATED;
    > INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 'Carl');
    > UPDATE foo SET name = 'Petee' WHERE id = 1;
    ~~~

    You'd expect the changefeed to emit:

    ~~~ shell
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 1>}, "id": 1, "name": "Carl"}
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 2>}, "id": 1, "name": "Petee"}
    ~~~

    It is also possible that the changefeed emits an out of order duplicate of an earlier value that you already saw:

    ~~~ shell
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 1>}, "id": 1, "name": "Carl"}
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 2>}, "id": 1, "name": "Petee"}
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 1>}, "id": 1, "name": "Carl"}
    ~~~

    However, you will **never** see an output like the following (i.e., an out of order row that you've never seen before):

    ~~~ shell
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 2>}, "id": 1, "name": "Petee"}
    [1]	{"__crdb__": {"updated": <timestamp 1>}, "id": 1, "name": "Carl"}
    ~~~

- If a row is modified more than once in the same transaction, only the last change will be emitted.

- Rows are sharded between Kafka partitions by the rowâ€™s [primary key](primary-key.html).

- The `UPDATED` option adds an "updated" timestamp to each emitted row. You can also use the `RESOLVED` option to emit periodic "resolved" timestamp messages to each Kafka partition. A **resolved timestamp** is a guarantee that no (previously unseen) rows with a lower update timestamp will be emitted on that partition.

    For example:

    ~~~ shell
    {"__crdb__": {"updated": "1532377312562986715.0000000000"}, "id": 1, "name": "Petee H"}
    {"__crdb__": {"updated": "1532377306108205142.0000000000"}, "id": 2, "name": "Carl"}
    {"__crdb__": {"updated": "1532377358501715562.0000000000"}, "id": 3, "name": "Ernie"}
    {"__crdb__":{"resolved":"1532379887442299001.0000000000"}}
    {"__crdb__":{"resolved":"1532379888444290910.0000000000"}}
    {"__crdb__":{"resolved":"1532379889448662988.0000000000"}}
    ...
    {"__crdb__":{"resolved":"1532379922512859361.0000000000"}}
    {"__crdb__": {"updated": "1532379923319195777.0000000000"}, "id": 4, "name": "Lucky"}
    ~~~

- With duplicates removed, an individual row is emitted in the same order as the transactions that updated it. However, this is not true for updates to two different rows, even two rows in the same table. Resolved timestamp notifications on every Kafka partition can be used to provide strong ordering and global consistency guarantees by buffering records in between timestamp closures.

    Because CockroachDB supports transactions that can affect any part of the cluster, it is not possible to horizontally divide the transaction log into independent changefeeds.

## Schema changes with column backfill

When schema changes with column backfill (e.g., adding a column with a default, adding a computed column, adding a `NOT NULL` column, dropping a column) are made to watched rows, the changefeed will emit some duplicates during the backfill. When it finishes, CockroachDB outputs all watched rows using the new schema.

For example, start with the changefeed created in the [example below](#create-a-changefeed-connected-to-kafka):

~~~ shell
[1]	{"id": 1, "name": "Petee H"}
[2]	{"id": 2, "name": "Carl"}
[3]	{"id": 3, "name": "Ernie"}
~~~

Add a column to the watched table:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER TABLE office_dogs ADD COLUMN likes_treats BOOL DEFAULT TRUE;
~~~

The changefeed emits duplicate records 1, 2, and 3 before outputting the records using the new schema:

~~~ shell
[1]	{"id": 1, "name": "Petee H"}
[2]	{"id": 2, "name": "Carl"}
[3]	{"id": 3, "name": "Ernie"}
[1]	{"id": 1, "name": "Petee H"}  # Duplicate
[2]	{"id": 2, "name": "Carl"}     # Duplicate
[3]	{"id": 3, "name": "Ernie"}    # Duplicate
[1]	{"id": 1, "likes_treats": true, "name": "Petee H"}
[2]	{"id": 2, "likes_treats": true, "name": "Carl"}
[3]	{"id": 3, "likes_treats": true, "name": "Ernie"}
~~~

## Configure a changefeed

### Create

To create a changefeed:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE name INTO 'kafka://host:port';
~~~

For more information, see [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](create-changefeed.html).

### Pause

To pause a changefeed:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> PAUSE JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, see [`PAUSE JOB`](pause-job.html).

### Resume

To resume a paused changefeed:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> RESUME JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, see [`RESUME JOB`](resume-job.html).

### Cancel

To cancel a changefeed:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CANCEL JOB job_id;
~~~

For more information, see [`CANCEL JOB`](cancel-job.html).

## Monitor a changefeed

Changefeed progress is exposed as a high-water timestamp that advances as the changefeed progresses. This is a guarantee that all changes before or at the timestamp have been emitted. You can monitor a changefeed:

- On the [Jobs page](admin-ui-jobs-page.html) of the Admin UI. Hover over the high-water timestamp to view the [system time](as-of-system-time.html).
- Using `crdb_internal.jobs`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM crdb_internal.jobs WHERE job_id = <job_id>;
    ~~~
    ~~~
            job_id       |  job_type  |                              description                               | ... |      high_water_timestamp      | error | coordinator_id
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+ ... +--------------------------------+-------+----------------+
      383870400694353921 | CHANGEFEED | CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE office_dogs2 INTO 'kafka://localhost:9092' | ... | 1537279405671006870.0000000000 |       |              1
    (1 row)
    ~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
You can use the high-water timestamp to [start a new changefeed where another ended](create-changefeed.html#start-a-new-changefeed-where-another-ended).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Usage examples

### Create a changefeed connected to Kafka

In this example, you'll set up a changefeed for a single-node cluster that is connected to a Kafka sink.

1. If you do not already have one, [request a trial enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html).

2. In a terminal window, start `cockroach`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start --insecure --listen-addr=localhost --background
    ~~~

3. Download and extract the [Confluent Open Source platform](https://www.confluent.io/download/) (which includes Kafka).

4. Move into the extracted `confluent-<version>` directory and start Confluent:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/confluent start
    ~~~

    Only `zookeeper` and `kafka` are needed. To troubleshoot Confluent, see [their docs](https://docs.confluent.io/current/installation/installing_cp.html#zip-and-tar-archives).

5. Create a Kafka topic:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/kafka-topics \
    --create \
    --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
    --replication-factor 1 \
    --partitions 1 \
    --topic office_dogs
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    You are expected to create any Kafka topics with the necessary number of replications and partitions. [Topics can be created manually](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_add_topic) or [Kafka brokers can be configured to automatically create topics](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs) with a default partition count and replication factor.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

6. As the `root` user, open the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure
    ~~~

7. Set your organization name and [enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html) key that you received via email:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.organization = '<organization name>';
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = '<secret>';
    ~~~

8. Create a database called `cdc_demo`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE cdc_demo;
    ~~~

9. Set the database as the default:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET DATABASE = cdc_demo;
    ~~~

10. Create a table and add data:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE office_dogs (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name STRING);
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO office_dogs VALUES
       (1, 'Petee'),
       (2, 'Carl');
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > UPDATE office_dogs SET name = 'Petee H' WHERE id = 1;
    ~~~

11. Start the changefeed:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE office_dogs INTO 'kafka://localhost:9092';
    ~~~
    ~~~

            job_id       
    +--------------------+
      360645287206223873
    (1 row)
    ~~~

    This will start up the changefeed in the background and return the `job_id`. The changefeed writes to Kafka.

12. In a new terminal, move into the extracted `confluent-<version>` directory and start watching the Kafka topic:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/kafka-console-consumer \
    --bootstrap-server=localhost:9092 \
    --property print.key=true \
    --from-beginning \
    --topic=office_dogs
    ~~~

    ~~~ shell
    [1]	{"id": 1, "name": "Petee H"}
    [2]	{"id": 2, "name": "Carl"}
    ~~~

    Note that the initial scan displays the state of the table as of when the changefeed started (therefore, the initial value of `"Petee"` is omitted).

13. Back in the SQL client, insert more data:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO office_dogs VALUES (3, 'Ernie');
    ~~~

14. Back in the terminal where you're watching the Kafka topic, the following output has appeared:

    ~~~ shell
    [3]	{"id": 3, "name": "Ernie"}
    ~~~

15. When you are done, exit the SQL shell (`\q`).

16. To stop `cockroach`, run:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure
    ~~~

17. To stop Kafka, move into the extracted `confluent-<version>` directory and stop Confluent:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/confluent stop
    ~~~

### Create a changefeed in Avro connected to Kafka

In this example, you'll set up a changefeed for a single-node cluster that is connected to a Kafka sink and emits [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html) records.

1. If you do not already have one, [request a trial enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html).

2. In a terminal window, start `cockroach`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach start --insecure --listen-addr=localhost --background
    ~~~

3. Download and extract the [Confluent Open Source platform](https://www.confluent.io/download/) (which includes Kafka).

4. Move into the extracted `confluent-<version>` directory and start Confluent:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/confluent start
    ~~~

    Only `zookeeper`, `kafka`, and `schema-registry` are needed. To troubleshoot Confluent, see [their docs](https://docs.confluent.io/current/installation/installing_cp.html#zip-and-tar-archives).

5. Create a Kafka topic:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/kafka-topics \
    --create \
    --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
    --replication-factor 1 \
    --partitions 1 \
    --topic office_dogs
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    You are expected to create any Kafka topics with the necessary number of replications and partitions. [Topics can be created manually](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_add_topic) or [Kafka brokers can be configured to automatically create topics](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs) with a default partition count and replication factor.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

6. As the `root` user, open the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure
    ~~~

7. Set your organization name and [enterprise license](enterprise-licensing.html) key that you received via email:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.organization = '<organization name>';
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = '<secret>';
    ~~~

8. Create a database called `cdc_demo`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE cdc_demo;
    ~~~

9. Set the database as the default:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET DATABASE = cdc_demo;
    ~~~

10. Create a table and add data:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE office_dogs (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name STRING);
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO office_dogs VALUES
       (1, 'Petee'),
       (2, 'Carl');
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > UPDATE office_dogs SET name = 'Petee H' WHERE id = 1;
    ~~~

11. Start the changefeed:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE office_dogs INTO 'kafka://localhost:9092' WITH format = 'experimental-avro', confluent_schema_registry = 'http://localhost:8081';
    ~~~

    ~~~
            job_id       
    +--------------------+
      360645287206223873
    (1 row)
    ~~~

    This will start up the changefeed in the background and return the `job_id`. The changefeed writes to Kafka.

12. In a new terminal, move into the extracted `confluent-<version>` directory and start watching the Kafka topic:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/kafka-avro-console-consumer \
    --bootstrap-server=localhost:9092 \
    --property print.key=true \
    --from-beginning \
    --topic=office_dogs
    ~~~

    ~~~ shell
    {"id":1}    {"id":1,"name":{"string":"Petee H"}}
    {"id":2}    {"id":2,"name":{"string":"Carl"}}
    ~~~

    Note that the initial scan displays the state of the table as of when the changefeed started (therefore, the initial value of `"Petee"` is omitted).

13. Back in the SQL client, insert more data:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO office_dogs VALUES (3, 'Ernie');
    ~~~

14. Back in the terminal where you're watching the Kafka topic, the following output has appeared:

    ~~~ shell
    {"id":3}    {"id":3,"name":{"string":"Ernie"}}
    ~~~

15. When you are done, exit the SQL shell (`\q`).

16. To stop `cockroach`, run:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach quit --insecure
    ~~~

17. To stop Kafka, move into the extracted `confluent-<version>` directory and stop Confluent:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ ./bin/confluent stop
    ~~~
