CockroachDB supports the following SQL functions and operators for use in [scalar expressions](scalar-expressions.html).

## Special syntax forms

The following syntax forms are recognized for compatibility with the
SQL standard and PostgreSQL, but are equivalent to regular built-in
functions:

{% include {{ page.version.version }}/sql/function-special-forms.md %}

## Function volatility

A function's _volatility_ is a promise to the [optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.html) about the behavior of the function.

Type   | Description | Examples
-------|-------------|----------
Volatile | The function can modify the state of the database and is not guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments in any context. | `random`, `crdb_internal.force_error`, `nextval`, `now`
Stable | The function is guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments whenever it is evaluated within the same statement. The optimizer can optimize multiple calls of the function to a single call. | `current_timestamp`, `current_date`
Immutable | The function does not depend on configuration settings and is guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments in any context.  The optimizer can pre-evaluate the function when a query calls it with constant arguments. | `log`, `from_json`
Leakproof | The function does not depend on configuration settings and is guaranteed to return the same results given the same arguments in any context. In addition, no information about the arguments is conveyed except via the return value. Any function that might throw an error depending on the values of its arguments is not leakproof. Leakproof is strictly stronger than Immutable. | Integer [comparison](#comparison-functions)

## Conditional and function-like operators

The following table lists the operators that look like built-in
functions but have special evaluation rules:

 Operator | Description
----------|-------------
 `ANNOTATE_TYPE(...)` | [Explicitly Typed Expression](scalar-expressions.html#explicitly-typed-expressions)
 `ARRAY(...)` | [Conversion of Subquery Results to An Array](scalar-expressions.html#conversion-of-subquery-results-to-an-array)
 `ARRAY[...]` | [Conversion of Scalar Expressions to An Array](scalar-expressions.html#array-constructors)
 `CAST(...)` | [Type Cast](scalar-expressions.html#explicit-type-coercions)
 `COALESCE(...)` | [First non-NULL expression with Short Circuit](scalar-expressions.html#coalesce-and-ifnull-expressions)
 `EXISTS(...)` | [Existence Test on the Result of Subqueries](scalar-expressions.html#existence-test-on-the-result-of-subqueries)
 `IF(...)` | [Conditional Evaluation](scalar-expressions.html#if-expressions)
 `IFNULL(...)` | Alias for `COALESCE` restricted to two operands
 `NULLIF(...)` | [Return `NULL` conditionally](scalar-expressions.html#nullif-expressions)
 `ROW(...)` | [Tuple Constructor](scalar-expressions.html#tuple-constructors)

## Aggregate functions

For examples showing how to use aggregate functions, see [the `SELECT` clause documentation](select-clause.html#aggregate-functions).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
Non-commutative aggregate functions are sensitive to the order in which the rows are processed in the surrounding [`SELECT` clause](select-clause.html#aggregate-functions). To specify the order in which input rows are processed, you can add an [`ORDER BY`](order-by.html) clause within the function argument list. For examples, see the [`SELECT` clause](select-clause.html#order-aggregate-function-input-rows-by-column) documentation.

## Operators

The following table lists all CockroachDB operators from highest to lowest precedence, i.e., the order in which they will be evaluated within a statement. Operators with the same precedence are left associative. This means that those operators are grouped together starting from the left and moving right.

| 1 | `.` | Member field access operator | binary |

<!--
## `CAST()`

there are three syntaxes for dates: `'2016-01-01'::date`, `CAST('2016-01-01' AS DATE)`, and `DATE '2016-01-01'`. the docs should probably prefer the latter form

the `CAST()` function should get its own documentation somewhere; Iâ€™m not sure if it needs to be mentioned again in the date section. The `::` form should probably only be mentioned as an alternative to `CAST()`
