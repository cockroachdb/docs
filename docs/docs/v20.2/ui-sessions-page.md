On a secure cluster, this area of the DB Console can only be accessed by a SQL user with the [`VIEWACTIVITY`](authorization.html#create-and-manage-users) role option. Note that non-`admin` users will see only their own sessions, while `admin` users see sessions for all users.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<span class="version-tag">New in v20.2:</span> The **Sessions** page of the DB Console provides details of all open sessions in the cluster.

To view this page, [access the DB Console](ui-overview.html#db-console-access) and click **Sessions** in the left-hand navigation.

## Sessions list

Use the **Sessions** list to see the open sessions in the cluster. This includes active and idle sessions.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
A session is *active* if it has an open transaction (including implicit transactions, which are individual SQL statements), and *idle* if it has no open transaction. Active sessions consume hardware resources.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

- If a session is active, the most recent SQL statement is displayed in the **Statement** column.
- If a session is idle, **Transaction Duration**, **Statement Duration**, and **Statement** will display `N/A`.
- To view [details of a session](#session-details), click the **Session Duration**.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
An active session can have an open transaction that is not currently running SQL. In this case, the **Statement** and **Statement Duration** columns will display `N/A` and **Transaction Duration** will display a value. Transactions that are held open can cause [contention](performance-best-practices-overview.html#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention).

The following are displayed for each active session:

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
Session Age | Amount of time the session has been open.
Txn Duration | Amount of time the transaction has been active, if there is an open transaction.
Statement Age | Amount of time the SQL statement has been active, if there is an active statement.
Memory Usage | Amount of memory currently allocated to this session / maximum amount of memory this session has ever been allocated.
Statement | Active SQL statement. If more than one statement is active, the most recent statement is shown.
Actions | Options to terminate the active query and/or terminate the session. These require the [`CANCELQUERY` role option](authorization.html#create-and-manage-users).<br><br>**Terminate Statement:** Ends the SQL statement. The session running this statement will receive an error.<br><br>**Terminate Session:** Ends the session. The client that holds this session will receive a "connection terminated" event.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
Sort by **Txn Duration** to display all active sessions at the top.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}
