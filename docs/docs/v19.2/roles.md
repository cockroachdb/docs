Roles are SQL groups that contain any number of users and roles as members. To create and manage your cluster's roles, use the following statements:

- [`CREATE ROLE` (Enterprise)](create-role.html)
- [`DROP ROLE` (Enterprise)](drop-role.html)
- [`GRANT <roles>`](grant-roles.html)
- [`REVOKE <roles>`](revoke-roles.html)
- [`GRANT <privileges>`](grant.html)
- [`REVOKE <privileges>`](revoke.html)
- [`SHOW ROLES`](show-roles.html)
- [`SHOW GRANTS`](show-grants.html)


## Terminology

To get started, basic role terminology is outlined below:

Term | Description
-----|------------
Role | A group containing any number of [users](create-user.html) or other roles.<br><br>Note: All users belong to the `public` role, to which you can [grant](grant.html) and [revoke](revoke.html) privileges.
Role admin | A member of the role that's allowed to modify role membership. To create a role admin, use [`WITH ADMIN OPTION`](grant-roles.html#grant-the-admin-option).
Superuser / Admin | A member of the `admin` role. Only superusers can [`CREATE ROLE`](create-role.html) or [`DROP ROLE`](drop-role.html). The `admin` role is created by default and cannot be dropped.
`root` | A user that exists by default as a member of the `admin` role. The `root` user must always be a member of the `admin` role.
Inherit | The behavior that grants a role's privileges to its members.
Direct member | A user or role that is an immediate member of the role.<br><br>Example: `A` is a member of `B`.
Indirect member | A user or role that is a member of the role by association. <br><br>Example: `A` is a member of `C` ... is a member of `B` where "..." is an arbitrary number of memberships.

## Example

For the purpose of this example, you need one CockroachDB node running in insecure mode:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach start \
--insecure \
--store=roles \
--listen-addr=localhost:26257
~~~

1. As the `root` user, open the [built-in SQL client](cockroach-sql.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure
    ~~~

2. [Create a user](create-user.html), `maxroach`:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER maxroach;
    ~~~

3. [Create a database](create-database.html) and [set it as the default](set-vars.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE test_roles;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SET DATABASE = test_roles;
    ~~~

4. [Create a role](create-role.html) and then [list all roles](show-roles.html) in your database:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE ROLE system_ops;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW ROLES;
    ~~~

    ~~~
    +------------+
    |  rolename  |
    +------------+
    | admin      |
    | system_ops |
    +------------+
    ~~~

5. Grant privileges to the `system_ops` role you created:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT CREATE, SELECT ON DATABASE test_roles TO system_ops;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE test_roles;
    ~~~

    ~~~
    +------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
    |  Database  |       Schema       |    User    | Privileges |
    +------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
    | test_roles | crdb_internal      | admin      | ALL        |
    | test_roles | crdb_internal      | root       | ALL        |
    | test_roles | crdb_internal      | system_ops | CREATE     |
    | test_roles | crdb_internal      | system_ops | SELECT     |
    | test_roles | information_schema | admin      | ALL        |
    | test_roles | information_schema | root       | ALL        |
    | test_roles | information_schema | system_ops | CREATE     |
    | test_roles | information_schema | system_ops | SELECT     |
    | test_roles | pg_catalog         | admin      | ALL        |
    | test_roles | pg_catalog         | root       | ALL        |
    | test_roles | pg_catalog         | system_ops | CREATE     |
    | test_roles | pg_catalog         | system_ops | SELECT     |
    | test_roles | public             | admin      | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public             | root       | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public             | system_ops | CREATE     |
    | test_roles | public             | system_ops | SELECT     |
    +------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
    ~~~

6. Add the `maxroach` user to the `system_ops` role:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > GRANT system_ops TO maxroach;
    ~~~

7. To test the privileges you just added to the `system_ops` role, use `\q` or `ctrl-d` to exit the interactive shell, and then open the shell again as the `maxroach` user (who is a member of the `system_ops` role):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --user=maxroach --database=test_roles --insecure
    ~~~

8. As the `maxroach` user, create a table:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE employees (
        id UUID DEFAULT uuid_v4()::UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        profile JSONB
      );
    ~~~

    We were able to create the table because `maxroach` has `CREATE` privileges.

9. As the `maxroach` user, try to drop the table:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > DROP TABLE employees;
    ~~~

    ~~~
    pq: user maxroach does not have DROP privilege on relation employees
    ~~~

    You cannot drop the table because your current user (`maxroach`) is a member of the `system_ops` role, which doesn't have `DROP` privileges.

10. `maxroach` has `CREATE` and `SELECT` privileges, so try a `SHOW` statement:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE employees;
    ~~~

    ~~~
    +------------+--------+-----------+------------+------------+
    |  Database  | Schema |   Table   |    User    | Privileges |
    +------------+--------+-----------+------------+------------+
    | test_roles | public | employees | admin      | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public | employees | root       | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public | employees | system_ops | CREATE     |
    | test_roles | public | employees | system_ops | SELECT     |
    +------------+--------+-----------+------------+------------+
    ~~~

11. Now switch back to the `root` user to test more of the SQL statements related to roles. Use `\q` or `ctrl-d` to exit the interactive shell, and then open the shell again as the `root` user:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ cockroach sql --insecure
    ~~~

12. As the `root` user, revoke privileges and then drop the `system_ops` role:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE test_roles FROM system_ops;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE test_roles;
    ~~~
    ~~~
    +------------+--------------------+-------+------------+
    |  Database  |       Schema       | User  | Privileges |
    +------------+--------------------+-------+------------+
    | test_roles | crdb_internal      | admin | ALL        |
    | test_roles | crdb_internal      | root  | ALL        |
    | test_roles | information_schema | admin | ALL        |
    | test_roles | information_schema | root  | ALL        |
    | test_roles | pg_catalog         | admin | ALL        |
    | test_roles | pg_catalog         | root  | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public             | admin | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public             | root  | ALL        |
    +------------+--------------------+-------+------------+
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > REVOKE ALL ON TABLE test_roles.* FROM system_ops;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE test_roles.*;
    ~~~
    ~~~
    +------------+--------+-----------+-------+------------+
    |  Database  | Schema |   Table   | User  | Privileges |
    +------------+--------+-----------+-------+------------+
    | test_roles | public | employees | admin | ALL        |
    | test_roles | public | employees | root  | ALL        |
    +------------+--------+-----------+-------+------------+
    ~~~

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}All of a role or user's privileges must be revoked before it can be dropped.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > DROP ROLE system_ops;
    ~~~
