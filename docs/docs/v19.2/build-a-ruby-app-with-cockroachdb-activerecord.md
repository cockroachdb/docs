This tutorial shows you how build a simple Ruby application with CockroachDB and the ActiveRecord ORM.

We have tested the [ActiveRecord ORM](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) enough to claim **beta-level** support in CockroachDB v19.2. If you encounter problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/new) with details to help us make progress toward full support.

## Before you begin

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/before-you-begin.md %}

## Step 1. Install the ActiveRecord ORM

To install ActiveRecord as well as the [pg driver](https://rubygems.org/gems/pg) and a [CockroachDB Ruby package](https://github.com/cockroachdb/activerecord-cockroachdb-adapter) that accounts for some minor differences between CockroachDB and PostgreSQL, run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ gem install activerecord pg activerecord-cockroachdb-adapter
~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
The exact command above will vary depending on the desired version of ActiveRecord. Specifically, version 4.2.x of ActiveRecord requires version 0.1.x of the adapter; version 5.1.x of ActiveRecord requires version 0.2.x of the adapter; version 5.2.x of ActiveRecord requires version 5.2.x of the adapter.

## Step 2. Create the `maxroach` user and `bank` database

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/create-maxroach-user-and-bank-database.md %}

## Step 3. Generate a certificate for the `maxroach` user

Create a certificate and key for the `maxroach` user by running the following command. The code samples will run as this user.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach cert create-client maxroach --certs-dir=certs --ca-key=my-safe-directory/ca.key
~~~

## Step 4. Run the Ruby code

The following code uses the [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) ORM to map Ruby-specific objects to SQL operations. Specifically, `Schema.new.change()` creates an `accounts` table based on the Account model (or drops and recreates the table if it already exists), `Account.create()` inserts rows into the table, and `Account.all` selects from the table so that balances can be printed.

Copy the code or
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/{{ page.version.version }}/app/activerecord-basic-sample.rb" download>download it directly</a>.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ ruby
{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/activerecord-basic-sample.rb %}
~~~

Then run the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ ruby activerecord-basic-sample.rb
~~~

The output should be:

~~~
-- create_table(:accounts, {:force=>true})
   -> 0.0361s
1 1000
2 250
~~~

To verify that the table and rows were created successfully, start the [built-in SQL client](cockroach-sql.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --certs-dir=certs --database=bank
~~~

Then, issue the following statement:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT id, balance FROM accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |    1000 |
|  2 |     250 |
+----+---------+
(2 rows)
~~~

{% include {{page.version.version}}/app/insecure/activerecord-basic-sample.rb %}
~~~

~~~

The output should be:

~~~
-- create_table(:accounts, {:force=>true})
   -> 0.0361s
1 1000
2 250
~~~

To verify that the table and rows were created successfully, start the [built-in SQL client](cockroach-sql.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure --database=bank
~~~

Then, issue the following statement:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT id, balance FROM accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |    1000 |
|  2 |     250 |
+----+---------+
(2 rows)
