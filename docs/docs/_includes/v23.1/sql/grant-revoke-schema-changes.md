`GRANT` and `REVOKE` operations are [schema changes](online-schema-changes.html).  As such they inherit the [limitations of schema changes](online-schema-changes.html#limitations).

For example, schema changes wait for concurrent transactions using the same resources as the schema changes to complete. In the case of [role memberships](security-reference/authorization.html#roles) being modified by `GRANT` and `REVOKE` inside a transaction, most transactions need access to the set of role memberships.

This means that [long-running transactions](query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#hanging-or-stuck-queries) elsewhere in the system can cause `GRANT` and `REVOKE` operations inside transactions to take several minutes to complete. This can have a cascading effect. When a `GRANT` or `REVOKE` operation inside a transaction takes a long time to complete, it can in turn block all user-initiated transactions being run by your application, since the `GRANT` operation in the transaction has to commit before any other transactions that access role memberships (i.e., most transactions) can make progress.

If you would prefer that grant and revoke operations finish rapidly, and do not care whether concurrent transactions will immediately see the side-effects of those operations, set the session variable `allow_role_memberships_to_change_during_transaction` to `true`.

When enabled, this session variable means that the grant or revoke operations issued in the current session will only need to wait for the completion of statements in other sessions which do not have that session variable set. To accelerate grant and revoke operations across your entire application, you can set the session variable in all sessions by [passing it in the client connection string](connection-parameters.html#supported-options-parameters).
