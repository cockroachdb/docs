To shut down the CockroachDB cluster:

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="operator">
{% capture latest_operator_version %}{% include_cached latest_operator_version.md %}{% endcapture %}

1. Delete the previously created custom resource:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl delete -f example.yaml
    ~~~

1. Remove the Operator:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator/v{{ latest_operator_version }}/install/operator.yaml
    ~~~

    This will delete the CockroachDB cluster being run by the Operator. It will *not* delete the persistent volumes that were attached to the pods. 

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
    If you want to delete the persistent volumes and free up the storage used by CockroachDB, be sure you have a backup copy of your data. Data **cannot** be recovered once the persistent volumes are deleted. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/delete-stateful-set/#persistent-volumes).
