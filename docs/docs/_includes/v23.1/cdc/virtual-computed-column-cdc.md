As of v22.1, changefeeds filter out [`VIRTUAL` computed columns](computed-columns.html) from events by default. This is a [backward-incompatible change](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-0-backward-incompatible-changes). To maintain the changefeed behavior in previous versions where [`NULL`](null-handling.html) values are emitted for virtual computed columns, see the [`virtual_columns`](create-changefeed.html#virtual-columns) option for more detail.
