## Before you begin

If you have not already installed the official CockroachDB Docker image, go to [Install CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html) and follow the instructions under **Use Docker**.

## Step 1. Create a bridge network

Since you'll be running multiple Docker containers on a single host, with one CockroachDB node per container, you need to create what Docker refers to as a [bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/#/a-bridge-network). The bridge network will enable the containers to communicate as a single cluster while keeping them isolated from external networks.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ docker network create -d bridge roachnet
~~~

We've used `roachnet` as the network name here and in subsequent steps, but feel free to give your network any name you like.

## Step 2. Start the first node

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ docker run -d \
--name=roach1 \
--hostname=roach1 \
--net=roachnet \
-p 26257:26257 -p 8080:8080  \
-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach1:/cockroach/cockroach-data"  \
{{page.release_info.docker_image}}:{{page.release_info.version}} start --insecure
~~~

This command creates a container and starts the first CockroachDB node inside it. Let's look at each part:

- `docker run`: The Docker command to start a new container.
- `-d`: This flag runs the container in the background so you can continue the next steps in the same shell.
- `--name`: The name for the container. This is optional, but a custom name makes it significantly easier to reference the container in other commands, for example, when opening a Bash session in the container or stopping the container.
- `--hostname`: The hostname for the container. You will use this to join other containers/nodes to the cluster.
- `--net`: The bridge network for the container to join. See step 1 for more details.
- `-p 26257:26257 -p 8080:8080`: These flags map the default port for inter-node and client-node communication (`26257`) and the default port for HTTP requests to the Admin UI (`8080`) from the container to the host. This enables inter-container communication and makes it possible to call up the Admin UI from a browser.
- `-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach1:/cockroach/cockroach-data"`: This flag mounts a host directory as a data volume. This means that data and logs for this node will be stored in `${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach1` on the host and will persist after the container is stopped or deleted. For more details, see Docker's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/">Bind Mounts</a> topic.
- `{{page.release_info.docker_image}}:{{page.release_info.version}} start --insecure`: The CockroachDB command to [start a node](start-a-node.html) in the container in insecure mode.

## Step 3. Add nodes to the cluster

At this point, your cluster is live and operational. With just one node, you can already connect a SQL client and start building out your database. In real deployments, however, you'll always want 3 or more nodes to take advantage of CockroachDB's [automatic replication](demo-data-replication.html), [rebalancing](demo-automatic-rebalancing.html), and [fault tolerance](demo-fault-tolerance-and-recovery.html) capabilities.

To simulate a real deployment, scale your cluster by adding two more nodes:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ docker run -d \
--name=roach2 \
--hostname=roach2 \
--net=roachnet \
-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach2:/cockroach/cockroach-data" \
{{page.release_info.docker_image}}:{{page.release_info.version}} start --insecure --join=roach1
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ docker run -d \
--name=roach3 \
--hostname=roach3 \
--net=roachnet \
-v "${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach3:/cockroach/cockroach-data" \
{{page.release_info.docker_image}}:{{page.release_info.version}} start --insecure --join=roach1
~~~

These commands add two more containers and start CockroachDB nodes inside them, joining them to the first node. There are only a few differences to note from step 2:

- `-v`: This flag mounts a host directory as a data volume. Data and logs for these nodes will be stored in `${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach2` and `${PWD}/cockroach-data/roach3` on the host and will persist after the containers are stopped or deleted.
- `--join`: This flag joins the new nodes to the cluster, using the first container's `hostname`. Otherwise, all [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) defaults are accepted. Note that since each node is in a unique container, using identical default ports wonâ€™t cause conflicts.

## Step 4. Test the cluster

Now that you've scaled to 3 nodes, you can use any node as a SQL gateway to the cluster. To demonstrate this, use the `docker exec` command to start the [built-in SQL shell](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) in the first container:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ docker exec -it roach1 ./cockroach sql --insecure
~~~

~~~
# Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit: CTRL + D.
~~~

Run some basic [CockroachDB SQL statements](learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE DATABASE bank;
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE bank.accounts (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance DECIMAL);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> INSERT INTO bank.accounts VALUES (1, 1000.50);
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |  1000.5 |
+----+---------+
(1 row)
~~~

Exit the SQL shell on node 1:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~

Then start the SQL shell in the second container:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ docker exec -it roach2 ./cockroach sql --insecure
~~~

~~~
# Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
# All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
# To exit: CTRL + D.
~~~

Now run the same `SELECT` query:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |  1000.5 |
+----+---------+
(1 row)
~~~

As you can see, node 1 and node 2 behaved identically as SQL gateways.

When you're done, exit the SQL shell on node 2:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~
