<h3 id="v20-2-15-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- The `kafka_sink_config` [changefeed option](../v20.2/create-changefeed.html) can now include `RequiredAcks`. [#69016][#69016]

<h3 id="v20-2-15-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed tooltip behavior on the [Sessions](../v20.2/ui-sessions-page.html), [Statements](../v20.2/ui-statements-page.html), and [Transactions](../v20.2/ui-transactions-page.html) pages. [#68477][#68477]

<h3 id="v20-2-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect query results when querying tables with multiple column families and unique secondary indexes. The bug only occurred if 1) [vectorized execution](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) was enabled for the query, 2) the query scanned a [unique secondary index](../v20.2/indexes.html) that contained columns from more than one column family, and 3) the rows fetched by the query contained `NULL` values for some of the indexed columns. This bug was present since version v20.1. [#68238][#68238]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate [`LIKE` expressions](../v20.2/scalar-expressions.html#string-pattern-matching) when the pattern contained the escape characters `\` if the expressions were executed via the [vectorized execution](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html). [#68354][#68354]
