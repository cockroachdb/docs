<h3 id="v21-2-0-rc-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly read the data of a unique secondary index that used to be a primary index created by an [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v21.2/alter-primary-key.html) command in v21.1.x or prior versions. This is now fixed. [#71586][#71586]
- Previously, CockroachDB could crash if network connectivity was impaired. The stack trace (in `cockroach-stderr.log`) would contain `server.(*statusServer).NodesUI` in that case. This is now fixed. [#71756][#71756]
- A bug has been fixed which caused incorrect results for some queries that utilized a zig-zag join. The bug could only reproduce on tables with at least two multi-column indexes with nullable columns. The bug was present since v19.2.0. [#71824][#71824]
- Fixed a rare deadlock on system ranges that could happen when an internal transaction [`COMMIT`](../v21.2/commit-transaction.html)/[`ROLLBACK`](../v21.2/rollback-transaction.html) that was a no-op (did not make any writes) triggered gossip data propagation. [#71978][#71978]
- Previously, some instances of a broken client connection could cause an infinite loop while processing commands from the client. This is now fixed. [#72004][#72004]
