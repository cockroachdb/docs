<h3 id="v21-2-17-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare internal error that could occur during planning when a query predicate included values close to the maximum or minimum `int64` value. The error, `estimated row count must be non-zero`, has now been fixed. [#88955][#88955]
- Fixed a longstanding bug that could cause the optimizer to produce an incorrect plan when aggregate functions `st_makeline` or `st_extent` were called with invalid-type and empty inputs respectively. [#88954][#88954]
- Fixed a bug that caused high SQL tail latencies during background rebalancing in the cluster. [#88738][#88738]
- Fixed a bug where draining or drained nodes could re-acquire leases during an import or an index backfill. [#88725][#88725]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect evaluation of expressions in the form `col +/- const1 ? const2`, where `const1` and `const2` are constant values and `?` is any comparison operator. The bug was caused by operator overflow when the optimizer attempted to simplify these expressions to have a single constant value. [#88971][#88971]
- Fixed a bug that has existed since v2.1.0 where queries containing a subquery with `EXCEPT` could produce incorrect results. This could happen if the optimizer could guarantee that the left side of the `EXCEPT` always returned more rows than the right side. In this case, the optimizer made a faulty assumption that the `EXCEPT` subquery always returned at least one row, which could cause the optimizer to perform an invalid transformation, possibly causing the full query to return incorrect results. [#89132][#89132]
- CockroachDB will now flush the write-ahead log on consistency checker failures when writing storage checkpoints. [#89401][#89401]
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect results from the floor division operator, `//`, when the numerator is non-constant and the denominator is the constant `1`. [#89264][#89264]
- Fixed a source of internal connectivity problems that would resolve after restarting the affected node. [#89618][#89618]
- Fixed errors that may occur in automatic statistics collection when the cluster setting `sql.stats.automatic_collection.min_stale_rows` is set to `0`. [#89706][#89706]
- Fixed a bug that caused spurious failures when running a restore. [#89019][#89019]
