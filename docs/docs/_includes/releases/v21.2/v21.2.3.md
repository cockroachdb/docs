## v21.2.3

Release Date: December 14, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-2-3-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a limitation of [`IMPORT`](../v21.2/import.html) for tables using user-defined types whereby any change to the set of tables or views which reference the type or any changes to privileges on the type during the `IMPORT` would lead to failure. Now, new references to the type or [`GRANT`](../v21.2/grant.html) or [`REVOKE`](../v21.2/revoke.html) operations performed while the `IMPORT` is ongoing will not cause failure. [#71500][#71500]
- Fixed a bug where [`RESTORE`](../v21.2/restore.html) could sometimes map OIDs to invalid types in certain circumstances containing user-defined types. [#73119][#73119]

<h3 id="v21-2-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The experimental [`ALTER COLUMN TYPE`](../v21.2/alter-column.html#altering-column-data-types) statement is no longer permitted when the column is stored in a [secondary index](../v21.2/schema-design-indexes.html). Prior to this change, that was the only sort of secondary index membership which was allowed, but the result of the operation was a subtly corrupted table. [#72797][#72797]
- Statements containing multiple [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](../v21.2/update-data.html#use-insert-on-conflict), [`UPSERT`](../v21.2/upsert.html), [`UPDATE`](../v21.2/update.html), or [`DELETE`](../v21.2/delete.html) subqueries can cause data corruption if they modify the same row multiple times. For example, the following `SELECT 1 `statement will cause corruption of table `t`:

    ~~~ sql
    CREATE TABLE t (i INT, j INT, PRIMARY KEY (i), INDEX (j)); INSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 0); WITH   cte1 AS (UPDATE t SET j = 1 WHERE i = 0 RETURNING *),   cte2 AS (UPDATE t SET j = 2 WHERE i = 0 RETURNING *) SELECT 1;
    ~~~

    Until this is fixed, this change disallows statements with multiple subqueries that modify the same table. Applications can work around this by rewriting problematic statements. For example, the query above can be rewritten as an explicit multi-statement transaction:

    ~~~ sql
    BEGIN; UPDATE t SET j = 1 WHERE i = 0; UPDATE t SET j = 2 WHERE i = 0; SELECT 1; COMMIT;
    ~~~

    Or, if it doesn't matter which update "wins", it can be written as multiple non-mutating CTEs on an `UPDATE` statement:

    ~~~ sql
    WITH   cte1 AS (SELECT 1),   cte2 AS (SELECT 2) UPDATE t SET j = x.j FROM (SELECT * FROM cte1 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM cte2) AS x (j) WHERE i = 0 RETURNING 1;
    ~~~

    Which in this case could be written more simply as:

    ~~~ sql
    UPDATE t SET j = x.j FROM (VALUES (1), (2)) AS x (j) WHERE i = 0 RETURNING 1;
    ~~~

    Note that in these last two rewrites the first update will win, rather than the last. None of these rewrites suffer from the corruption problem. To override this change and allow these statements in spite of the risk of corruption, applications can:

    ~~~sql
    SET CLUSTER SETTING sql.multiple_modifications_of_table.enabled = true
    ~~~

    However, with the `sql.multiple_modifications_of_table.enabled` [cluster setting](../v21.2/cluster-settings.html) enabled, there is nothing to prevent this type of corruption from occurring if the same row is modified multiple times by a single statement. To check for corruption, use the `EXPERIMENTAL SCRUB` command:

    ~~~ sql
    EXPERIMENTAL SCRUB TABLE t WITH OPTIONS INDEX ALL;
    ~~~

    [#71595][#71595]

- [`RESTORE TABLE`](../v21.2/restore.html) for a regional by row table into a multiregion database with the same regions as the backed up database is now allowed. The user must ensure that the regions in the backed up database and the database being restored into match, and are added in the same order, for the [`RESTORE`](../v21.2/restore.html) to work. [#72088][#72088]
- The structured payloads used for telemetry logs now include two new fields: `CostEstimate` and `Distribution`. `CostEstimate` is the cost of the query as estimated by the [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html), and `Distribution` is the distribution of the DistSQL query plan (local, full, or partial). [#73410][#73410]
- Fixed a bug which allowed [computed columns](../v21.2/computed-columns.html) to also have [`DEFAULT`](../v21.2/default-value.html) expressions. [#73190][#73190]

<h3 id="v21-2-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- When requesting the `pprofui` endpoints from the [**Advanced Debug** page](../v21.2/ui-debug-pages.html) in DB Console, operators can now query by node ID in order to request `pprofui` data from any node in the cluster without having to connect to its DB Console directly. Profiling UI links are in a separate section along with a `nodeID` selector to allow for easy targeting. [#71103][#71103]
- The absolute links on the [**Advanced Debug** page](../v21.2/ui-debug-pages.html) in DB Console have been updated to relative links. This will enable these links to work with the superuser dashboard in [Cloud Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud). [#73067][#73067]
- When an error is encountered in the [**Statements**](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html), [**Transactions**](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html), or [**Sessions**](../v21.2/ui-sessions-page.html) page, the user can now click on a reload button to reload the page. [#73115][#73115]

<h3 id="v21-2-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [`GENERATED ... IDENTITY`](../v21.2/create-table.html#identity-columns) would panic when using a non-`INT` value during table creation. [#73029][#73029]
- Fixed a bug whereby setting the `CACHE` for a sequence to `1` was ignored. Before this change [`ALTER SEQUENCE ... CACHE 1`](../v21.2/alter-sequence.html) would succeed but would not modify the cache value. [#71449][#71449]
- Fixed a bug where a crash during [startup](../v21.2/cockroach-start.html) may cause all subsequent starts to fail. [#73124][#73124]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur during planning for some [set operations](../v21.2/selection-queries.html#set-operations) (i.e., `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT`) when at least one side of the set operation was ordered on a column that was not output by the set operation. This bug was first introduced in v21.2.0 and does not exist in prior versions. [#73147][#73147]
- Manually enqueueing ranges via the [DB Console](../v21.2/ui-overview.html) will no longer crash nodes that contain an uninitialized replica for the enqueued range. [#73039][#73039]
- Fixed a crash with message "attempting to propose command writing below closed timestamp" that could occur, typically on overloaded systems experiencing non-cooperative lease transfers. [#73165][#73165]
- Fixed two bugs in the logic that optimized the number of spans to [backup](../v21.2/backup.html). [#73176][#73176]
- [**Transactions**](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html) now using the correct selector for sort setting and filters. [#73291][#73291]
- The GC queue now respects the `kv.queue.process.guaranteed_time_budget` [cluster setting](../v21.2/cluster-settings.html). [#70126][#70126]
- The `cockroach debug unsafe-remove-dead-replicas` tool was improved to handle the existence of learners. It will now produce the desired results in more circumstances. The tool remains dangerous and can irrevocably corrupt a cluster. [#70756][#70756]
- Fixed a rare internal error ("estimated row count must be non-zero"), which could occur when planning queries using a [GIN index](../v21.2/inverted-indexes.html). This error could occur if the histogram on the GIN index showed that there were no rows. [#73354][#73354]
- Fixed a bug where [`SHOW CREATE SCHEDULES`](../v21.2/show-create-schedule.html) was not redacting sensitive fields before displaying the [`CREATE SCHEDULE`](../v21.2/create-schedule-for-backup.html) query. [#71362][#71362]
- The `txnwaitqueue.pusher.waiting` metric no longer over-reports the number of pushing transactions in some cases. [#71744][#71744]
- Fixed a rare condition that could cause a range merge to get stuck waiting on itself. The symptom of this deadlock was a goroutine stuck in `handleMergeInProgressError` for tens of minutes. [#72050][#72050]
- [`RESTORE ... FROM LATEST IN`](../v21.2/restore.html) now works to restore the latest backup from a collection without needing to first inspect the collection to supply its actual path. [#73454][#73454]
- Prevent a panic in the parser when trying to parse the `.@n` tuple field deference syntax in the (invalid) n=0 case. [#73545][#73545]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB did not exit with the correct exit code when it ran out of disk space while the node was running. This behavior was new in v21.2 and was not behaving as intended. [#70853][#70853]
- Fixed certain bugs where [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v21.2/create-table-as.html) or `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` may panic if the [`SELECT` query](../v21.2/selection-queries.html) is an internal table requiring internal database state. [#73593][#73593]

<h3 id="v21-2-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The performance of transaction deadlock detection is now more stable even with significant [transaction contention](../v21.2/transactions.html#transaction-contention). [#71744][#71744]
- [Follower reads](../v21.2/follower-reads.html) that encounter many abandoned intents are now able to efficiently resolve those intents. This resolves an asymmetry where follower reads were previously less efficient at resolving abandoned intents than regular reads evaluated on a leaseholder. [#71884][#71884]
