<h3 id="v22-2-0-rc-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug which caused a migration in v22.1 to fail to drop an index on `system.statement_diagnostics_requests`. This caused upgrades from v22.1 to v22.2 to fail to create a new index with the same name as the index that was supposed to have been dropped. [#91309][#91309]
- A nil pointer crash that could be experienced when interleaving [`SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`](../v22.2/select-for-update.html) statements has been resolved. [#91257][#91257]
- Fixed a bug present only in earlier v22.2 release candidates, in which an [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY USING COLUMNS (x, x)`](../v22.2/alter-table.html#alter-primary-key) statement would result in an internal error instead of the expected user-facing error with a pgcode. [#91482][#91482]
- Previously, certain aggregate histograms would appear in `_status/vars` but not be available for graphing in the DB Console. These are now available. They include [changefeed](../v22.2/change-data-capture-overview.html)-related histograms and [row-level-TTL](../v22.2/row-level-ttl.html) histograms. [#91410][#91410]
