Release Date: November 1, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-5-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Changefeed [Kafka sinks](../v22.2/changefeed-sinks.html#kafka) no longer automatically retries when emitting a message batch that gets rejected by the server. This is a temporary rollback of the functionality. [#90037][#90037]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Star expressions, e.g., `SELECT * FROM ...` are no longer allowed in statements in user-defined functions (UDFs). These were allowed in `v22.2.0-beta.1` to `v22.2.0-beta.4`, but have been disallowed because they do not behave correctly. Issue [#90080](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/90080) tracks re-enabling star expressions in UDFs. [#90171][#90171]
- The `sql.defaults.experimental_auto_rehoming.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) is now marked as hidden. Also, the `experimental_enable_auto_rehoming` [session variable](../v22.2/set-vars.html) has been renamed to `enable_auto_rehoming`; the alias `experimental_enable_auto_rehoming` has been created for the renamed session variable. [#90185][#90185]
- Added a new `cloudstorage.azure.concurrent_upload_buffers` [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) to configure the number of concurrent buffers used when uploading files to Azure. [#90539][#90539]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-5-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The following TTL metrics have been renamed:
  - `jobs.row_level_ttl.range_total_duration` -> `jobs.row_level_ttl.span_total_duration`
  - `jobs.row_level_ttl.num_active_ranges` -> `jobs.row_level_ttl.num_active_spans` [#90381][#90381]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors in rare cases when running CTEs (statements with WITH clauses). This bug is only present in `v22.2.0-beta.2`, `v22.2.0-beta.3`, `v21.2.16`, and `v22.1.9`. [#89856][#89856]
- CockroachDB will no longer silently truncate trailing characters when attempting to convert corrupt JSON string input into JSONB. [#89927][#89927]
- Fixed a bug where [zone configs](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html) generated for a database with a secondary region were invalid, as the `voter_constraints` and the lease preferences called for voters and leaseholders to exist in both the primary and secondary region, which is impossible. This bug has been present since `v22.2.0-alpha.1`. [#90186][#90186]
- [Changefeeds](../v22.2/change-data-capture-overview.html) configured with `initial_scan_only` now ensure that all messages have successfully flushed to the sink prior to completion instead of potentially missing messages. [#90278][#90278]
- Fixed a bug where restoring a backup with a table containing `UniqueWithoutIndexConstraints` would fail because of incorrect `tableID` values being referenced in the constraints stored on the restored table. [#90052][#90052]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results for queries with string similar filters (e.g., `col % 'abc'`) on tables with trigram indexes. This bug is only present in 22.2 pre-release versions up to and including `v22.2.0-beta.3`. [#90164][#90164]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect evaluation of comparison expressions involving time and interval types, e.g., `col::TIME + '10 hrs'::INTERVAL' > '01:00'::TIME`. [#90367][#90367]
- Fixed a bug where a `REASSIGN OWNED BY`statement could experience errors if any descriptor owned by the user is currently being dropped. [#90389][#90389]
- Fixed a bug introduced in CockroachDB v22.1.9 that caused nodes to refuse to run jobs under rare circumstances. [#90464][#90464]
- Fixed the bug described in [#90475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/90475) and [#90474](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/90474) where a restoring cluster's codec was accidentally used to reason about spans in the backup manifest during restore planning. [#90528][#90528]
- Fixed a bug where specific input to `crdb_internal.trim_tenant_prefix` would cause a node crash. [#90542][#90542]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-5-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Added ARM64 binaries for macOS systems with [Apple Silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814). [#89944][#89944]
- Docker images for CockroachDB are now multi-architecture manifests, supporting both the `x86_64` (`amd64`) and `arm64` architectures. [#90304][#90304]
