 Feature                                                       | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------+----------------
[User-defined functions (UDFs)](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) | Migrate existing workloads that use user-defined functions (UDFs) to CockroachDB without the need to change them. CockroachDB supports invoking UDFs in `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses of [DML statements](../v22.2/sql-statements.html#data-manipulation-statements).
[Schema Conversion Tool](../cockroachcloud/migrations-page.html) | Use the Schema Conversion Tool on the CockroachDB Cloud Console to analyze your schema for SQL incompatibilities. The tool will identify and help you resolve errors in your schema, and then create a new CockroachDB database with the converted schema.
[Row-level time to live (TTL)](../v22.2/row-level-ttl.html)    | Row-level TTL is now generally available (GA). The GA release of row-level TTL support builds upon the existing ability to configure the lifespan of data by extending its configurability down to the row level. This release also improves TTL performance, and adds additional syntax to make calculating TTL expiration easier.
[Trigram indexes](../v22.2/trigram-indexes.html)               | Perform text search directly within CockroachDB with trigram indexes. Trigram indexes enable "fuzzy"  search (i.e., match a search term closely instead of exactly) within CockroachDB without the need to change your queries or set up complex full text search systems.
[Invisible indexes](../v22.2/alter-index.html#not-visible) | Create and test indexes without affecting your overall application.
[Insights page](../v22.2/ui-insights-page.html)                 | View problems that CockroachDB has detected in your workloads and schemas on the Insights page. The page helps identify SQL statements with [high retry counts](../v22.2/transactions.html#automatic-retries), [slow execution](../v22.2/query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#identify-slow-queries), or [suboptimal plans](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html). It also helps identify [indexes](../v22.2/indexes.html) that should be created, altered, replaced, or dropped to improve performance.

<h4 id="v22-2-0-recovery-and-io">Recovery and I/O</h4>

 Feature                                                          | Description
------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------
[Change data capture (CDC) transformations](../v22.2/cdc-transformations.html) </br>(Preview, [{{ site.data.products.enterprise }}-only](../v22.2/enterprise-licensing.html))| Simplify your event-based applications and data pipelines by extracting only the data you need from CockroachDB. Use standard SQL expressions to specify up-front transformations to the data you want to stream to the rest of your system.
[CDC performance improvements](../v22.2/advanced-changefeed-configuration.html) </br>([{{ site.data.products.enterprise }}-only](../v22.2/enterprise-licensing.html)) | Get up to 9x faster changefeed performance for certain workloads or deployments with large storage volumes (in the order of terabytes).
[Backup validation](../v22.2/backup-validation.html) | Use backup validation tools to check that backups you have in storage are restorable.

<h4 id="v22-2-0-database-operations">Database operations</h4>

 Feature                                                        | Description
----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------
[Secondary regions](../v22.2/multiregion-overview.html#secondary-regions) | Use secondary regions to specify which region the leaseholders move to in the event of a failure. Secondary regions let you improve latency during failures, plan better for outages, and routinely test failover scenarios without impacting performance.
[PostgREST support](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/tutorials/tut0.html) | Perform basic CRUD operations in CockroachDB using a REST API with new support for the open source tool PostgREST. Docs coming soon.
[Hasura integration](../v22.2/hasura-getting-started.html)                                              | Build APIs, secure access, deploy and scale the app server, and optimize performance with the CockroachDB integration with Hasura. Hasura acts as a middleware for translating GraphQL queries into SQL and provides an easy way to offer GraphQL functionality, so you do not have to write application logic for these capabilities. In addition to GraphQL, Hasura also provides an easy way to build REST APIs on top of CockroachDB.

<h4 id="v22-2-0-security">Security</h4>

 Feature                                             | Description
-----------------------------------------------------+-------------
[Private {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters](../cockroachcloud/private-clusters.html) | Secure your {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters with private IPs to protect your data from potential threats. Updates to give your cluster end-to-end protection include the ability to secure clusters with only node-level private IPs, to access public external resources using a NAT Gateway, and to access cloud storage over your provider’s private connectivity.
[Egress perimeter controls on {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters](../cockroachcloud/egress-perimeter-controls.html) </br>(Preview)| Use egress perimeter controls to reduce risk by configuring allowed external destinations for data. This new feature lets admins specify where users are allowed to send backups, data exports, changefeeds, etc. The virtual firewall capability significantly reduces the risk of data exfiltration and lets you restrict a cluster’s access to only organizationally allowed resources.
[Cloud cluster Single-Sign On (SSO)](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-sso.html) </br>(Preview) | Use cluster SSO to allow application-level SQL identities to use JSON web tokens (JWT) to authenticate on {{ site.data.products.db }} clusters. SSO also lets SQL users access their cluster using the same SSO provider that you’ve already set up for the {{ site.data.products.db }} Console.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for [backup](../v22.2/backup.html#required-privileges), [restore](../v22.2/restore.html#required-privileges), and [observability](../v22.2/ui-overview.html#role-based-security) | Combine or inherit task-specific permissions into SQL roles for backup, restore, and observability. Roles can be assigned to relevant SQL users to simplify management of access control and prevent escalation of privilege.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for [CDC](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html#required-privileges) ([{{ site.data.products.enterprise }}-only](../v22.2/enterprise-licensing.html))| Combine or inherit task-specific permissions into SQL roles for CDC. Roles can be assigned to relevant SQL users to simplify management of access control and prevent escalation of privilege.
[Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for bulk operations](../v22.2/cloud-storage-authentication.html) | Create secure IAM roles in your cloud provider to access your cloud resources, so developers and operators can configure backups, restores, import, export, and CDC without requiring direct access to those resources or to relevant credentials.
[Cloud organization audit logs](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-audit-logs.html) | Export information on your team’s actions in your Cloud organization (e.g., managing users and their access, creating and deleting clusters, and configuring IP allowlisting). Access these logs as needed, or create simple pull-based clients to incrementally send those to your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.
[SCRAM password authentication method](../v22.2/security-reference/scram-authentication.html) | Avoid CPU bottlenecks during password authentication, and avoid sending passwords to CockroachDB in cleartext. This feature was first introduced in v22.1, and is now enabled by default.

<h4 id="v22-2-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v22.2](../v22.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes and adjust your deployment as necessary.

{% include v22.2/backward-incompatible/alpha.1.md %}

<h4 id="v22-2-0-deprecations">Deprecations</h4>

- The `--redact-logs` flag to [`cockroach debug zip`](../v22.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html) has been deprecated in favor of the `--redact` flag, which applies to a broader scope than just logs, and also includes logs. The new `--redact` flag triggers the redaction of all sensitive data in debug zip bundles, with the exception of range keys. Range keys must remain unredacted because they are essential to support CockroachDB. The `--redact-logs` flag is still available but displays a redaction warning and is interpreted as `--redact` instead. [#88266][#88266]
- Previously, [`BACKUP`](../v22.2/backup.html) allowed the user to specify a custom subdirectory name for their backups via `BACKUP .. INTO {subdir} IN {collectionURI}`. This is no longer supported. Users can only create a full backup via `BACKUP ... INTO {collectionURI}` or an incremental backup on the latest full backup in their collection via `BACKUP ... INTO LATEST IN {collectionURI}`. This deprecation also removes the need to address a bug in `SHOW BACKUPS IN`, which cannot display user-defined subdirectories. [#79447][#79447]
- The `debug unsafe-remove-dead-replicas` CLI command has been deprecated, and will be removed in v23.1. Users should use the new `debug recover` set of commands instead. [#88765][#88765]
