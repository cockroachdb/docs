Release Date: April 19, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Removed experimental feature `UNIQUE WITHOUT INDEX` from the documentation. [#63499][#63499] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [`pg_get_partkeydef` built-in function](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html) is now implemented by always returning `NULL`. [#63149][#63149] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now collects execution stats for all statements when seen for the first time. To disable this behavior, set the [`sql.txn_stats.sample_rate` cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) to 0, which will disable all execution stats collection. [#63325][#63325] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB will now block the ability to set the initial `PRIMARY REGION` of a database if any [multi-region](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) fields on any zone configs in the database have been set. [#63354][#63354] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now introduces a `pgcode` when attempting to [`DROP REGION`](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) when the region being dropped is the `PRIMARY REGION`. [#63354][#63354] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Replaced the word "tuple" with its more user-friendly synonym "row" in [vectorized stats outputs](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html). [#62956][#62956] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Changed [`BACKUP`](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) of [interleaved tables](../v21.1/interleave-in-parent.html) to require the `include_deprecated_interleaves` option as interleaved table backups will not be able to be restored in future versions of CockroachDB. [#63501][#63501] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- `RESTORE` now cannot [restore](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) `BACKUP`s made by newer versions of CockroachDB. [#62398][#62398] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

The following statements now render correctly as events in the [DB Console](../v21.1/ui-overview.html) [#63141][#63141]:
- [`ALTER DATABASE ADD REGION`](../v21.1/add-region.html)
- [`ALTER DATABASE SET PRIMARY REGION`](../v21.1/set-locality.html)
- [`ALTER DATABASE ... SURVIVE ... FAILURE`](../v21.1/survive-failure.html)
- [`ALTER DATABASE DROP REGION`](../v21.1/)
- [`CREATE TYPE`](../v21.1/create-type.html)
- [`ALTER TYPE`](../v21.1/alter-type.html)
- [`DROP TYPE`](../v21.1/drop-type.html)

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug present in earlier 21.1 versions where [`BACKUP`s](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) would produce an error when they should be able to backup the underlying data. [#63095][#63095]
- [Dropping a foreign key](../v21.1/drop-constraint.html) that was added in the same transaction no longer triggers an internal error. This bug has been present since at least version 20.1. [#62879][#62879]
- Fixed a bug where an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... UNIQUE` statement would cause an error if the table had a [`PARTITION ALL BY` or `REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) definition. [#63189][#63189]
- Fixed a bug in earlier 21.1 versions where `CREATE TABLE LIKE` would copy a [`VIRTUAL` column](../v21.1/computed-columns.html) from the source table as a `STORED` column in the destination table. [#63172][#63172]
- CockroachDB now returns an error when trying to perform a [backup](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) of a cluster that was taken on another tenant. [#63223][#63223]
- Fixed a bug where index backfill data may have been missed by [`BACKUP`](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) in incremental backups. [#63221][#63221]
- Fixed a bug where [`REGIONAL BY ROW` zone configs](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) were dropped before `REGIONAL BY ROW` changes are finalized. This caused a bug when the `REGIONAL BY ROW` transformation fail. [#63274][#63274]
- Fixed a case where implicitly partitioned columns (e.g., from [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) and hash-sharded indexes) previously showed as `implicit = false` when using `SHOW INDEXES` or querying `information_schema.pg_indexes`. [#63275][#63275]
- Fixed an error that could occur when performing an [`UPSERT`](../v21.1/upsert.html) on a [`REGIONAL BY ROW` table](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html) with no secondary indexes or foreign keys. The error, 'missing "crdb_region" primary key column', has now been fixed. [#63257][#63257]
- Fixed a bug where tables that were created by CockroachDB 19.x or older that included foreign key constraints and were [backed up](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) with the `revision_history` option would be malformed when restored by a CockroachDB 20.x cluster if the `RESTORE` used the `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` option. [#63267][#63267]
- Fixed a bug in [user-defined schemas](../v21.1/schema-design-schema.html) where the dropping of any schema would prevent creation of schemas with the name of the database and would corrupt existing schemas of that name. [#63395][#63395]
- Fixed a bug in previous CockroachDB 21.1 releases where CockroachDB would sometimes return the output in an incorrect order if a query containing hash-aggregation was executed via the [vectorized execution engine](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html) and spilled to temporary storage. [#63408][#63408]
- Fixed a bug where [incremental cluster backups](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) may have missed data written to tables while they were `OFFLINE`. In practice this could have occurred if a [`RESTORE`](../v21.1/restore.html) or [`IMPORT`](../v21.1/import.html) was running across incremental backups. [#63304][#63304]
- CockroachDB now includes more anonymized data from SQL statements in telemetry updates and crash reports. [#63482][#63482]
- Fixed a rare issue that caused replica divergence. If this occurred the divergence was reported by the [replica consistency checker](../v21.1/architecture/replication-layer.html), typically within 24 hours of occurrence, and caused the nodes to terminate. [#63473][#63473]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved performance of reverting [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.1/import-into.html) jobs that `IMPORT INTO` empty tables. [#63220][#63220]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-4-miscellaneous-improvements">Miscellaneous improvements</h3>

- Made the Kafka library used in [changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) configurable using the `kafka_sink_config` option to enable latency versus throughput configurations. [#63361][#63361]
- Connected the [changefeed](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) memory monitor to the parent SQL monitor to ensure that changefeeds do not try to use more memory than is available to the SQL server. [#63409][#63409]
