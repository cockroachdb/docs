## v21.1.8

Release Date: August 30, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release advisory_key="a69874" %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The [node status retrieval endpoints over HTTP](../v21.1/monitoring-and-alerting.html) (`/_status/nodes`, `/_status/nodes/<N>`, and the DB Console `/#/reports/nodes`) have been updated to require the [`admin`](../v21.1/authorization.html#admin-role) role from the requesting user. This ensures that operational details such as network addresses and command-line flags do not leak to unprivileged users. [#67068][#67068] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- A recent release removed parts of some queries from the [debugging traces](../v21.1/show-trace.html) of those queries. This information (i.e. the execution of some low-level RPCs) has been re-included in the traces. [#68923][#68923] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- The `kafka_sink_config` [changefeed option](../v21.1/create-changefeed.html) can now include `RequiredAcks`. [#69015][#69015] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added a new per-node [changefeed](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) configuration [`changefeed.node_sink_throttle_config`](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) that can be used to throttle the rate of emission from the memory buffer thus making it possible to limit the emission rate from changefeeds. [#68628][#68628] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a new [`EXPLAIN` flag](../v21.1/explain.html), `MEMO`, to be used with [`EXPLAIN (OPT)`](../v21.1/explain.html#opt-option). When the `MEMO` flag is passed, a representation of the optimizer memo will be printed along with the best plan. The `MEMO` flag can be used in combination with other flags such as `CATALOG` and `VERBOSE`. For example, `EXPLAIN (OPT, MEMO, VERBOSE)` will print the memo along with verbose output for the best plan. [#67778][#67775] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Some queries with [lookup joins](../v21.1/joins.html#lookup-joins) and/or top K sorts are now more likely to be executed in a "local" manner with the [`distsql=auto`](../v21.1/set-vars.html#parameters) session variable when the newly introduced `sql.distsql.prefer_local_execution.enabled` [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) is set to `true` (`false` is the default). [#68613][#68613] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Introduced the `bulkio.index_backfill.checkpoint_interval` [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) to control the rate at which backfills checkpoint their progress. Useful for controlling the backfill rate on large tables. [#68287][#68287] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- [`cockroach debug zip`](../v21.1/cockroach-debug-zip.html) no longer retrieves database and table details into separate files. The schema information is collected by means of `system.descriptors` and `crdb_internal.create_statements`. [#68984][#68984] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added a new column picker on the [Statements](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html) and [Statements Details pages](../v21.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) to select which columns to display in the statements table. Includes a new database column option for database name information, which is hidden by default on the [Statements page](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html). [#68294][#68294] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed the [Transactions page](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html) to show the correct value for implicit transactions. [#68294][#68294]
- [Statements Details](../v21.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page), [Statements](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html), and [Transactions pages](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html) now display information about the node and region on which a statement was executed. [#68317][#68317] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed tooltips behavior on the [Sessions](../v21.2/ui-sessions-page.html), [Statements](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html), and [Transactions pages](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html). [#68474][#68474] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed missing [foreign key](../v21.1/foreign-key.html) checks in some cases when there are multiple checks and the inserted data contains a `NULL` for one of the checks. [#68520][#68520]
- Fixed a bug where using [`ST_segmentize`](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) on coordinates that are infinite would error with a crash. [#67848][#67848]
- Fixed the [`COPY CSV`](../v21.1/copy-from.html) command so that it handles multiple records separated by newline characters. [#68623][#68623] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect query results when querying tables with multiple [column families](../v21.1/column-families.html) and unique secondary [indexes](../v21.1/indexes.html). The bug only occurred if 1) [vectorized execution](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html) was enabled for the query, 2) the query scanned a [unique secondary index](../v21.1/indexes.html) that contained columns from more than one column family, and 3) the rows fetched by the query contained `NULL` values for some of the indexed columns. This bug was present since version v20.1. [#68238][#68239]
- Fixed a crash in the `/debug/closedts-{sender,receiver}` [advanced debug pages](../v21.1/ui-debug-pages.html) if the last message of the closed timestamp side transport buffer was removed before rendering. [#68669][#68669]
- Fixed an issue where terminating a CockroachDB process early in its startup routine might cause it to fail to start again, falsely reporting write-ahead log corruption. [#68897][#68897]
- Fixed a regression in the [optimizer's cost model](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) that could cause it to choose sub-optimal plans when choosing between two non-unique index scans with different numbers of columns per index. [#68991][#68991]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate [`LIKE` expressions](../v21.1/scalar-expressions.html#string-pattern-matching) when the pattern contained the escape characters `\` if the expressions were executed via the [vectorized execution engine](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html). [#68353][#68353]
- File logs now respect the [`max-group-size`](../v21.1/configure-logs.html) configuration parameter again. This parameter had incorrectly become ignored in v21.1, resulting in arbitrarily large log directories. [#69007][#69007]
- Fixed a bug in [`EXPORT`](../v21.1/export.html) where concurrent exports could overwrite each other. [#68392][#68392]

<h3 id="v21-1-8-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Jobs no longer hold exclusive locks during the duration of their checkpointing transactions which could result in long wait times when trying to run [`SHOW JOBS`](../v21.1/show-jobs.html). [#68244][#68244] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [Lookup joins](../v21.1/joins.html#lookup-joins) on indexes with virtual columns are now considered by the optimizer. This should result in more efficient queries in many cases. Most notably, post-query uniqueness checks for unique indexes on virtual columns in [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v21.1/regional-tables.html#regional-by-row-tables) can now use the unique index rather than perform a full-table scan.
