## v21.1.19

Release Date: May 9, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-19-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where backups in the base directory of a Google Storage bucket would not be discovered by [`SHOW BACKUPS`](../v21.1/show-backup.html). These backups will now appear correctly. [#80509][#80509]

<h3 id="v21-1-19-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Previously, a user could run an `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` [incremental backup](../v21.1//take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups) with an end time earlier than the previous backup's end time, which could lead to an out of order incremental backup chain. An incremental backup will now fail if the `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` is less than the previous backup's end time. [#80500][#80500]

<h3 id="v21-1-19-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added a dropdown filter on the Node Diagnostics page to view by active, decommissioned, or all nodes. [#80340][#80340]
- Added an alert banner on Overview list page for staggered node versions [#80748][#80748]

<h3 id="v21-1-19-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused an internal error when the inner expression of a column access expression evaluated to `NULL`. For example, evaluation of the expression `(CASE WHEN b THEN ((ROW(1) AS a)) ELSE NULL END).a` would error when `b` is `false`. This bug has been present since v19.1 or earlier. [#79527][#79527]
- Fixed a bug that caused an error when accessing a named column of a labelled tuple. The bug only occurred when an expression could produce one of several different tuples. For example, `(CASE WHEN true THEN (ROW(1) AS a) ELSE (ROW(2) AS a) END).a` would fail to evaluate. Although present in previous versions, it was impossible to encounter due to limitations that prevented using tuples in this way. [#79527][#79527]
- Addressed an issue where automatic encryption-at-rest data key rotation would get disabled after a node restart without a store key rotation. [#80171][#80171]
- The timeout when checking for Raft application of upgrade migrations has been increased from 5 seconds to 1 minute, and is now controllable via the [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) `kv.migration.migrate_application.timeout`. This makes migrations much less likely to fail in clusters with ongoing rebalancing activity during upgrade migrations. [#80754][#80754]
- Fixed a bug where, in rare circumstances, CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate queries with `ORDER BY` clause when the prefix of ordering was already provided by the index ordering of the scanned table. [#80732][#80732]
- Fixed a goroutine leak when internal rangefeed clients received certain kinds of retryable errors. [#80795][#80795]
