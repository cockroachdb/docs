<h3>Console changes</h3>

- You no longer need to download a CA certificate to [connect to a {{ site.data.products.serverless }}](../cockroachcloud/connect-to-a-serverless-cluster.html) cluster through the CockroachDB SQL client if your cluster is running [v21.2.5](v21.2.html) or later.
- When [creating a {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster](../cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.html), the approximate monthly cost is now displayed in the **Summary** sidebar along with the hourly cost.
