## v22.1.8

Release Date: September 29, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-8-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- For pgwire-level prepared statements, CockroachDB now supports the case where the number of the type hints is greater than the number of placeholders in a given query. [#88145][#88145]
- The index of a placeholder is now replaced to always be `$1` to limit fingerprint creations. [#88364][#88364]
- Changed the default value of `sql.metrics.statement_details.plan_collection.enabled` to `false`, as this information is no longer used. [#88420][#88420]

<h3 id="v22-1-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Reduced the length of the `raft.process.handleready.latency` metric help text to avoid it being rejected by certain Prometheus services. [#88147][#88147]

<h3 id="v22-1-8-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Changed the column name from `Users` to `User Name` on the **Databases** > **Tables** page, when viewing Grants. [#87857][#87857]
- Fixed the index and grant sorting on the **Databases** page to have a default column, and to update the URL to match the selected item. [#87862][#87862]
- Added "Application Name" to the **SQL Activity** > **Statements**, **Transaction Overview** (and their respective column selectors), and **Transaction Details** pages, and updated the label from "App" to "Application Name" on the **Statement Details** page. [#87874][#87874]
- On the **SQL Activity** "Session Details" page, the "Most Recent Statement" column now shows the last active query instead of "No Active Statement". [#88055][#88055]

<h3 id="v22-1-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, an active replication report update could prevent a node from shutting down until it completed. Now, the report update is cancelled on node shutdown instead. [#87924][#87924]
- Fixed a bug with [`LOOKUP`](../v22.2/joins.html#lookup-joins) join selectivity estimation when using [hash-sharded indexes](../v22.2/hash-sharded-indexes.html), which could cause `LOOKUP` joins to be selected by the optimizer in cases where other join methods are less expensive. [#87390][#87390]
- Fixed incorrect results from queries which utilize [locality](../v22.2/cockroach-start.html#locality)-optimized search on the inverted index of a table with `REGIONAL BY ROW` partitioning. [#88113][#88113]
- The `current_setting` [built-in function](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html) no longer results in an error when checking a custom [session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html) that does not exist when the `missing_ok` argument is set to `true`. [#88161][#88161]
- When a CockroachDB node is being [drained](../v22.2/node-shutdown.html#drain-a-node-manually), all queries that are still running on that node are now forcefully canceled after waiting for the specified `server.shutdown.query_wait` period if the newly-added cluster setting `sql.distsql.drain.cancel_after_wait.enabled` is set to `true` (it is `false` by default). [#88150][#88150]
- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly fail to fetch rows with `NULL` values when reading from the unique secondary index when multiple [column families](../v22.2/column-families.html) are defined for the table and the index doesn't store some of the `NOT NULL` columns. [#88209][#88209]
- CockroachDB now more promptly reacts to query cancellations (e.g., due to statement timeout being exceeded) after the query [spills to disk](../v22.2/vectorized-execution.html#disk-spilling-operations). [#88394][#88394]
- Fixed a bug existing since before v21.1 that could cause an internal error when executing a query with `LIMIT` ordering on the output of a [window function](../v22.2/window-functions.html). [#87746][#87746]
- CockroachDB no longer fetches unnecessary rows for queries with specified `LIMIT`s. The bug was introduced in v22.1.7. [#88421][#88421]
- Prometheus histograms were incorrectly omitting buckets whose cumulative count matched the preceding bucket. This would lead to erroneous results when operating on histogram sums. [#88331][#88331]
- Completed [statement diagnostics bundles](../v22.2/explain-analyze.html#debug-option) now persist in the DB Console, and can been seen on the **Statement Diagnostics History** page, under **Advanced Debug**. [#88390][#88390]
- Dropping temporary tables and sequences now properly checks a user's privileges. [#88360][#88360]
- The pgwire `DESCRIBE` step no longer fails with an error while attempting to look up cursors declared with names containing special characters. [#88413][#88413]
- Fixed a bug in [`BACKUP`](../v22.2/backup.html) where spans for views were being backed up. Because ranges are not split at view boundaries, this can cause the backup to send export requests to ranges that do not belong to any backup target. [#86681][#86681]
- Fixed a bug where if telemetry is enabled, [`COPY`](../v22.2/copy-from.html) could sometimes cause the server to crash. [#88325][#88325]
- Fixed a rare internal error that could occur during planning when a predicate included values close to the maximum or minimum `int64` value. The error, `estimated row count must be non-zero`, is now fixed. [#88533][#88533]
- Adjusted sending and receiving Raft queue sizes to match. Previously the receiver could unnecessarily drop messages in situations when the sending queue is bigger than the receiving one. [#88448][#88448]
