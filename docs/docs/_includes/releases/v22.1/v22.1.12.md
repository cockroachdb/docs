## v22.1.12

Release Date: December 12, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-12-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Bulk operations now log sanitized connection destinations, for example:

	 `backup planning to connect to destination gs://test/backupadhoc?AUTH=specified&CREDENTIALS=redacted` [#92207][#92207]

<h3 id="v22-1-12-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- [Kafka sinks](../v22.1/changefeed-sinks.html#kafka-sink-configuration) can now (optionally) be configured with a "Compression" field to the `kafka_sink_config` option. This field can be set to `none` (default), `GZIP`, `SNAPPY`, `LZ4`, or `ZSTD`. Setting this field will determine the compression protocol used when emitting events. [#91276][#91276]

<h3 id="v22-1-12-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Logs produced by setting an increased vmodule setting for s3_storage are now directed to the DEV channel rather than STDOUT. [#91960][#91960]

- Introduced a metric (`replicas.leaders_invalid_lease`) that indicates how many replicas are Raft group leaders but holding invalid leases. [#91194][#91194]

<h3 id="v22-1-12-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Changed the height of the column selector, so it can hint there are more options to be selected once scrolled. [#91910][#91910]
- Added fingerprint ID in hex format to the [Statement Details](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html) page and [Transaction Details](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html#transaction-details-page) page. [#91959][#91959]
- Updated the tooltip on `SQL Statement Errors` chart on Metrics page. [#92711][#92711]

<h3 id="v22-1-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in which panics triggered by certain DDL statements were not properly recovered, leading to the cluster node crashing. [#91555][#91555]
- Fixed a panic that could occur when calling `st_distancespheroid` or `st_distancesphere` with a spatial object containing an NaN coordinate. This now produces an error, `input is out of range`. [#91634][#91634]
- Fixed a bug that resulted in some retriable errors not being retried during `IMPORT`. [#90432][#90432]
- Fixed a bug in `Concat` projection operators for arrays that could cause non-null values to be added to the array when one of the arguments was null. [#91653][#91653]
- Previously, `SET DEFAULT NULL` resulted in a column whose DefaultExpr is NULL. This is problematic when used with `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` where a temporary computed column will be created, hence violating validation that "a computed column cannot have default expression". This is now fixed by setting `DefaultExpr` to `nil` when `SET DEFAULT NULL`. [#91089][#91089]
- Fixed a bug introduced in "v21.2" that could cause an internal error in rare cases when a query required a constrained index scan to return results in order. [#91692][#91692]
- Fixed a bug which, in rare cases, could result in a [changefeed](../v22.1/change-data-capture-overview.html) missing rows occurring around the time of a split in writing transactions that take longer than the closed timestamp target duration (defaults to 3s). [#91749][#91749]
- Added leading zeros to fingerprint IDs with less than 16 characters. [#91959][#91959]
- Fixed a bug introduced in "v20.2" that could in rare cases cause filters to be dropped from a query plan with many joins. [#91654][#91654]
- Fixed an unhandled error that could happen if [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](../v22.1/alter-default-privileges.html) was run on the system database. [#92083][#92083]
- Reduced the amount that `RESTORE` over-splits ranges. This is enabled by default. [#91141][#91141]
- Fixed a bug causing changefeeds to fail when a value is deleted while running on a non-primary [column family with multiple columns](../v22.1/changefeeds-on-tables-with-column-families.html). [#91953][#91953]
- Stripped quotation marks from database and table names to correctly query for index usage statistics. [#92282][#92282]
- Fixed the [statement activity](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprint-page) page so that it no longer shows multi-statement implicit transactions as "explicit." [#92430][#92430]
- Fixed a bug existing since "v20.2" that could cause incorrect results in rare cases for queries with inner joins and left joins. For the bug to occur, the left join had to be in the input of the inner join and the inner join filters had to reference both inputs of the left join, and not filter `NULL` values from the right input of the left join. Additionally, the right input of the left join had to contain at least one join, with one input not referenced by the left join's `ON` condition. [#92103][#92103]
- When configured to true, the `sql.metrics.statement_details.dump_to_logs` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) no longer causes a mutex deadlock. [#92278][#92278]
- Fixed incorrect cancellation logic when attempting to detect stuck rangefeeds. [#92702][#92702]
- Fixed an internal error when comparing a tuple type with a non-tuple type. [#92714][#92714]
- `attidentity` for `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` column should be `d`. [#92835][#92835]
- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate queries that performed left semi and left anti "virtual lookup" joins on tables in `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`. These join types can be planned when a subquery is used inside of a filter condition. The bug was introduced in v20.2.0 and is now fixed. [#92881][#92881]

<h3 id="v22-1-12-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- To protect against unexpected situations where garbage collection would trigger too frequently, the GC score cooldown period has been lowered. The GC score ratio is computed from MVCC stats and uses ratio of live objects and estimated garbage age to estimate collectability of old data. The reduced score will trigger GC earlier, lowering interval between runs 3 times, giving 2 times reduced peak garbage usage at the expense of 30% increase of wasteful data scanning on constantly updated data. [#92816][#92816]
- CockroachDB in some cases now correctly incorporates the value of the `OFFSET` clause when determining the number of rows that need to be read when the `LIMIT` clause is also present. Note that there was no correctness issue here - only that extra unnecessary rows could be read. [#92839][#92839]
- [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v22.1/show-backup.html) on a backup containing several table descriptors is now more performant. [#93143][#93143]
