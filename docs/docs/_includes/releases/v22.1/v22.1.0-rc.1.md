- Fixed a very rare case where CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate queries with an [`ORDER BY`](../v22.1/order-by.html) clause when the prefix of ordering was already provided by the index ordering of the scanned table. [#80715][#80715]

- Fixed a rare crash when encountering a nil-pointer deference in `google.golang.org/grpc/internal/transport.(*Stream).Context(...)`. [#80936][#80936]
