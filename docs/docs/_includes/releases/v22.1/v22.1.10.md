<h3 id="v22-1-10-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Added three [cluster settings](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) in [#89774][#89774] to collect trace data for outlier executions with low overhead. This is only available in [v22.1](../releases/v22.1.html); in [v22.2](../releases/v22.2.html) and later we have other mechanisms to collect outlier traces. Traces come in handy when looking to investigate latency spikes, and these settings are intended to supplant most uses of `sql.trace.stmt.enable_threshold`. That setting enables verbose tracing for all statements with 100% probability which can cause a lot of overhead in production clusters, and also a lot of logging pressure. Instead we introduce the following: 
    - `trace.fingerprint`
    - `trace.fingerprint.probability`
    - `trace.fingerprint.threshold`

    Put together (all have to be set) they only enable tracing for the statement with the set hex-encoded fingerprint, and do so probabilistically (where the probability is whatever `trace.fingerprint.probability` is set to), logging it only if the latency threshold is exceeded (configured using `trace.fingerprint.threshold`). To obtain a hex-encoded fingerprint, look at the contents of `system.statement_statistics`. For example:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    SELECT encode(fingerprint_id, 'hex'), (statistics -> 'statistics' ->> 'cnt')::INT AS count, metadata ->> 'query' AS query FROM system.statement_statistics ORDER BY COUNT DESC limit 10;
    ~~~

    ~~~
           encode    | count |                                             query

<h3 id="v22-1-10-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The [Statements page](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html), [Transactions page](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html), and [Transaction Details page](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html#transaction-details-page) in the [DB console](../v22.1/ui-overview.html) now properly show the **Regions** and **Nodes** columns and filters for [multi-region clusters](../v22.1/multiregion-overview.html). [#89818][#89818]
- Fixed a bug which caused [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`](../v22.1/alter-changefeed.html) to fail if the changefeed was created with a cursor option and had been running for more than [`gc.ttlseconds`](../v22.1/configure-replication-zones.html#gc-ttlseconds). [#89399][#89399]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors in rare cases when running [common table expressions](../v22.1/common-table-expressions.html) (a.k.a. CTEs, or statements with `WITH` clauses). This bug was only present in [v22.2.0-beta.2](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0-beta-2), [v22.2.0-beta.3](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0-beta-3), [v21.2.16](../releases/v21.2.html#v21-2-16), and [v22.1.9](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-9). [#89854][#89854]
- Fixed a bug where it was possible for [leases](../v22.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) to temporarily move outside of explicitly configured regions. This often happened during [load-based rebalancing](../v22.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#load-based-replica-rebalancing), something CockroachDB does continually across the cluster. Because of this, it was also possible to observe a continual rate of lease thrashing as leases moved out of configured zones, triggered rebalancing, and induced other leases to move out of the configured zone while the original set moved back, and so on. [#90013][#90013]
- Excluded [check constraints](../v22.1/check.html) of [hash-sharded indexes](../v22.1/hash-sharded-indexes.html) from being invalidated when executing [`IMPORT INTO`](../v22.1/import-into.html). [#89528][#89528]
- Fixed overlapping charts on the [Statement Details page](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page). [#90090][#90090]
- `initial_scan_only` [changefeeds](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html#initial-scan) now ensure that all messages have successfully flushed to the sink prior to completion, instead of potentially missing messages. [#90293][#90293]
- Fixed a bug introduced in [v22.1.9](../releases/v22.1.html#v22-1-9) that caused nodes to refuse to run [jobs](../v22.1/show-jobs.html) under rare circumstances. [#90265][#90265]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect evaluation of [comparison expressions](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#comparison-functions) involving [`TIME`](../v22.1/time.html) and [`INTERVAL`](../v22.1/interval.html) types, e.g., `col::TIME + '10 hrs'::INTERVAL' > '01:00'::TIME`. [#90370][#90370]
