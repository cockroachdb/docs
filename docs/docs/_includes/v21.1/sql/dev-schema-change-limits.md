Review the [limitations of online schema changes in CockroachDB](online-schema-changes.html#limitations). Note that CockroachDB has [limited support for schema changes within the same explicit transaction](online-schema-changes.html#limited-support-for-schema-changes-within-transactions).

    We recommend doing schema changes outside explicit transactions, where possible. When a database [schema management tool](third-party-database-tools.html#schema-migration-tools) manages transactions on your behalf, we recommend only including one schema change operation per transaction.
