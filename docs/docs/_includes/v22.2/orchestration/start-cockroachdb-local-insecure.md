1. From your local workstation, use our [`cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/cloud/kubernetes/cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml) file to create the StatefulSet that automatically creates 3 pods, each with a CockroachDB node running inside it:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/cockroachdb-statefulset.yaml
    ~~~

    ~~~
    service/cockroachdb-public created
    service/cockroachdb created
    poddisruptionbudget.policy/cockroachdb-budget created
    statefulset.apps/cockroachdb created
    ~~~

1. Confirm that three pods are `Running` successfully. Note that they will not
   be considered `Ready` until after the cluster has been initialized:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl get pods
    ~~~

    ~~~
    NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cockroachdb-0   0/1       Running   0          2m
    cockroachdb-1   0/1       Running   0          2m
    cockroachdb-2   0/1       Running   0          2m
    ~~~

1. Confirm that the persistent volumes and corresponding claims were created successfully for all three pods:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl get pv
    ~~~

    ~~~
    NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS    CLAIM                           REASON    AGE
    pvc-52f51ecf-8bd5-11e6-a4f4-42010a800002   1Gi        RWO           Delete          Bound     default/datadir-cockroachdb-0             26s
    pvc-52fd3a39-8bd5-11e6-a4f4-42010a800002   1Gi        RWO           Delete          Bound     default/datadir-cockroachdb-1             27s
    pvc-5315efda-8bd5-11e6-a4f4-42010a800002   1Gi        RWO           Delete          Bound     default/datadir-cockroachdb-2             27s
    ~~~

1. Use our [`cluster-init.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/cluster-init.yaml) file to perform a one-time initialization that joins the CockroachDB nodes into a single cluster:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl create \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/cluster-init.yaml
    ~~~

    ~~~
    job.batch/cluster-init created
    ~~~

1. Confirm that cluster initialization has completed successfully. The job should be considered successful and the Kubernetes pods should soon be considered `Ready`:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl get job cluster-init
    ~~~

    ~~~
    NAME           COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
    cluster-init   1/1           7s         27s
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl get pods
    ~~~

    ~~~
    NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    cluster-init-cqf8l   0/1     Completed   0          56s
    cockroachdb-0        1/1     Running     0          7m51s
    cockroachdb-1        1/1     Running     0          7m51s
    cockroachdb-2        1/1     Running     0          7m51s
    ~~~

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
The StatefulSet configuration sets all CockroachDB nodes to log to `stderr`, so if you ever need access to a pod/node's logs to troubleshoot, use `kubectl logs <podname>` rather than checking the log on the persistent volume.
