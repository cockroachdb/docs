## Statements table

Click <img src="{{ 'images/common/ui-columns-button.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Column selector" /> to select the columns to display in the table.

The Statements table gives details for each SQL statement fingerprint:

Column | Description
-----|------------
Statements | SQL statement [fingerprint](#sql-statement-fingerprints). To view additional details, click the SQL statement fingerprint to open its [Statement Details page]({{ page_prefix }}statements-page.html#statement-details-page).
Aggregation Interval (UTC) | The interval over which statistics are aggregated. For example, if a statement is executed at 1:23PM it will fall in the 1:00PM - 2:00PM interval.
Execution Count | Cumulative number of executions of statements with this fingerprint within the aggregation interval. <br><br>The bar indicates the ratio of runtime success (gray) to [retries]({{ link_prefix }}transactions.html#transaction-retries) (red) for the SQL statement fingerprint.
Database | The database in which the statement was executed.
Rows Read | Average number of rows [read from disk]({{ link_prefix }}architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html#reads-from-the-storage-layer) while executing statements with this fingerprint within the aggregation interval).<br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of rows returned. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Bytes Read | Aggregation of all bytes [read from disk]({{ link_prefix }}architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html#reads-from-the-storage-layer) across all operators for statements with this fingerprint within the aggregation interval. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of bytes read from disk. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Rows Written  | Aggregation of all rows written to disk across all operators for statements with this fingerprint. This column is not displayed by default. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean latency. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Statement Time | Average [planning and execution time]({{ link_prefix }}architecture/sql-layer.html#sql-parser-planner-executor) of statements with this statement fingerprint within the aggregation interval. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean latency. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Contention | Average time statements with this fingerprint were [in contention]({{ link_prefix }}performance-best-practices-overview.html#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) with other transactions within the aggregation interval. <br><br>The gray bar indicates mean contention time. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Max Memory | Maximum memory used by a statement with this fingerprint at any time during its execution within the aggregation interval. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the average max memory usage. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Network | Amount of [data transferred over the network]({{ link_prefix }}architecture/reads-and-writes-overview.html) for statements with this fingerprint within the aggregation interval. If this value is 0, the statement was executed on a single node. <br><br>The gray bar indicates the mean number of bytes sent over the network. The blue bar indicates one standard deviation from the mean. Hover over the bar to display exact values.
Retries | Cumulative number of automatic (internal) [retries]({{ link_prefix }}transactions.html#transaction-retries) by CockroachDB of statements with this fingerprint within the aggregation interval.
% of All Runtime  | How much time this statement fingerprint took to execute compared to all other statements that were executed within the time period. It is expressed as a percentage. The runtime is the mean execution latency multiplied by the execution count.
Regions/Nodes | The regions and nodes on which statements with this fingerprint executed. <br><br>Regions/Nodes is not visible for {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters.
Diagnostics | Activate and download [diagnostics](#diagnostics) for this fingerprint. To activate, click the **Activate** button. The column displays the status of diagnostics collection (**WAITING**, **READY**, or **ERROR**). When the status is **READY**, click **Download bundle** to download the most recent diagnostics bundle. <br><br>Statements are periodically cleared from the Statements page based on the start time. To access the full history of diagnostics for the fingerprint, see the [Diagnostics](#diagnostics) tab of the Statement Details page. <br><br>Diagnostics is not visible for {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters.
