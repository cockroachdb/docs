To view details for each node in the cluster, use the `cockroach node` [command](cockroach-commands.html) with the appropriate subcommands and flags.

<span class="version-tag">New in v1.1:</span> The `cockroach node` command is also used in the process of decommissioning nodes for permanent removal. See [Remove Nodes](remove-nodes.html) for more details.

## Subcommands

Subcommand | Usage
-----------|------
`ls` | List the ID of each active node in the cluster. This does not include dead nodes or inactive nodes (i.e., nodes that have been decommissioned). To retrieve the IDS for inactive nodes, use `node status --decommision`.
`status` | View the status of one or all nodes. Depending on flags used, this can include details about range/replicas, disk usage, and decommissioning progress.
`decommission` | <span class="version-tag">New in v1.1:</span> Decommission nodes for permanent removal. See [Remove Nodes](remove-nodes.html) for more details.
`recommission` | <span class="version-tag">New in v1.1:</span> Recommission nodes that were accidentally decommissioned. See [Recommission Nodes](remove-nodes.html#recommission-nodes) for more details.

## Flags

All `node` subcommands support the following [general-use](#general) and [logging](#logging) flags.

### General

Flag | Description
-----|------------
`--certs-dir` | The path to the [certificate directory](create-security-certificates.html). The directory must contain valid certificates if running in secure mode.<br><br>**Env Variable:** `COCKROACH_CERTS_DIR`<br>**Default:** `${HOME}/.cockroach-certs/`
`--format` | How to display table rows printed to the standard output. Possible values: `tsv`, `csv`, `pretty`, `records`, `sql`, `html`.<br><br>**Default:** `tsv`
`--host` | The server host to connect to. This can be the address of any node in the cluster. <br><br>**Env Variable:** `COCKROACH_HOST`<br>**Default:** `localhost`
`--insecure` | Run in insecure mode. If this flag is not set, the `--certs-dir` flag must point to valid certificates.<br><br>**Env Variable:** `COCKROACH_INSECURE`<br>**Default:** `false`
`--port` | The server port to connect to. <br><br>**Env Variable:** `COCKROACH_PORT`<br>**Default:** `26257`

The `node status` subcommand also supports the following general flags:

Flag | Description
-----|------------
`--all` | Show all node details.
`--decommission` | Show node decommissioning details.
`--ranges` | Show node details for ranges and replicas.
`--stats` | Show node disk usage details.

The `node decommission` subcommand also supports the following general flag:

Flag | Description
-----|------------
`--wait` | When to return to the client. Possible values: `all`, `live`, `none`.<br><br>If `all`, the command returns to the client only after all specified nodes are fully decommissioned. If any specified nodes are offline, the command won't return to the client until those nodes are back online.<br><br>If `live`, the command returns to the client after all online nodes are fully decommissioned. Any specified nodes that are offline will automatically will be marked as decommissioned; if they come back online, the cluster will recognize this status and will not rebalance data to the nodes.<br><br>If `none`, the command does not wait for decommissioning to finish; it returns to the client after starting the decommissioning process on all specified nodes that are online. Any specified nodes that are offline will automatically be marked as decommissioned; if they come back online, the cluster will recognize this status and will not rebalance data to the nodes.<br><br>**Default:** `all`

### Logging

By default, the `node` command logs errors to `stderr`.

If you need to troubleshoot this command's behavior, you can change its [logging behavior](debug-and-error-logs.html).

## Response

The `cockroach node` subcommands return the following fields for each node.

### `node ls`

Field | Description
------|------------
`id` | The ID of the node.

### `node status`

Field | Description
------|------------
`id` | The ID of the node.<br><br>**Required flag:** None
`address` | The address of the node.<br><br>**Required flag:** None
`build` | The version of CockroachDB running on the node. If the binary was built from source, this will be the SHA hash of the commit used.<br><br>**Required flag:** None
`updated_at` | The date and time when the node last reported its status.<br><br>**Required flag:** None
`started_at` | The date and time when the node was started.<br><br>**Required flag:** None

`replicas_leaseholders` | The number of range replicas on the node that are the leaseholder for their range. A "leaseholder" replica handles all read requests for a range and directs write requests to the range's Raft leader (usually the same replica as the leaseholder).<br><br>**Required flag:** `--ranges` or `--all`
