---

This page walks you through a simple demonstration of how CockroachDB remains available during, and recovers after, failure. Starting with a 3-node local cluster, you'll remove a node and see how the cluster continues uninterrupted. You'll then write some data while the node is offline, rejoin the node, and see how it catches up with the rest of the cluster. Finally, you'll add a fourth node, remove a node again, and see how missing replicas eventually re-replicate to the new node.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have already [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).

## Step 1. Start a 3-node cluster

Use the [`cockroach start`](start-a-node.html) command to start 3 nodes:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
# In a new terminal, start node 1:
$ cockroach start \
--insecure \
--store=fault-node1 \
--host=localhost
--port=26257 \
--http-port=8080 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
# In a new terminal, start node 2:
$ cockroach start \
--insecure \
--store=fault-node2 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26258 \
--http-port=8081 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
# In a new terminal, start node 3:
$ cockroach start \
--insecure \
--store=fault-node3 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26259 \
--http-port=8082 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

## Step 2. Initialize the cluster

In a new terminal, use the [`cockroach init`](initialize-a-cluster.html) command to perform a one-time initialization of the cluster:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach init \
--insecure \
--host=localhost \
--port=26257
~~~

## Step 3. Verify that the cluster is live

In a new terminal, use the [`cockroach sql`](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) command to connect the built-in SQL shell to any node:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure --port=26257
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW DATABASES;
~~~

~~~
+--------------------+
|      Database      |
+--------------------+
| crdb_internal      |
| information_schema |
| pg_catalog         |
| system             |
+--------------------+
(4 rows)
~~~

Exit the SQL shell:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~

## Step 4. Remove a node temporarily

In the terminal running node 2, press **CTRL + C** to stop the node.

Alternatively, you can open a new terminal and run the [`cockroach quit`](stop-a-node.html) command against port `26258`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach quit --insecure --port=26258
~~~

~~~
initiating graceful shutdown of server
ok
~~~

## Step 5. Verify that the cluster remains available

Switch to the terminal for the built-in SQL shell and reconnect the shell to node 1 (port `26257`) or node 3 (port `26259`):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure --port=26259
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW DATABASES;
~~~

~~~
+--------------------+
|      Database      |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| pg_catalog         |
| bank               |
| system             |
+--------------------+
(4 rows)
~~~

As you see, despite one node being offline, the cluster continues uninterrupted because a majority of replicas (2/3) remains available. If you were to remove another node, however, leaving only one node live, the cluster would be unresponsive until another node was brought back online.

Exit the SQL shell:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~

## Step 6. Write data while the node is offline

In the same terminal, use the [`cockroach gen`](generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) command to generate an example `startrek` database:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach gen example-data startrek | cockroach sql --insecure
~~~

~~~
CREATE DATABASE
SET
DROP TABLE
DROP TABLE
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 79
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 200
~~~

Then reconnect the SQL shell to node 1 (port `26257`) or node 3 (port `26259`) and verify that the new `startrek` database was added with two tables, `episodes` and `quotes`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure --port=26259
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW DATABASES;
~~~

~~~
+--------------------+
|      Database      |
+--------------------+
| crdb_internal      |
| information_schema |
| pg_catalog         |
| startrek           |
| system             |
+--------------------+
(5 rows)
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW TABLES FROM startrek;
~~~

~~~
+----------+
|  Table   |
+----------+
| episodes |
| quotes   |
+----------+
(2 rows)
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM startrek.episodes LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
+----+--------+-----+--------------------------------+----------+
| id | season | num |             title              | stardate |
+----+--------+-----+--------------------------------+----------+
|  1 |      1 |   1 | The Man Trap                   |   1531.1 |
|  2 |      1 |   2 | Charlie X                      |   1533.6 |
|  3 |      1 |   3 | Where No Man Has Gone Before   |   1312.4 |
|  4 |      1 |   4 | The Naked Time                 |   1704.2 |
|  5 |      1 |   5 | The Enemy Within               |   1672.1 |
|  6 |      1 |   6 | Mudd's Women                   |   1329.8 |
|  7 |      1 |   7 | What Are Little Girls Made Of? |   2712.4 |
|  8 |      1 |   8 | Miri                           |   2713.5 |
|  9 |      1 |   9 | Dagger of the Mind             |   2715.1 |
| 10 |      1 |  10 | The Corbomite Maneuver         |   1512.2 |
+----+--------+-----+--------------------------------+----------+
(10 rows)
~~~

Exit the SQL shell:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> \q
~~~

## Step 7. Rejoin the node to the cluster

Switch to the terminal for node 2, and rejoin the node to the cluster, using the same command that you used in step 1:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach start --insecure \
--store=fault-node2 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26258 \
--http-port=8081 \
--join=localhost:26257
~~~

~~~
CockroachDB node starting at {{page.release_info.start_time}}
build:      CCL {{page.release_info.version}} @ {{page.release_info.build_time}}
admin:      http://localhost:8081
sql:        postgresql://root@localhost:26258?sslmode=disable
logs:       node2/logs
store[0]:   path=fault-node2
status:     restarted pre-existing node
clusterID:  {5638ba53-fb77-4424-ada9-8a23fbce0ae9}
nodeID:     2
~~~

## Step 8. Verify that the rejoined node has caught up

Switch to the terminal for the built-in SQL shell, connect the shell to the rejoined node 2 (port `26258`), and check for the `startrek` data that was added while the node was offline:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure --port=26258
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SELECT * FROM startrek.episodes LIMIT 10;
~~~

~~~
+----+--------+-----+--------------------------------+----------+
| id | season | num |             title              | stardate |
+----+--------+-----+--------------------------------+----------+
|  1 |      1 |   1 | The Man Trap                   |   1531.1 |
|  2 |      1 |   2 | Charlie X                      |   1533.6 |
|  3 |      1 |   3 | Where No Man Has Gone Before   |   1312.4 |
|  4 |      1 |   4 | The Naked Time                 |   1704.2 |
|  5 |      1 |   5 | The Enemy Within               |   1672.1 |
|  6 |      1 |   6 | Mudd's Women                   |   1329.8 |
|  7 |      1 |   7 | What Are Little Girls Made Of? |   2712.4 |
|  8 |      1 |   8 | Miri                           |   2713.5 |
|  9 |      1 |   9 | Dagger of the Mind             |   2715.1 |
| 10 |      1 |  10 | The Corbomite Maneuver         |   1512.2 |
+----+--------+-----+--------------------------------+----------+
(10 rows)
~~~

At first, while node 2 is catching up, it acts as a proxy to one of the other nodes with the data. This shows that even when a copy of the data is not local to the node, it has seamless access.

Soon enough, node 2 catches up entirely. To verify, open the Admin UI at `http://localhost:8080`, click **View nodes list** on the right, and you'll see that all three nodes are listed, and the replica count is identical for each. This means that all data in the cluster has been replicated 3 times; there's a copy of every piece of data on each node.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}CockroachDB replicates data 3 times by default. You can customize the number and location of replicas for the entire cluster or for specific sets of data using <a href="configure-replication-zones.html">replication zones</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Step 9. Add another node

Now, to prepare the cluster for a permanent node failure, open a new terminal and add a fourth node:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach start \
--insecure \
--store=fault-node4 \
--host=localhost \
--port=26260 \
--http-port=8083 \
--join=localhost:26257,localhost:26258,localhost:26259
~~~

~~~
CockroachDB node starting at {{page.release_info.start_time}}
build:      CCL {{page.release_info.version}} @ {{page.release_info.build_time}}
admin:      http://localhost:8083
sql:        postgresql://root@localhost:26260?sslmode=disable
logs:       node4/logs
store[0]:   path=fault-node4
status:     initialized new node, joined pre-existing cluster
clusterID:  {5638ba53-fb77-4424-ada9-8a23fbce0ae9}
nodeID:     4
~~~

## Step 10. Remove a node permanently

Again, switch to the terminal running node 2 and press **CTRL + C** to stop it.

Alternatively, you can open a new terminal and run the [`cockroach quit`](stop-a-node.html) command against port `26258`:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach quit --insecure --port=26258
~~~

~~~
initiating graceful shutdown of server
ok
server drained and shutdown completed
~~~

## Step 11. Verify that the cluster re-replicates missing replicas

Back in the Admin UI, you'll see 4 nodes listed. After about 1 minute, the dot next to node 2 will turn yellow, indicating that the node is not responding.

<img src="{{ 'images/recovery2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

After about 10 minutes, node 2 will move into a **Dead Nodes** section, indicating that the node is not expected to come back. At this point, in the **Live Nodes** section, you should also see that the **Replicas** count for node 4 matches the count for node 1 and 3, the other live nodes. This indicates that all missing replicas (those that were on node 2) have been re-replicated to node 4.

<img src="{{ 'images/recovery3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="CockroachDB Admin UI" style="border:1px solid #eee;max-width:100%" />

## Step 12.  Stop the cluster

Once you're done with your test cluster, stop each node by switching to its terminal and pressing **CTRL + C**.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}For the last node, the shutdown process will take longer (about a minute) and will eventually force kill the node. This is because, with only 1 node still online, a majority of replicas are no longer available (2 of 3), and so the cluster is not operational. To speed up the process, press <strong>CTRL + C</strong> a second time.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

If you don't plan to restart the cluster, you may want to remove the nodes' data stores:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ rm -rf fault-node1 fault-node2 fault-node3 fault-node4 fault-node5
~~~
