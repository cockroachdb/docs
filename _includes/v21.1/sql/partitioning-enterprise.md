Partitioning is an enterprise-only feature. Each instance of `cockroach demo` loads a temporary enterprise license that expires after 24 hours. If you want to use enterprise-only features outside of a `cockroach demo` instance, [request a trial enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise), and then [set the license key](licensing-faqs.html#set-a-license).
