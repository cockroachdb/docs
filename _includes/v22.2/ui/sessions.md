Click <img src="{{ 'images/common/ui-columns-button.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Column selector" /> to select the columns to display in the table.

The following properties are displayed for each session:

Column | Description
--------- | -----------
Session Start Time (UTC) | The timestamp at which the session started.
Session Duration | The amount of time the session has been open.
Session Active Duration | The amount of time transactions were executing while the session was open.
Status  | The status of the session: `Active`,  `Idle`, or `Closed`. A session is `Active` if it has an open explicit or implicit transaction (individual SQL statement) with a statement that is actively running or waiting to acquire a lock. A session is `Idle` if it has no open transaction. A session is `Closed` if it has closed the connection to CockroachDB.
Most Recent Statement | If more than one statement is executing, the most recent statement. If the session is Idle, the last statement.
Statement Start Time (UTC) | The timestamp at which the statement started.
Transaction Count | The number of transactions completed in the session.
Memory Usage | Amount of memory currently allocated to the session followed by the maximum amount of memory the session has ever been allocated.
Client IP Address | The IP address and port of the client that opened the session.
User Name | The user that opened the session.
Application Name | The application that ran the session.
Actions | Options to cancel the active statement and cancel the session. These require the `CANCELQUERY` [role option]({{ link_prefix }}alter-role.html#role-options).<ul><li>**Cancel Statement:** Ends the SQL statement. The session running this statement will receive an error. </li> <li>**Cancel Session:** Ends the session. The client that holds this session will receive a "connection terminated" event.</li></ul>

To view details of a session, click a **Session Start Time (UTC)** to display session details.
