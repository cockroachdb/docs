**Expected values for a healthy cluster**: At any time, the total number of actively executing SQL statements should not exceed 4 times the number of vCPUs in the cluster. You can find them in the Active Executions view in the [DB Console](ui-statements-page.html) or [Cloud Console](../cockroachcloud/statements-page.html). When configuring connection pools, make sure the number of connections doesn't exceed 4 times the number of vCPUs in the cluster. You can find the number of open connections in the [DB Console](ui-sql-dashboard.html#open-sql-sessions) or [Cloud Console](../cockroachcloud/metrics-page.html#sql-open-sessions). For more details, see [Sizing connection pools](connection-pooling.html#sizing-connection-pools).
