`exec.error` | Number of batch KV requests that failed to execute on this node. This count excludes transaction restart/abort errors. However, it will include other errors expected during normal operation, such as ConditionFailedError. This metric is thus not an indicator of KV health.
`exec.latency` | Latency of batch KV requests (including errors) executed on this node. This measures requests already addressed to a single replica, from the moment at which they arrive at the internal gRPC endpoint to the moment at which the response (or an error) is returned. This latency includes in particular commit waits, conflict resolution and replication, and end-users can easily produce high measurements via long-running transactions that conflict with foreground traffic. This metric thus does not provide a good signal for understanding the health of the KV layer.
`exec.success` | Number of batch KV requests executed successfully on this node. A request is considered to have executed 'successfully' if it either returns a result or a transaction restart/abort error.

`raft.commandsapplied` | Count of Raft commands applied. This measurement is taken on the Raft apply loops of all Replicas (leaders and followers alike), meaning that it does not measure the number of Raft commands *proposed* (in the hypothetical extreme case, all Replicas may apply all commands through snapshots, thus not increasing this metric at all). Instead, it is a proxy for how much work is being done advancing the Replica state machines on this node.
`raft.heartbeats.pending` | Number of pending heartbeats and responses waiting to be coalesced
`raft.process.commandcommit.latency` | Latency histogram for applying a batch of Raft commands to the state machine. This metric is misnamed: it measures the latency for *applying* a batch of committed Raft commands to a Replica state machine. This requires only non-durable I/O (except for replication configuration changes). Note that a "batch" in this context is really a sub-batch of the batch received for application during Raft ready handling. The 'raft.process.applycommitted.latency' histogram is likely more suitable in most cases, as it measures the total latency across all sub-batches (i.e., the sum of commandcommit.latency for a complete batch).
`raft.process.logcommit.latency` | Latency histogram for committing Raft log entries to stable storage. This measures the latency of durably committing a group of newly received Raft entries as well as the HardState entry to disk. This excludes any data processing, i.e., we measure purely the commit latency of the resulting Engine write. Homogeneous bands of p50-p99 latencies (in the presence of regular Raft traffic), make it likely that the storage layer is healthy. Spikes in the latency bands can either hint at the presence of large sets of Raft entries being received, or at performance issues at the storage layer.
`raft.process.tickingnanos` | Nanoseconds spent in store.processRaft() processing replica.Tick()
`raft.process.workingnanos` | Nanoseconds spent in store.processRaft() working. This is the sum of the measurements passed to the raft.process.handleready.latency histogram.

`raft.rcvd.prop` | Number of MsgProp messages received by this store
`raft.rcvd.snap` | Number of MsgSnap messages received by this store
`raft.rcvd.timeoutnow` | Number of MsgTimeoutNow messages received by this store
`raft.rcvd.transferleader` | Number of MsgTransferLeader messages received by this store
`raft.rcvd.vote` | Number of MsgVote messages received by this store
`raft.rcvd.voteresp` | Number of MsgVoteResp messages received by this store
`raft.ticks` | Number of Raft ticks queued
`raftlog.behind` | Number of Raft log entries followers on other stores are behind. This gauge provides a view of the aggregate number of log entries the Raft leaders on this node think the followers are behind. Since a Raft leader may not always have a good estimate for this information for all of its followers, and since followers are expected to be behind (when they are not required as part of a quorum) *and* the aggregate thus scales like the count of such followers, it is difficult to meaningfully interpret this metric.
`raftlog.truncated` | Number of Raft log entries truncated
`range.adds` | Number of range additions
`range.raftleadertransfers` | Number of Raft leader transfers
`range.removes` | Number of range removals
`range.snapshots.generated` | Number of generated snapshots

`replicas.quiescent` | Number of quiesced replicas
`replicas.reserved` | Number of replicas reserved for snapshots
`replicas` | Number of replicas
`requests.backpressure.split` | Number of backpressured writes waiting on a range split. A range will backpressure (roughly) non-system traffic when the range is above the configured size until the range splits. When the rate of this metric is nonzero over extended periods of time, it should be investigated why splits are not occurring.
`requests.slow.distsender` | Number of replica-bound RPCs currently stuck or retrying for a long time. Note that this is not a good signal for KV health. The remote side of the RPCs tracked here may experience contention, so an end user can easily cause values for this metric to be emitted by leaving a transaction open for a long time and contending with it using a second transaction.
`requests.slow.lease` | Number of requests that have been stuck for a long time acquiring a lease. A nonzero value usually indicates range or replica unavailability, and should be investigated. Commonly, `requests.slow.raft` is also a nonzero value, which indicates that the lease requests are not getting a timely response from the replication layer.
`requests.slow.raft` | Number of requests that have been stuck for a long time in the replication layer. An (evaluated) request has to pass through the replication layer, notably the quota pool and Raft. If it fails to do so within a highly permissive duration, this metric is incremented (and decremented again once the request is either applied or returns an error). A nonzero value indicates range or replica unavailability, and should be investigated.
