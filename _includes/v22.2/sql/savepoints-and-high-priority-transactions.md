[`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](rollback-transaction.html#rollback-a-nested-transaction) (for either regular savepoints or "restart savepoints" defined with `cockroach_restart`) causes a "feature not supported" error after a DDL statement in a [`HIGH PRIORITY` transaction](transactions.html#transaction-priorities), in order to avoid a transaction deadlock. For more information, see GitHub issue [#46414](https://www.github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/46414).
