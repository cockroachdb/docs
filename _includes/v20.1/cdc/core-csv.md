To determine how wide the columns need to be, the default `table` display format in `cockroach sql` buffers the results it receives from the server before printing them to the console. When consuming core changefeed data using `cockroach sql`, it's important to use a display format like `csv` that does not buffer its results. To set the display format, use the [`--format=csv` flag](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#sql-flag-format) when starting the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html), or set the [`\set display_format=csv` option](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#client-side-options) once the SQL client is open.
