The generated physical query plan is encoded into a byte string after the [fragment identifier (`#`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier) in the generated URL. The fragment is not sent to the web server; instead, the browser waits for the web server to return a `decode.html` resource, and then JavaScript on the web page decodes the fragment into a physical query plan diagram. The query plan is, therefore, not logged by a server external to the CockroachDB cluster and not exposed to the public internet.
