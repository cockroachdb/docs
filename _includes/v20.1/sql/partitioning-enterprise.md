Partitioning is an enterprise-only feature. Each instance of `cockroach demo` loads a temporary enterprise license that expires after an hour. If you want to use enterprise-only features outside of a `cockroach demo` instance, [request a trial enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/), and then [set the license key](enterprise-licensing.html#set-a-license).
