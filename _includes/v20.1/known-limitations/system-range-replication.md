Changes to the [`default` cluster-wide replication zone](configure-replication-zones.html#edit-the-default-replication-zone) are automatically applied to existing replication zones, including pre-configured zones for important system ranges that must remain available for the cluster as a whole to remain available. The zones for these system ranges have an initial replication factor of 5 to make them more resilient to node failure. However, if you increase the `default` zone's replication factor above 5, consider [increasing the replication factor for important system ranges](configure-replication-zones.html#create-a-replication-zone-for-a-system-range) as well.
