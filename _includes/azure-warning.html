{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}On <a href="deploy-cockroachdb-on-microsoft-azure.html">Microsoft Azure</a>, A-series VMs can come back from VM migrations with bad filesystems, which can in turn cause data corruption and performance degradation. We therefore recommend not using A-series VMs. Instead, use D-series VMs, which have not been seen to exhibit these problems. Before using any other Azure VM series in production, you should test them extensively.{{site.data.alerts.end}}
