- You can only apply CDC queries on a single table in each statement.
- Some [stable functions](functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions), notably functions that return MVCC timestamps, are overridden to return the MVCC timestamp of the event.
- You cannot [alter](alter-changefeed.html) a changefeed that uses CDC queries. [Tracking GitHub issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/83033)
- The following are not permitted in CDC queries:
    - [Volatile functions](functions-and-operators.html#function-volatility)
    - Sub-select queries
    - [Aggregate](functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) and [window functions](window-functions.html) (i.e., functions operating over many rows).
- If a table has a boolean column, referring to the column in a `WHERE` clause can result in an error message: `expected boolean expression, found expression of type bool`. A workaround for this issue is to construct the clause as per the following: `WHERE IF(column, TRUE, FALSE)`. [Tracking GitHub issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/90411)
- `delete` changefeed events will not contain any content in the output message. [Tracking GitHub issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/83835)
