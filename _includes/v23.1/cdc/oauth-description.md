[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication uses a third-party provider's credentials to authenticate with Kafka instead of you providing your Kafka cluster credentials directly in a [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](create-changefeed.html) statement. Your provider's authentication server will issue a temporary token, which gives flexibility for you to apply access rules on the credentials from your provider.
