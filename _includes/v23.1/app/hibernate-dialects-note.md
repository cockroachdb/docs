Versions of the Hibernate CockroachDB dialect correspond to the version of CockroachDB installed on your machine. For example, `org.hibernate.dialect.CockroachDB201Dialect` corresponds to CockroachDB v20.1 and later, and `org.hibernate.dialect.CockroachDB192Dialect` corresponds to CockroachDB v19.2 and later.

All dialect versions are forward-compatible (e.g., CockroachDB v20.1 is compatible with `CockroachDB192Dialect`), as long as your application is not affected by any backward-incompatible changes listed in your CockroachDB version's [release notes](../releases/index.html). In the event of a CockroachDB version upgrade, using a previous version of the CockroachDB dialect will not break an application, but, to enable all features available in your version of CockroachDB, we recommend keeping the dialect version in sync with the installed version of CockroachDB.

Not all versions of CockroachDB have a corresponding dialect yet. Use the dialect number that is closest to your installed version of CockroachDB. For example, use `CockroachDB201Dialect` when using CockroachDB v21.1 and later.
