CockroachDB breaks data into ranges. By default, CockroachDB attempts to keep ranges below a size of 512 MiB. To do this, the system will automatically [split a range](architecture/distribution-layer.html#range-splits) if it grows larger than this limit. For most use cases, this automatic range splitting is sufficient, and you should never need to worry about when or where the system decides to split ranges.

However, there are reasons why you may want to perform manual splits on the ranges that store tables or indexes:

- When a table only consists of a single range, all writes and reads to the table will be served by that range's [leaseholder](architecture/replication-layer.html#leases). If a table only holds a small amount of data but is serving a large amount of traffic, load distribution can become unbalanced. Splitting the table's ranges manually can allow the load on the table to be more evenly distributed across multiple nodes. For tables consisting of more than a few ranges, load will naturally be distributed across multiple nodes and this will not be a concern.

- When a table is created, it will only consist of a single range. If you know that a new table will immediately receive significant write traffic, you may want to preemptively split the table based on the expected distribution of writes before applying the load. This can help avoid reduced workload performance that results when automatic splits are unable to keep up with write traffic.
