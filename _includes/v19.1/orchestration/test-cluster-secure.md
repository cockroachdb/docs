To use the built-in SQL client, you need to launch a pod that runs indefinitely with the `cockroach` binary inside it, get a shell into the pod, and then start the built-in SQL client.

<section class="filter-content" markdown="1" data-scope="manual">
1. From your local workstation, use our [`client-secure.yaml`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml) file to launch a pod and keep it running indefinitely:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml
    ~~~

    ~~~
    pod "cockroachdb-client-secure" created
    ~~~

    The pod uses the `root` client certificate created earlier to initialize the cluster, so there's no CSR approval required.

2. Get a shell into the pod and start the CockroachDB [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    $ kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public
    ~~~

    ~~~
    # Welcome to the cockroach SQL interface.
    # All statements must be terminated by a semicolon.
    # To exit: CTRL + D.
    #
    # Server version: CockroachDB CCL v1.1.2 (linux amd64, built 2017/11/02 19:32:03, go1.8.3) (same version as client)
    # Cluster ID: 3292fe08-939f-4638-b8dd-848074611dba
    #
    # Enter \? for a brief introduction.
    #
    root@cockroachdb-public:26257/>
    ~~~

3. Run some basic [CockroachDB SQL statements](learn-cockroachdb-sql.html):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE DATABASE bank;
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE TABLE bank.accounts (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance DECIMAL);
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > INSERT INTO bank.accounts VALUES (1, 1000.50);
    ~~~

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM bank.accounts;
    ~~~

    ~~~
    +----+---------+
    | id | balance |
    +----+---------+
    |  1 |  1000.5 |
    +----+---------+
    (1 row)
    ~~~

4. [Create a user with a password](create-user.html#create-a-user-with-a-password):

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > CREATE USER roach WITH PASSWORD 'Q7gc8rEdS';
    ~~~

      You will need this username and password to access the Admin UI later.

5. Exit the SQL shell and pod:

    {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > \q
    ~~~

1. From your local workstation, use our [`client-secure.yaml`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml) file to launch a pod and keep it running indefinitely.

    1. Download the file:

        {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ shell
        $ curl -OOOOOOOOO \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/master/cloud/kubernetes/client-secure.yaml
        ~~~

    1. In the file, change `serviceAccountName: cockroachdb` to `serviceAccountName: my-release-cockroachdb`.

    1. Use the file to launch a pod and keep it running indefinitely:

        {% include copy-clipboard.html %}
        ~~~ shell
        $ kubectl create -f client-secure.yaml
        ~~~

        ~~~
        pod "cockroachdb-client-secure" created
        ~~~

        The pod uses the `root` client certificate created earlier to initialize the cluster, so there's no CSR approval required.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_success}}
This pod will continue running indefinitely, so any time you need to reopen the built-in SQL client or run any other [`cockroach` client commands](cockroach-commands.html) (e.g., `cockroach node`), repeat step 2 using the appropriate `cockroach` command.

If you'd prefer to delete the pod and recreate it when needed, run `kubectl delete pod cockroachdb-client-secure`.
