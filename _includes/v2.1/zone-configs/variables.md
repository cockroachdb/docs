Variable | Description
------|------------
`range_min_bytes` | The minimum size, in bytes, for a range of data in the zone. When a range reaches this size, CockroachDB will spit it into two ranges.<br><br>**Default:** `1048576` (1MiB)
`range_max_bytes` | The maximum size, in bytes, for a range of data in the zone. When a range reaches this size, CockroachDB will spit it into two ranges.<br><br>**Default:** `67108864` (64MiB)
`gc.ttlseconds` | The number of seconds overwritten values will be retained before garbage collection. Smaller values can save disk space if values are frequently overwritten; larger values increase the range allowed for `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries, also know as [Time Travel Queries](select-clause.html#select-historical-data-time-travel).<br><br>It is not recommended to set this below `600` (10 minutes); doing so will cause problems for long-running queries. Also, since all versions of a row are stored in a single range that never splits, it is not recommended to set this so high that all the changes to a row in that time period could add up to more than 64MiB; such oversized ranges could contribute to the server running out of memory or other problems.<br><br>**Default:** `90000` (25 hours)
`num_replicas` | The number of replicas in the zone.<br><br>**Default:** `3`
`constraints` | An array of required (`+`) and/or prohibited (`-`) constraints influencing the location of replicas. See [Types of Constraints](configure-replication-zones.html#types-of-constraints) and [Scope of Constraints](configure-replication-zones.html#scope-of-constraints) for more details.<br/><br/>To prevent hard-to-detect typos, constraints placed on [store attributes and node localities](configure-replication-zones.html#descriptive-attributes-assigned-to-nodes) must match the values passed to at least one node in the cluster. If not, an error is signalled.<br/><br/>**Default:** No constraints, with CockroachDB locating each replica on a unique node and attempting to spread replicas evenly across localities.
