In addition to the databases and tables that are visible via the SQL interface, CockroachDB stores internal data in what are called system ranges. CockroachDB comes with pre-configured replication zones for some of these ranges:

Zone Name | Description
----------|-----------------------------
`.meta` | The "meta" ranges contain the authoritative information about the location of all data in the cluster.<br><br>Because historical queries are never run on meta ranges and it is advantageous to keep these ranges smaller for reliable performance, CockroachDB comes with a **pre-configured** `.meta` replication zone giving these ranges a lower-than-default `gc.ttlseconds`.<br><br>If your cluster is running in multiple datacenters, it's a best practice to configure the meta ranges to have a copy in each datacenter.
`.liveness` | The "liveness" range contains the authoritative information about which nodes are live at any given time.<br><br>Just as for "meta" ranges, historical queries are never run on the liveness range, so CockroachDB comes with a **pre-configured** `.liveness` replication zone giving this range a lower-than-default `gc.ttlseconds`.<br><br>**If this range is unavailable, the entire cluster will be unavailable, so giving it a high replication factor is strongly recommended.**
`.timeseries` | The "timeseries" ranges contain monitoring data about the cluster that powers the graphs in CockroachDB's Admin UI. If necessary, you can add a `.timeseries` replication zone to control the replication of this data.
`.system` | There are system ranges for a variety of other important internal data, including information needed to allocate new table IDs and track the status of a cluster's nodes. If necessary, you can add a `.system` replication zone to control the replication of this data.

{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
Use caution when editing replication zones for system ranges, as they could cause some (or all) parts of your cluster to stop working.

To control replication for one of the above sets of system ranges, use the `ALTER RANGE ... CONFIGURE ZONE` statement to define the values you want to change (other values will not be affected):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> ALTER RANGE system CONFIGURE ZONE USING num_replicas = 7, gc.ttlseconds = 100000;
~~~

~~~
CONFIGURE ZONE 1
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ sql
> SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR RANGE meta;
~~~

~~~
   zone_name  |              config_sql
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
  .system     | ALTER RANGE meta CONFIGURE ZONE USING
              |     range_min_bytes = 1048576,
              |     range_max_bytes = 67108864,
              |     gc.ttlseconds = 100000,
              |     num_replicas = 7,
              |     constraints = '[]',
              |     lease_preferences = '[]'
