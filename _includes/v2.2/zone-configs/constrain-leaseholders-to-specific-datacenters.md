In addition to [constraining replicas to specific datacenters](configure-replication-zones.html#per-replica-constraints-to-specific-datacenters), you may also specify preferences for where the range's leaseholders should be placed.  This can result in increased performance in some scenarios.

The [`ALTER TABLE ... CONFIGURE ZONE`](configure-zone.html) statement below requires that the cluster try to place the ranges' leaseholders in zone `us-east-1b`; if that is not possible, it will try to place them in zone `us-east-1a`.

For more information about how the `lease_preferences` field works, see its description in the [Replication zone variables](configure-replication-zones.html#replication-zone-variables) section.
