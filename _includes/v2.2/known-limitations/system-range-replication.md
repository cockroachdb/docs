Changes to the [`.default` cluster-wide replication zone](configure-replication-zones.html#edit-the-default-replication-zone) are not automatically applied to existing replication zones, including those for important internal data. For the cluster as a whole to remain available, the "system ranges" for this internal data must always retain a majority of their replicas. Therefore, if you increase the default replication factor, be sure to also [increase the replication factor for important internal data](configure-replication-zones.html#create-a-replication-zone-for-a-system-range) as well.
