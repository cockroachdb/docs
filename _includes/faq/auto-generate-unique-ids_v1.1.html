To auto-generate unique row IDs, use the [`UUID`](uuid.html) column with the `uuid_v4()` function cast to `UUID` as the default value:

~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE new_test (id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_v4()::UUID, name STRING);
~~~

Alternatively, you can use the [`BYTES`](bytes.html) column with the `uuid_v4()` function as the default value instead:

~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE test (id BYTES PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_v4(), name STRING);
~~~

In cases where you specifically need time-locality for unique row IDs, use the [`SERIAL`](serial.html) data type, which is an alias for [`INT`](int.html) with the `unique_rowid()` [function](functions-and-operators.html#id-generation-functions) as the [default value](default-value.html). On insert, the `unique_rowid()` function generates a default value from the timestamp and ID of the node executing the insert:

~~~ sql
> CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name STRING);
~~~

The `SERIAL` values are likely to be globally unique except in cases where a very large number of IDs (100,000+) are generated per node per second. Because `BYTES` and `UUID` values are 128-bit, much larger than `INT` values at 64-bit, there is virtually no chance of generating non-unique values. 

The distribution of IDs at the key-value level may also be a consideration. When using `BYTES` or `UUID` with `uuid_v4()` as the default value, consecutively generated IDs will be spread across different key-value ranges (and therefore likely across different nodes), whereas when using `INT` with `unique_rowid()` as the default value, consecutively generated IDs may end up in the same key-value range.
