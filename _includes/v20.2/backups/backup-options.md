`revision_history`<a name="with-revision-history"></a>           | N/A                     | Create a backup with full [revision history](take-backups-with-revision-history-and-restore-from-a-point-in-time.html), which records every change made to the cluster within the garbage collection period leading up to and including the given timestamp.
`encryption_passphrase`<a name="with-encryption-passphrase"></a> | [`STRING`](string.html) | The passphrase used to [encrypt the files](take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html) (`BACKUP` manifest and data files) that the `BACKUP` statement generates. This same passphrase is needed to decrypt the file when it is used to [restore](take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html) and to list the contents of the backup when using [`SHOW BACKUP`](show-backup.html).
`detached`                                                       | N/A                     | <span class="version-tag">New in v20.2:</span> When a backup runs in `detached` mode, the backup job will execute asynchronously and the job ID will be returned immediately without waiting for the job to finish. Note that the job completion status will not be returned. To check on the job status, use the [`SHOW JOBS`](show-jobs.html) statement.
