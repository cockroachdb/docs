For performance reasons, we discourage [indexing on sequential keys](indexes.html). If, however, you are working with a table that must be indexed on sequential keys, you should use [hash-sharded indexes](hash-sharded-indexes.html). Hash-sharded indexes distribute sequential traffic uniformly across ranges, eliminating single-range hot spots and improving write performance on sequentially-keyed indexes at a small cost to read performance.
