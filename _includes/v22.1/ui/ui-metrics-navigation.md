## Dashboard navigation

Use the **Graph** menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a specific node:

- When set to **Graph: Cluster**, data is aggregated together for all nodes in your cluster.
- When set to **Graph: {node}**, only data for the specific selected node is shown.

To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a time interval selector allows you to filter the view for a predefined or custom time interval. Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current time interval. When you select a time interval, the same interval is selected in the [SQL Activity](ui-overview.html#sql-activity) pages. However, if you select 10 or 30 minutes, the interval defaults to 1 hour in SQL Activity pages.
