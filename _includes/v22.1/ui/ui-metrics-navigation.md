## Dashboard navigation

Use the **Graph** menu to display metrics for your entire cluster or for a specific node:

- When set to **Graph: Cluster**, data is aggregated together for all nodes in your cluster.
- When set to **Graph: {node}**, only data for the specific selected node is shown.

To the right of the Graph and Dashboard menus, a range selector allows you to filter the view for a predefined timeframe or custom date/time range. Use the navigation buttons to move to the previous, next, or current timeframe. Note that the active timeframe is reflected in the URL and can be easily shared.
