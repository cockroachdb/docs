<span class="version-tag">New in v22.1</span>: To control the maximum number of non-superuser ([`root`](security-reference/authorization.html#root-user) user or other [`admin` role](security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role)) connections a [gateway node](architecture/sql-layer.html#gateway-node) can have open at one time, use the `server.max_connections_per_gateway` [cluster setting](cluster-settings.html).  If a new non-superuser connection would exceed this limit, the error message `"sorry, too many clients already"` is returned, along with error code `53300`.
