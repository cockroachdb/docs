1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string that you copied in Step 2:

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ shell
    export DATABASE_URL="<connection-string>"
    ~~~

    The code sample uses the connection string stored in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` to connect to your cluster.
