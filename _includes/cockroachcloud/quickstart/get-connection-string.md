    The connection string is pre-populated with your username, password, cluster name, and other details. Your password, in particular, will be provided *only once*. Save it in a secure place (Cockroach Labs recommends a password manager) to connect to your cluster in the future. If you forget your password, you can reset it by going to the [**SQL Users** page](user-authorization.html).
