    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    We recommend that {{ site.data.products.db }} Console users log in with [Single Sign-On (SSO)](cloud-sso.html), with two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled for the SSO provider. This prevents potential attackers from using stolen credentials to accesss or tamper with your critical data.

    {{ site.data.products.db }} currently supports SSO with GitHub, Google, and Microsoft.

    Visit your {{ site.data.products.db }} Console's [account settings page](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/account/profile) and switch to SSO to improve the security of your cluster.
