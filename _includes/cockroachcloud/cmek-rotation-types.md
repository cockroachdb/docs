You can rotate a CMEK key within your KMS platform or within {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}.

- When you rotate a CMEK key within your KMS platform, a new version of the key is created with new key material, and this becomes the active key version. In both GCP KMS and AWS KMS, encryption operations automatically use the active key version, while decryption operations automatically use the key version that was used to encrypt the data. For this reason, {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} does not need any awareness of rotation operations within your KMS platform. However, {{ site.data.products.db }} will not re-encrypt the store key using the rotated CMEK key until you also perform a rotation using the {{ site.data.products.db }} API.

- When you rotate a CMEK key using the {{ site.data.products.db }} API, you supply a CMEK KEY URI for each region you want to update, and {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} begins using the new key to protect the store key.
