The best way to estimate your resource usage is to [enter a spend limit](serverless-cluster-management.html#edit-your-spend-limit) you're comfortable with and run your workload. You can see the RUs and storage your cluster has used in the **Usage this month** section of the [**Cluster Overview**](serverless-cluster-management.html#view-cluster-overview) page. Once enough usage data is available, you can also see a graph of your monthly resource usage and recommended spend limit on the [**Edit cluster**](serverless-cluster-management.html#edit-your-spend-limit) page.

To estimate the RU consumption of individual SQL statements, you can use the [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](explain-analyze.html) SQL statement. For an example, see [Example Request Unit calculation](optimize-serverless-workload.html#example-request-unit-calculation).
