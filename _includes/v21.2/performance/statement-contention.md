Find the transactions and statements within the transactions that are experiencing contention. CockroachDB has several tools to help you track down such transactions and statements:

* In DB Console, visit the [Transactions](ui-transactions-page.html) and [Statements](ui-statements-page.html) pages and sort transactions and statements by contention.
* Query the `crdb_internal.cluster_contended_indexes` and `crdb_internal.cluster_contended_tables` tables for your database to find the indexes and tables that are experiencing contention.

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM movr.crdb_internal.cluster_contended_indexes;
    ~~~

    {% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
    ~~~ sql
    > SELECT * FROM movr.crdb_internal.cluster_contended_tables;
    ~~~

After you identify the transactions or statements that are causing contention, follow the steps in the next section [to avoid contention](performance-best-practices-overview.html#avoid-transaction-contention).
