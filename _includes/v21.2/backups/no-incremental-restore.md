When you restore from an incremental backup, you're restoring the **entire** table, database, or cluster. CockroachDB uses both the latest (or a [specific](restore.html#restore-a-specific-backup)) incremental backup and the full backup during this process. You cannot restore an incremental backup without a full backup. Furthermore, it is not possible to restore over a [table](restore.html#tables), [database](restore.html#databases), or [cluster](restore.html#full-cluster) with existing data. See [Restore types](restore.html#restore-types) for detail on the types of backups you can restore.
