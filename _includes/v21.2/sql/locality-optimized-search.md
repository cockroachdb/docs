Note that the [SQL engine](../v21.2/architecture/sql-layer.html) will avoid sending requests to nodes in other regions when it can instead read a value from a unique column that is stored locally. This capability is known as [_locality optimized search_](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters).
