{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}A bug that could trigger range splits in a tight loop was discovered in this release, so this release has been withdrawn.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180122-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Removed the obsolete `kv.gc.batch_size` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html). [#21070](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21070)
- Removed the `COCKROACH_METRICS_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` environment variable. Users that relied on it should reduce the value for the `timeseries.resolution_10s.storage_duration` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) instead. [#20810](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20810)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180122-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now proactively rebalances data when the diversity of the localities that a given range is located on can be improved. [#19489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19489)
- Clusters are now initialized with default `.meta` and `.liveness` replication zones with lower GC TTL configurations. [#17628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17628)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180122-build-changes">Build Changes</h3>

- The build system now enforces a minimum version of Go, rather than enforcing a specific version of Go. Since the Go 1.x series has strict backward-compatibility guarantees, the old rule was unnecessarily restrictive. [#21426]

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180122-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- The new `SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE` statement shows the [`CREATE SEQUENCE`](../v2.0/create-sequence.html) statement that would create a carbon copy of the specified sequence. [#21208](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21208)
- The [`DROP COLUMN`](../v2.0/drop-column.html) statement now drops [`CHECK`](../v2.0/check.html) constraints. [#21203](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21203)

- `ON UPDATE CASCADE` foreign key constraints are now fully supported [#21329]
- For improved troubleshooting, more complete and useful details are now reported to clients when SQL errors are encountered. [#19793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19793)
- The new `SHOW SYNTAX` statement allows clients to analyze arbitrary SQL syntax server-side and retrieve either the (pretty-printed) syntax decomposition of the string or the details of the syntax error, if any. This statement is intended for use in the CockroachDB interactive SQL shell. [#19793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19793)
- Enhanced type checking of subqueries in order to generalize subquery support. As a side-effect, fixed a crash with subquery edge cases such as `SELECT (SELECT (1, 2)) IN (SELECT (1, 2))`. [#21076](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21076)
- Single-use common table expressions are now supported. [#20359](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20359)
- Statement sources with no output columns are now disallowed. [#20998](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20998)
- `WHERE` predicates that simplify to `NULL` no longer performs table scans. [#21067](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21067)

- The `sql_safe_updates` session variable now defaults to `false` unless the shell is truly interactive (using `cockroach sql`, `-e` not specified, standard input not redirected) and `--unsafe-updates` is not specified. Previously, `sql_safe_updates` would always default to `true` unless `--unsafe-updates` was specified. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- The `errexit` client-side option now defaults to `false` only if the shell is truly interactive, not only when the input is not redirected as previously. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- The `display_format` client-side option now defaults to `pretty` in every case where the output goes to a terminal, not only when the input is not redirected as previously. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- The `check_syntax` and `smart_prompt` client-side options, together with the interactive line editor, are only enabled if the session is interactive and output goes to a terminal. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)

- Multiplication between [`INTERVAL`](../v2.0/interval.html) and [`FLOAT`](../v2.0/float.html) values, and between `INTERVAL` and [`DECIMAL`](../v2.0/decimal.html) values, is now fully supported. [#21292]
- Reduced the size of entries stored in the `system.rangelog` table by not storing empty JSON fields. [#21318]
- The `ALTER TABLE SCATTER` statement now randomizes the locations of the leases for all ranges in the referenced table or index. [#21431]
- When using HTTPS storage for [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html), a custom CA for HTTPS storage providers can now be specified via the `cloudstorage.http.custom_ca` cluster setting. This is also used when accessing custom s3 export storage endpoints. [#21358] [#21404]
- Storage of timeseries data within the cluster can be disabled by setting the new `timeseries.storage.enabled` cluster setting to false. This is recommended only if you exclusively use a third-party tool such as Prometheus for timeseries monitoring. See this [FAQ](../v2.0/operational-faqs.html#can-i-reduce-or-disable-the-storage-of-timeseries-data-new-in-v2-0) for more details. [#21314]

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180122-command-line-changes">Command-Line Changes</h3>

- Client `cockroach` commands that use SQL (`cockroach sql`, `cockroach node ls`, etc.) now print a warning if the server is running an older version of CockroachDB than the client. Also, this and other warning messages are now clearly indicated with the "warning:" prefix. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- Client-side syntax checking performed by [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) when the `check_syntax` option is enabled has been enhanced for forward-compatibility with later CockroachDB versions. [#21119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21119)

- The `--unsafe-updates` of `cockroach sql` was renamed to `--safe-updates`. The default behavior is unchanged: The previous flag defaulted to `false`; the new flag defaults to `true`. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- The `cockroach sql` command no longer fails when the server is running a version of CockroachDB that does not support the sql_safe_updates session variable. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180122-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- Fixed tuple equality to evaluate correctly in the presence of `NULL` elements. [#21230](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21230)
- Fixed a bug where the temporary directory was being wiped on failed CockroachDB restart, causing importing and DistSQL queries to fail. [#20854](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20854)
- The "JSON" column in the output of `EXPLAIN(DISTSQL)` is now properly hidden by default. It can be shown using `SELECT *, JSON FROM [EXPLAIN(DISTSQL) ...]`. [#21154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21154)
- `EXPLAIN` queries with placeholders no longer panic. [#21168](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21168)

- Fixed a bug where non-matching interleaved rows were being inner-joined with their parent rows. [#20938](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20938)
- Fixed an issue where seemingly irrelevant error messages were being returned for certain `INSERT` statements. [#20841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20841)
- Crash details are now properly copied to the log file even when a node was started with `--logtostderr` as well as in other circumstances when crash details could be lost previously. [#20839](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20839)
- It is no longer possible to log in as a non-existent user in insecure mode. [#20800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20800)

- Fixed a scenario where a range that is too big to snapshot can lose availability even with a majority of nodes alive. [#20589](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20589)
- Fixed `BETWEEN SYMMETRIC`, which was incorrectly considered an alias for `BETWEEN`. Per the SQL99 specification, `BETWEEN SYMMETRIC` is like `BETWEEN`, except that its arguments are automatically swapped if they would specify an empty range. [#20747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20747)
