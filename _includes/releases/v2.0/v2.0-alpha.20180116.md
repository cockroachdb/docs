<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180116-backwards-incompatible-changes">Backwards-Incompatible Changes</h3>

- Removed the obsolete `kv.gc.batch_size` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html). [#21070](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21070)
- Removed the `COCKROACH_METRICS_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` environment variable. Users that relied on it should reduce the value for the `timeseries.resolution_10s.storage_duration` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) instead. [#20810](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20810)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180116-general-changes">General Changes</h3>

- For improved troubleshooting, more complete and useful details are now reported to clients when SQL errors are encountered. [#19793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19793)
- The new `SHOW SYNTAX` statement allows clients to analyze arbitrary SQL syntax server-side and retrieve either the (pretty-printed) syntax decomposition of the string or the details of the syntax error, if any. This statement is intended for use in the CockroachDB interactive SQL shell. [#19793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19793)
- Enhanced type checking of subqueries in order to generalize subquery support. As a side-effect, fixed a crash with subquery edge cases such as `SELECT (SELECT (1, 2)) IN (SELECT (1, 2))`. [#21076](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21076)
- Single-use common table expressions are now supported. [#20359](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20359)

- The `check_syntax` and `smart_prompt` client-side options, together with the interactive line editor, are only enabled if the session is interactive and output goes to a terminal. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)

- For compatibility with PostgreSQL and related tools:
    - Parsing of the `COMMENT ON` syntax is now allowed. [#21063](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21063)

- Client `cockroach` commands that use SQL (`cockroach sql`, `cockroach node ls`, etc.) now print a warning if the server is running an older version of CockroachDB than the client. Also, this and other warning messages are now clearly indicated with the "warning:" prefix. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- Client-side syntax checking performed by [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) when the `check_syntax` option is enabled has been enhanced for forward-compatibility with later CockroachDB versions. [#21119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21119)
- The `?` [client-side command](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#sql-shell-commands) of `cockroach sql` now prints out a description of each option. [#21119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21119)
- The `--unsafe-updates` of `cockroach sql` was renamed to `--safe-updates`. The default behavior is unchanged: The previous flag defaulted to `false`; the new flag defaults to `true`. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- The `cockroach sql` command no longer fails when the server is running a version of CockroachDB that does not support the sql_safe_updates session variable. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180116-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

<h3 id="v2-0-alpha-20180116-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

- Fixed the `debug compact` command to compact all sstables. [#21293](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21293)
- Fixed tuple equality to evaluate correctly in the presence of NULL elements. [#21230](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21230)
- Fixed a bug where the temporary directory was being wiped on failed CockroachDB restart, causing importing and DistSQL queries to fail. [#20854](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20854)
- The "JSON" column in the output of `EXPLAIN(DISTSQL)` is now properly hidden by default. It can be shown using `SELECT *, JSON FROM [EXPLAIN(DISTSQL) ...]`. [#21154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21154)
- `EXPLAIN` queries with placeholders no longer panic. [#21168](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21168)
- The `--safe-updates` flag of `cockroach sql` can now be used effectively in non-interactive sessions. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- Fixed a bug where non-matching interleaved rows were being inner-joined with their parent rows. [#20938](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20938)
- Fixed an issue where seemingly irrelevant error messages were being returned for certain `INSERT` statements. [#20841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20841)
- Crash details are now properly copied to the log file even when a node was started with `--logtostderr` as well as in other circumstances when crash details could be lost previously. [#20839](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20839)
- It is no longer possible to log in as a non-existent user in insecure mode. [#20800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20800)
- The `BIGINT` type alias is now correctly shown when using `SHOW CREATE TABLE`. [#20798](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20798)

Per the SQL99 specification, `BETWEEN SYMMETRIC` is like `BETWEEN`, except that its arguments are automatically swapped if they would specify an empty range. [#20747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20747)
- Fixed a replica corruption that could occur if a process crashed in the middle of a range split. [#20704](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20704)

- Dangling intents are now eagerly cleaned up when `AmbiguousResultErrors` are seen. [#20628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20628)
- Fixed the return type signature of the JSON `#>>` operator and `array_positions()` built-in function. [#20524](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20524)
- Fixed an issue where escaped characters like `A` and `\` in `LIKE`/`ILIKE` patterns were not handled properly. [#20600](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20600)
- Fixed an issue with `(NOT) (I)LIKE` pattern matching on `_...%` and `%..._` returning incorrect results. [#20600](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20600)
- Fixed a small spelling bug that made it such that a `DOUBLE PRECISION` specified type would erroneously display as a float. [#20727](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20727)
- Fixed a crash caused by null collated strings. [#20637](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20637)
