### SQL Language Changes

- For compatibility with PostgreSQL, the `transaction isolation level`, `transaction priority`, and `transaction status` [session variables](../v1.1/set-vars.html) have been renamed `transaction_isolation`, `transaction_priority`, and `transaction_status`. [#20301](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20301)
- The [`IMPORT`](../v1.1/import.html) statement now supports `201` and `204` return codes from HTTP storage. [#20516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20516)

### Command-Line Changes

- Client [`cockroach` commands](../v1.1/cockroach-commands.html) that use SQL (`cockroach sql`, `cockroach node ls`, etc.) now print a warning if the server is running an older version of CockroachDB than the client. Also, this and other warning messages are now clearly indicated with the "warning:" prefix. [#20945](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20945)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) command no longer fails when the server is running a version of CockroachDB that does not support the `sql_safe_updates` [session variable](../v1.1/set-vars.html#supported-variables). [#20945](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20945)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) command now performs client-side syntax checking automatically only if the client and server are running the same version of CockroachDB. This restriction will be lifted in CockroachDB v2.0. [#21135](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21135)
- Reduced temporary disk space usage for the `debug compact` command. [#20502](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20502)

### Bug Fixes

- Improved rebalancing to make thrashing back and forth between nodes much less likely, including when [localities](../v1.1/start-a-node.html#locality) have very different numbers of nodes. [#20934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20934)
- Fixed a scenario where a range that is too big to snapshot can lose availability even with a majority of nodes alive. [#20906](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20906)
- Fixed a replica corruption that could occur if a process crashed in the middle of a range split. [#20939](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20939)
- Fixed an issue where seemingly irrelevant error messages were being returned for certain [`INSERT`](../v1.1/insert.html) statements.[#20855](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20855)
- Crash details are now properly copied to the log file even when a node was started with `--logtostderr` as well as in other circumstances when crash details could be lost previously. [#20842](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20842)
- Fixed an issue where wildcards (`_`, `%`) and `\` escaped characters in `LIKE` patterns were not handled properly. [#20654](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20654)
- Fixed the return type signature of the `array_positions()` [built-in function](../v1.1/functions-and-operators.html). This caused a crash if the function was used in query execution by the distributed execution engine. [#20652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20652)
- Fixed a crash caused by null [collated strings](../v1.1/collate.html). [#20648](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20648)
- Fixed a crash caused by `NATURAL JOINS` and `USING` in conjunction with a filter. [#20582](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20582)
- Fixed build when new versions of `libgtest` are installed. [#20598](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20598)
- Fixed a crash caused by an edge-case when queries are run against a table undergoing a schema change. [#20541](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20541)
- Fixed a race condition that would result in some queries hanging after [cancellation](../v1.1/cancel-query.html). [#20534](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20534)
- Fixed a crash caused by some corner-case queries containing `ORDER BY`. [#20512](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20512)
- Prevented generating empty sstables at the [storage layer](../v1.1/architecture/storage-layer.html), which could cause corruption. [#20284](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20284)
- Fixed a crash caused by [`cockroach dump`](../v1.1/sql-dump.html) in the presence of reference cycles. [#20283](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20283)
- It is no longer possible to use conflicting `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clauses in different parts of a query. [#20286](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20286)
- Improved S3 resiliency during [`BACKUP`](../v1.1/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v1.1/restore.html)/[`IMPORT`](../v1.1/import.html). [#21003](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21003)

### Performance Improvements

- Improved garbage collection of very large [transactions](../v1.1/transactions.html) and large volumes of abandoned write intents. [#20446](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20446)

### Enterprise Edition Changes

- [`BACKUP`](../v1.1/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v1.1/restore.html) jobs now support `201` and `204` return codes from HTTP storage. [#20516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20516)

### Doc Updates

- Improved the [initial steps for troubleshooting a problem](../v1.1/troubleshooting-overview.html), and added a list of [common errors with recommended solutions](../v1.1/common-errors.html). [#2311](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2311)
- Updated docs styling to increase information density. [#2304](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2304)
- Documented how to [request and set trial and enterprise license keys for CockroachDB](../v1.1/enterprise-licensing.html). [#2278](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2278)
- Fixed the placement of `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` in enterprise [`BACKUP` examples](../v1.1/backup.html#examples). [#2324](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2324)
- Updated the [secure Kubernetes](../v1.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) tutorial with RBAC support. [#2281](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2281)
