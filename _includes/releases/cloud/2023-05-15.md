In addition to many of the Feature Highlights in the [CockroachDB v23.1.0 Release Notes](v23.1.html#v23-1-0), the following features are specifically available to Cloud clusters once they are upgraded:

<h3> General changes </h3>

- {{ site.data.products.serverless }} multi-region is now publicly available in [preview](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/cockroachdb-feature-availability.html#feature-availability-phases). Multi-region benefits like reduced latency and high availability are now achievable in conjunction with the ease-of-operation and automatic scaling advantages of the {{ site.data.products.serverless }} deployment model.
    
    - [Regions available](../cockroachcloud/serverless-faqs.html#what-regions-are-available-for-cockroachdb-serverless-clusters): 6 regions in AWS and 6 regions in GCP.
    - A primary region for the cluster is specified upon creation.
    - The clusterâ€™s regional configuration applies to all databases by default, so it is not necessary to run [`ALTER DATABASE`](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/alter-database.html) to configure regions when adding a database to the cluster.
    - [`SURVIVE REGION FAILURE`](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/alter-database.html#survive-zone-region-failure) is supported to achieve [region-level survival goals](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/multiregion-overview.html#survival-goals).

<h3> Console changes </h3>

- {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users can now [restore clusters from the Cloud console](../cockroachcloud/take-and-restore-customer-owned-backups.html).
