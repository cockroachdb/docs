<h3>Console changes</h3>

- The [**Connect to your cluster**](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/connect-to-the-database.html) dialog now includes code snippets for [supported languages and tools](../{{site.current_cloud_version}}/third-party-database-tools.html).
- The [**Connect to your cluster**](../cockroachcloud/connect-to-a-serverless-cluster.html) dialog for clusters running CockroachDB [v22.1](v22.1.html) now loads more quickly.
- If users log in using an [SSO](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-sso.html) method other than the one they have used previously, they will now be asked if they want to switch to the new login method.
- Previously, {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} users could only choose storage amounts within the [recommendations](../cockroachcloud/plan-your-cluster.html?filters=dedicated) for the selected machine size. Now, a warning message will appear if the storage is outside the recommended range, but any storage option can be selected.
- The date and time selection on the [**Statements**](../cockroachcloud/statements-page.html) and [**Transactions**](../cockroachcloud/transactions-page.html) pages now defaults to UTC and has an improved design.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- The [**Statements** page](../cockroachcloud/statements-page.html) no longer crashes when a search term contains `*`.
