<h3>General changes</h3>

- New CockroachCloud clusters will now run CockroachDB [v21.1.1](v21.1.html#v21-1-1).

<h3>Console changes</h3>

- All CockroachCloud Dedicated users now have access to the [**Statements**](../cockroachcloud/statements-page.html) and [**Sessions**](../cockroachcloud/sessions-page.html) pages in the Console.
- All CockroachCloud Dedicated users now have access to the [**Alerts**](../cockroachcloud/alerts-page.html) page in the Console, which allows you to toggle alerts, send test alerts, and manage alert recipients for your Organization.
- Previously, users were getting stuck during the verification step of creating an [AWS PrivateLink](../cockroachcloud/network-authorization.html#aws-privatelink) endpoint. Now, users can enter the verification step of the **Add Endpoint Connection** dialog with an incomplete connection endpoint ID preset.
- Added a **Cloud** column to the **Clusters** page so users can see which cloud provider any cluster is using without having to click through to the **Cluster Overview** page.
- The maximum number of nodes in a cluster created through the Console was raised to 50 nodes per region and 150 nodes per cluster.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where clicking the **Logout** button would trigger an error and display a blank page.
- The page will no longer refresh after switching the authentication method through the **Account** page.
- Switching organizations will no longer log you out of all sessions.
