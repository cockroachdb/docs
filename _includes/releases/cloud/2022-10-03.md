<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- The {{ site.data.products.db }} Console now utilizes the same [cluster setting](../stable/cluster-settings.html) as the DB Console, `sql.index_recommendation.drop_unused_duration`, as a threshold value for dropping unused indexes.
- Fixed a bug where [AWS PrivateLink](../cockroachcloud/network-authorization.html#aws-privatelink) endpoints could fail to create but display an error message that said they were still creating.
