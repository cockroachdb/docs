<h3> Security updates </h3>

- [Private Clusters](/docs/cockroachcloud/private-clusters.html) are now generally available for {{ site.data.products.dedicated }}. A private cluster's nodes have no public IP addresses.
- [Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)](/docs/cockroachcloud/cmek.html) is now generally available for {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} private clusters. CMEK allows you to protect data at rest in a {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} cluster using a cryptographic key that is entirely within your control, hosted in a supported cloud provider key-management system (KMS).
