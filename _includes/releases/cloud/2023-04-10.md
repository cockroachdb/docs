<h3> General changes </h3>

- Contract customers can now [create {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} advanced clusters](../cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.html#step-1-start-the-cluster-creation-process), which have all the features of {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} standard clusters, plus security features needed for [PCI compliance](../cockroachcloud/pci-dss.html). To upgrade your organization to a contract, [contact us](https://cockroachlabs.com/contact-sales)
- {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} [third party metrics integrations](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/third-party-monitoring-tools.html) (Datadog and Amazon CloudWatch) will now [export the following metrics](../cockroachcloud/export-metrics.html) to third party targets:
  - `storage_l0_sublevels`
  - `storage_l0_num_files`
  - `security_certificate_expiration_ca`
  - `sql_mem_root_current`
  - `sys_host_disk_iopsinprogress`
  
<h3> Cloud API changes </h3>

- [Cloud API](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html) users can now upgrade their cluster's [CockroachDB version](index.html), as well as roll back or manually finalize pending upgrades.
- The [Cloud API endpoints](../cockroachcloud/cloud-api.html) for managing metric export configurations have been replaced with endpoints specific to the third party tool being used. For example, `EnableMetricExport` is now replaced by `EnableDatadogMetricExport` and `EnableCloudWatchMetricExport`.

<h3> Security updates </h3>

- [Admins](../cockroachcloud/console-access-management.html#console-admin) of organizations that have [enabled SSO](../cockroachcloud/cloud-org-sso.html) can now reset the passwords of other users in their organization.

<h3> Bug fixes </h3>

- Fixed a bug where certain pages in the console would give a `404` error when navigating to the **Clusters** page.
- Removed an unnecessary warning that could appear when downloading CA certificates for {{ site.data.products.serverless }} clusters.
