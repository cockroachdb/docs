<h3>General changes</h3>

New CockroachCloud clusters will now run CockroachDB [v20.2.7](v20.2.html#v20-2-7).

<h3>Console changes</h3>

- The [login form](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/login) no longer focuses on the email field on page load. This change makes the form more flexible once other authentication methods are available.
- Extraneous information is no longer displayed in the error for failed [GCP peering](../cockroachcloud/network-authorization.html#vpc-peering) attempts.
- Added a resource panel to the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud), which can be accessed by clicking the **?** icon in the top right corner of the Console. Included in the resource panel are links to relevant documentation, Cockroach University, the CockroachDB Slack community, and much more.
- Created a new [Status Page](https://status.cockroachlabs.cloud) that displays the current service status and incident communication of the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud), AWS services, and GCP services.

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

- The region shown in the [{{ site.data.products.db }} Console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud) for free-tier clusters is now correct. Previously, the Console showed the wrong region when creating an AWS free-tier cluster.
- Fixed a bug where an error occurred when displaying the **Connect** modal for an old GCP cluster that does not have the custom `crdb` network. These clusters do not support VPC peering, but the lack of the `crdb` network was causing the listing of VPC peerings to fail even though no such peerings exist.
