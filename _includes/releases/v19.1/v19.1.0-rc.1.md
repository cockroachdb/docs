Release Date: {{ include.release_date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

In addition to bug fixes and various enterprise, SQL, and Admin UI enhancements, with this release, we also want to highlight the following feature:

- [**Prefer the nearest secondary index**](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#preferring-the-nearest-index): Given multiple identical [indexes](../v19.1/indexes.html) that have different locality constraints using [replication zones](../v19.1/configure-replication-zones.html), the cost-based optimizer will now prefer the index that is closest to the gateway node that is planning the query. In a properly configured geo-distributed cluster, this can lead to performance improvements due to improved data locality and reduced network traffic. This feature enables scenarios where reference data such as a table of postal codes can be replicated to different regions, and queries will use the copy in the same region.
- [**Encryption at Rest**](../v19.1/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise): This feature, which provides transparent encryption of a node's data on the local disk, was introduced as an experimental in CockroachDB v2.1. With this release, it is no longer considered experimental and is ready for production use.

<h3 id="v19-1-0-rc.1-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) now support TLS connections to Kafka. [#35510][#35510]
- `CHANGEFEED`s now support SASL/PLAIN authentication when connecting to a Kafka sink. [#35800][#35800]
- `CHANGEFEED`s using Kafka now log information to help debug connection issues. [#35661][#35661]

<h3 id="v19-1-0-rc.1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [cost-based optimizer](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) now picks lookup-joins less frequently. [#35561][#35561]
- CockroachDB now reports uses of [CTEs](../v19.1/common-table-expressions.html) (`WITH ...`) and [subqueries](../v19.1/subqueries.html) in [diagnostics reporting](../v19.1/diagnostics-reporting.html), to guide future product planning. [#35650][#35650]
- It is now possible to specify a `HASH` / `MERGE` / `LOOKUP` [join hint](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#join-hints) with cross joins (`CROSS <hint> JOIN`). [#35700][#35700]
- The output of [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.1/explain.html) now uses `hash-join` or `merge-join` instead of `join`. [#35688][#35688]
- Added an `EXPLAIN (opt, env)` option, which provides all relevant information for the planning of a query. [#35802][#35802]
- `transaction deadline exceeded` errors are now returned to the client with a retryable code. [#35284][#35284]
- Regular SQL errors that indicate erroneous SQL and for which CockroachDB does not yet populate a well-defined PostgreSQL error code will now be reported with code `XXUUU` instead of code `XX000`. [#35896][#35896] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Removed "experimental" from the names of the two existing automatic statistics [cluster settings](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html), and added two new cluster settings to control the target number of stale rows per table that will trigger a statistics refresh. [#36085][#36085] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Renamed the `experimental_reorder_joins_limit` [session variable](../v19.1/set-vars.html) to `reorder_joins_limit`. [#36085][#36085] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Changed [`SHOW JOBS`](../v19.1/show-jobs.html) to no longer display automatic statistics jobs. `SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS` can now be used instead to view automatic statistics jobs. [#36112][#36112] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [cost-based optimizer](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) will now try to select the index having a leaseholder preference that is closest. [#36123][#36123] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [Computed columns](../v19.1/computed-columns.html) are now evaluated after rounding any decimal values in input columns. [#36128][#36128]
- Changed the generation algorithm for the OID column of tables in `pg_catalog`. As with previous CockroachDB releases, we guarantee that the OID values are consistent between `pg_catalog` tables (so that tables can be joined together), but we do not guarantee that they are stable across CockroachDB versions. Avoid storing them in client apps. [#33697][#33697]

<h3 id="v19-1-0-rc.1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The output of [`cockroach debug zip`](../v19.1/debug-zip.html) now contains more information. [#36026][#36026] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-1-0-rc.1-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI changes</h3>

- Improved progress reporting for `CREATE STATISTICS` jobs. [#35684][#35684]
- The **Queries per second** metric in the **Summary** bar now summarizes only the query types displayed in the **SQL Queries** graph and **Node Map**. [#35905][#35905] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The **Jobs** screen no longer shows automatic statistics by default. To see these jobs, you must now select **Auto-Statistics Creation** from the **Type** menu. [#36112][#36112]
