<h3 id="v19-1-8-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Previous versions of CockroachDB were incorrectly enabling non-admin SQL users to use the [statements details](../v19.1/admin-ui-statements-page.html) in the Admin UI and the HTTP endpoint `/_status/statements`. This information is sensitive because the endpoint does not hide data that the requester does not have privilege over. This has been corrected by requiring a [SQL `admin` user](../v19.1/authorization.html) to access the statements details page and the HTTP endpoint. [#44355][#44355]

<h3 id="v19-1-8-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI changes</h3>

- We previously introduced a fix on the admin UI to prevent non-admin SQL users from executing queries - however, this accidentally made certain pages requiring table details not to display. This error has now been fixed. [#44193][#44193]

<h3 id="v19-1-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where repeated use of [`COPY FROM PARENT`](../v19.1/configure-replication-zones.html#replication-zone-variables) on an index or partition could cause an unexpected validation error. [#44266][#44266]
- Fixed a planning bug related to [`FULL` joins](../v19.1/joins.html#full-outer-joins) between single-row relations. [#44242][#44242]
- Fixed incorrect plans in very rare cases involving filters that aren't constant folded in the optimizer but that can be evaluated statically when running a given query. [#44602][#44602]
- Fixed "no output column equivalent to.." and "column not in input" errors in some cases involving [`DISTINCT ON`](../v19.1/select-clause.html#eliminate-duplicate-rows) and [`ORDER BY`](../v19.1/query-order.html). [#44598][#44598]
- Fixed "expected constant FD to be strict" internal error. [#44599][#44599]
- Fixed a bug where running a query with the [`LIKE`](../v19.1/functions-and-operators.html) operator using the custom `ESCAPE` symbol when the pattern contained Unicode characters could result in an internal error in CockroachDB. [#44649][#44649]
- Fixed possibly incorrect query results in various cornercases, especially when [`SELECT DISTINCT`](../v19.1/select-clause.html#eliminate-duplicate-rows) is used. [#44606][#44606]
- Fixed an internal error that could happen in the planner when table statistics were collected manually using [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v19.1/create-statistics.html) for different columns at different times. [#44443][#44443]
- CockroachDB no longer repeatedly looks for non-existing jobs, which may cause  high memory usage, when cleaning up schema changes. [#44824][#44824]
