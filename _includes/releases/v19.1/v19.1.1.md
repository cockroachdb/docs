### Enterprise edition changes

- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) now accept a `key_in_value` option; this is automatically used for cloud storage sinks, making the primary key of deleted rows recoverable. [#37328][#37328] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- `EXPLAIN (DISTSQL) CREATE STATISTICS` now shows the DistSQL plan used by the [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v19.1/create-statistics.html) job. [#37237][#37237] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added missing columns to [`information_schema.columns`](../v19.1/information-schema.html). [#37283][#37283] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- Prevented panics when adding [comments](../v19.1/comment-on.html) to database objects at high verbosity. [#37325][#37325]
- Fixed panics when trying to run certain `SHOW` commands via the pgwire prepare path. [#37325][#37325]
- Fixed a regression in 19.1 that prevented empty arrays from being accepted over pgwire. [#37398][#37398]
- While a cluster is unavailable (e.g., during a network partition), memory and goroutines used for authenticating connections no longer leak when the client closes said connections. [#36177][#36177]
- Fixed a possible panic while recovering from a WAL on which a sync operation failed. [#37109][#37109]
- Fixed an error which could occur when a zigzag join was performed against a table with dropped columns. [#37245][#37245]
- Fixed incorrect query plans/results when non-validated FK constraints are not satisfied by the data. [#37253][#37253]
- `CHANGEFEED`s now retry instead of causing errors in more situations. [#37092][#37092]
- Fixed a bug where `CHANGEFEED` job progress would regress when the job was restarted. [#37091][#37091]
- The `changefeed.max_behind_nanos` metric now has fewer false positives of changefeeds falling behind. [#37048][#37048]
- Corrected the names of some columns for tables created with [`CREATE TABLE <name> AS <query>`](../v19.1/create-table-as.html). [#37238][#37238]
- Fixed a bug causing unvalidated check constraints to disappear from the output of [`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`](../v19.1/show-constraints.html) and to not be referenced in [`ALTER TABLE`](../v19.1/alter-table.html) after upgrading to 19.1. [#37462][#37462]

### Performance improvements

- Improved the performance of some queries containing predicates with constant functions, since these functions are now evaluated earlier during query optimization. [#37234][#37234]
- Improved the performance of some queries by teaching the optimizer to always prefer constrained scans over unconstrained scans. [#37235][#37235]

### Doc updates

- Updated the [Kubernetes tutorials](../v19.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) for running CockroachDB on GKE to specify a reasonable machine type. Also updated the Helm-specific instructions for maintenance tasks (adding/removing nodes, upgrading a cluster).[#4813](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4813) [#4805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4805)
- Fixed the code sample in [Build a PHP App with CockroachDB](../v19.1/build-a-php-app-with-cockroachdb.html) to not create new connections for each query. [#4804](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4804).
