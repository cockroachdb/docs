Release Date: {{ include.release_date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

In addition to bug fixes and various general, enterprise, SQL, and Admin UI enhancements, this release includes several major highlights:

- [**Managed CockroachDB Console**](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/): Paid managed CockroachDB customers can now sign into their organization's account, view the connection string details, add and edit thier list of allowed IPs on the management console.
- [**GSSAPI with Kerberos Authentication**](../v19.1/gssapi_authentication.html): CockroachDB now supports the Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) with Kerberos authentication, which lets you use an external enterprise directory system that supports Kerberos, such as Active Directory. This feature requires an [Enterprise License](../v19.1/enterprise-licensing.html).
- [**Query Optimizer Hints**](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#join-hints): The cost-based optimizer now supports hint syntax to force the use of a merge, hash, or lookup join. This let you override the cost-based optimizer's join algorithm selection in cases where you have information about your data that the cost-based optimizer does not yet have.
- [**Correlated Subqueries**](../v19.1/subqueries.html#correlated-subqueries): Most correlated subqueries are decorrelated and processed by the cost-based-optimizer. However, for those that cannot be decorrelated, CockroachDB now emits an "apply" operator that executes a sub-plan for every row in its input. This allows CockroachDB to execute a large number of additional correlated subqueries that were not able to be executed in v2.1.

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- The [cluster settings](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html) `timeseries.storage.10s_resolution_ttl` and `timeseries.storage.30m_resolution_ttl` have been renamed to `timeseries.storage.resolution_10s.ttl` and `timeseries.storage.resolution_30m.ttl` for ease of use in SQL clients. Any value set using the previous setting name in existing clusters is migrated over to the new name; subsequent changes using the old name will be ignored. [#34248][#34248] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Added the `debug encryption-active-key` command. [#35234][#35234]
- The `changefeed.min_high_water` metric has been deprecated in favor of `changefeed.max_behind_nanos`, which is easier to alert on. The **Changefeed** dashboard in the Admin UI now contains a graph of this metric. [#35257][#35257] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `rocksdb.encryption.algorithm` per-store metric, which describes the encryption cipher in use. [#35506][#35506]
- In exchange for increased correctness confidence, [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) using `changefeed.push.enabled` (the default) now take slightly more resources on startup and range rebalancing/splits. [#35470][#35470]

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Changed the default set of column statistics created by [CREATE STATISTICS](../v19.1/create-statistics.html) to include up to 100 regular table columns in addition to all indexed columns. [#35192][#35192] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the ability to pause all automatic statistics jobs by pausing the currently running job. [#35243][#35243] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Automatic statistics are now enabled by default. [#35291][#35291] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now supports many more correlated subqueries. [#34546][#34546]
- Schema changes now trigger automatic statistics collection for the affected table. [#35252][#35252] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `pg_catalog.current_setting()` and `pg_catalog.set_config()` [built-in functions](../v19.1/functions-and-operators.html) are now supported for compatibility with PostgreSQL. Note that only session-scoped configuration changes remain supported (`set_config(_, _, false)`). [#35121][#35121] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [`RENAME COLUMN`](../v19.1/rename-column.html) command can now be used alongside other table commands in a single [`ALTER TABLE`](../v19.1/alter-table.html) statement. This makes it possible to, for example, atomically add a computed column based on an existing column, and rename the columns so that the computed column "replaces" the original column. [#35091][#35091] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now supports `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME CONSTRAINT`. Only indexes that are not depended on by views can be renamed. [#35091][#35091] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`SHOW JOBS`](../v19.1/show-jobs.html) now returns an extra `statement` column, which is populated when the description is not the statement. [#35439][#35439] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`SHOW QUERIES`](../v19.1/show-queries.html) and [`SHOW SESSIONS`](../v19.1/show-sessions.html) now omit internal queries and sessions by default. Use `SHOW ALL QUERIES` or `SHOW ALL SESSIONS` to include internal queries in the output. [#35504][#35504] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now starts emitting changefeed events immediately for sinkless changefeeds (an experimental feature). The `results_buffer_size` connection string parameter is no longer needed for this purpose. [#35529][#35529] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now provides usable comments with optional documentation URLs for the virtual tables in `pg_catalog`, `information_schema`, and `crdb_internal`. Use `SHOW TABLES [FROM ...] WITH COMMENT` to read. Note that `crdb_internal` tables remain an experimental feature subject to change without notice. [#34764][#34764] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now reports usage frequency of various SQL scalar operators in telemetry, when telemetry is enabled, so as to guide future optimizations of query performance. [#35616][#35616] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now reports how the [`SERIAL`](../v19.1/serial.html) pseudo-type is expanded in table column definitions, when telemetry is enabled. [#35656][#35656] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI changes</h3>

- [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v19.1/create-statistics.html) jobs no longer generate events by default. [#35425][#35425]
- Queries issued internally by CockroachDB are now displayed under a single "(internal)" application name entry in the drop-down menu on the **Statements** page. [#35503][#35503]
- Additional types of transaction restart errors are now tracked on the **Distributed** dashboard. [#35438][#35438]
- Added "Statistics Creation" as a job type on the **Jobs** page. [#35651][#35651]

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a planning bug that caused incorrect aggregation results on multi-node aggregations with implicit, partial orderings on the inputs to the aggregations. [#35221][#35221]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when evaluating certain binary expressions containing operands with different types. [#35247][#35247]
- Prevented a situation in which snapshots would be refused repeatedly over long periods of time, with error messages such as "aborting snapshot because raft log is too large" appearing in the logs, and often accompanied by under-replicated ranges in the UI. [#35136][#35136]
- [`BACKUP`](../v19.1/backup.html) to `nodelocal` now writes files atomically. [#34937][#34937]

- CockroachDB now properly reports the composite foreign key match type in `information_schema.referential_constraints`. [#35575][#35575]
- Subtracting 0 from a JSON array now correctly removes its first element. [#35617][#35617]
- Fixed a "column not in input" crash when `INSERT / UPDATE / UPSERT ... RETURNING` is used inside a clause that requires an ordering. [#35644][#35644]
- Fixed an error when executing some set operations containing only nulls in one of the input columns. [#35321][#35321]
- Fixed an on-disk inconsistency that could result from a crash during a range merge. [#35626][#35626]

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- [Go 1.11.5](https://golang.org/dl/) is now the minimum required version necessary to build CockroachDB. [#35536][#35536] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB will provisionally refuse to build with Go 1.12, as this is known to produce incorrect code inside CockroachDB. [#35638][#35638]
- Release Docker images are now built on Debian 9.8. [#35517][#35517]

<h3 id="v19-1-0-beta-20190318-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>
