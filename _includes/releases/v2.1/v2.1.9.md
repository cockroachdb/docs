### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that could lead to data inconsistencies and crashes with the message `consistency check failed with N inconsistent replicas`. [#40353][#40353]
- Fixed incorrect results, or "unordered span" errors, in some cases involving exclusive inequalities with non-numeric types. [#38897][#38897]
- Fixed a potential infinite loop in queries involving reverse scans. [#39105][#39105]
- Unary negatives in constant arithmetic expressions are no longer ignored. [#39368][#39368]
- Fix wrong comparator used in RocksDB compaction picker, which can lead to infinite compaction loop. [#40752][#40752]
- Fix bug where MVCC value at future timestamp is returned after a transaction restart. [#40632][#40632]
- Consider intents in a read's uncertainty interval to be uncertain just as if they were committed values. This removes the potential for stale reads when a causally dependent transaction runs into the not-yet resolved intents from a causal ancestor. [#40632][#40632]
