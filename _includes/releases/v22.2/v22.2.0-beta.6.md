<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-6-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when parsing malformed changefeed expressions. [#90844][#90844]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- TTL decoding error messages now correctly contain hex encoded key bytes instead of hex encoded key pretty print output. [#90726][#90726]
- Remove redundant assertion that ExportRequests should have ReturnSST.  Release justification: low risk bug fix that allows us to remove a redundant parameter from ExportRequest [#90833][#90833]
- Fix bug that resulted in some retriable errors not being retried during IMPORT. [#90429][#90429]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect results and internal errors when a `LEFT JOIN` operated on a table with virtual computed columns. The bug only presented when the optimizer planned a "paired joiner". Only values of the virtual columns would be incorrect - they could be be `NULL` when their correct value was not `NULL`. An internal error would occur in the same situation if the virtual column had a `NOT NULL` constraint. This bug was present since version 22.1.0. [#90999][#90999]
