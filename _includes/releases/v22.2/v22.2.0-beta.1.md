<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Redacted logs now reveal pretty-printed keys, except for the index key values themselves. For example `/Table/42/1222/‹x›` is shown instead of `‹x›` (which was shown previously). This improved redaction is available for the `/Table` keyspace for both system and application tenants. Other keyspaces such as `/Meta1`, `/Meta2`, `/Local`, etc. are not yet supported. [#87647][#87647]
- The following types of data are now considered "safe" for reporting from within debug.zip:
    - Range start/end keys, which can include data from any indexed   SQL column.
    - Key spans, which can include data from any indexed SQL column
    - Usernames and role names
    - SQL object names (including database, schema, table, sequence, view, type, and UDF names)
[#88266][#88266]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Postgres-wire-level `PREPARE` statements now support the case where the number of the type hints is greater than the number of placeholders in the given query. [#88146][#88146]
- `Information_schema.role_routine_grants` is now populated properly with both built-in functions and user-defined functions. [#88233][#88233]
- The PostgreSQL compatibility function `obj_description` now supports retrieving comments on schemas. [#88263][#88263]
- The index of a placeholder is now replaced with `$1` to limit fingerprint creations. [#88365][#88365]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- `debug zip`'s `--redact-logs` flag has been deprecated in favor of the `--redact` flag, which applies to a broader scope than just logs, and also includes logs. The new `--redact` flag triggers the redaction of all sensitive data in debug zip bundles, with the exception of range keys. Range keys must remain unredacted because they are essential to support CockroachDB. The `--redact-logs` flag is still available but displays a redaction warning and is interpreted as `--redact` instead. [#88266][#88266]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- On the SQL Activity Session Details page, the Most Recent Statement section shows the last active query instead of "No Active Statement". [#88057][#88057]
- On the SQL Activity page, the **App** filter label has been renamed to **Application Name**, and the **Username** label has been renamed to **User Name**. [#88144][#88144]
- The **Transaction Execution ID** column is now shown in the **Blocked Statements** table on the Active Statement Details page. [#88135][#88135]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a problem that could cause incorrect results from queries that use locality-optimized search on the inverted index of a table with `REGIONAL BY ROW` partitioning. [#88114][#88114]
- The `pg_catalog.pg_get_viewdef` function now works properly for materialized views. [#88143][#88143]
- When restoring a cluster or tenant from a backup, only tenants that were activated during the backup are activated during the restore. [#88157][#88157]
- Fixed a problem where checking a custom sessionsetting with the `current_setting` built-in function resulted in an error if the setting was not set and the `missing_ok` argument was true. [#88158][#88158]
- Fixed a problem where `CREATE TABLE {TABLE_NAME} as (SELECT * FROM crdb_internal.check_consistency(...))` could cause a panic on the gateway node. [#88227][#88227]
- Fixed a problem where CockroachDB could not fetch rows with `NULL` values when reading from the unique secondary index when multiple column families were defined for the table and the index did not store some of the `NOT NULL` columns. [#88210][#88210]
- Fixed a problem that could cause `CHANGEFEED` to crash when running on recent Go versions. [#88231][#88231]
- On the Statement Execution Insights page, the end time of a query is now calculated based on statement execution latency, rather than the statement end time. [#88276][#88276]
- Completed statement diagnostics bundles now persist in the UI in Statement Diagnostics Bundle pages. [#88286][#88286]
- Privileges are now checked before dropping temporary tables and sequences. [#88305][#88305]
- Fixed a problem where the pgwire `DESCRIBE` step could fail with an error when attempting to look up cursors declared with names containing special characters. [#88316][#88316]
- Jobs pages now refresh data at an interval of 10 seconds. [#88285][#88285]
- Fixed a crash in `CHANGEFEED` expressions when an empty projection was encoded in JSON. [#88311][#88311]
- CockroachDB now reacts more quickly to query cancellations (such as when a statement timeout is exceeded) after a query is spilled to disk. [#88378][#88378]
