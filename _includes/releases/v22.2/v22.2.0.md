Release Date: September 22, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-0-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Changefeeds are more efficient during initial scan and backfill.  The impact on runtime GC signficantly reduced, resulting in significant reduction of the changefeed impact on the foreground SQL latency. [#87796][#87796]
- Backup/restore now can backup and restore user-defined function descriptors at database and cluster level. Release justification: necessar fix to backup/restore to make sure it works with user-defined functions. [#88023][#88023]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a creation timestamp to index usage statistics telemetry. [#87448][#87448]
- Added the schema name to index usage statistics telemetry. [#87504][#87504]
- A hint will now be provided when importing from a CSV file fails due to null values having leading or trailing whitespace or being quoted when the `allow_quoted_null` option is not set. [#87443][#87443]
- Instead of always recommending to replace the first existing index with the same explicit columns, the index recommendation now considers all existing indexes in the table to decide the best one to replace. [#87174][#87174]
- Owners of a backup schedule can now control their schedule using the supported pause, resume, drop and alter queries.  Release justification: high impact change to introduce finer grained permission control to disaster recovery operations [#87600][#87600]
- Previously, a schema can be renamed even when a child table is referenced by a view or UDF. The renaming breaks the view and UDF since tables are referenced by names in views and UDFs at the moment. This commit adds check to disallow renaming a schema if there is table references. Release justification: low risk bug fix. [#87540][#87540]
- This change adds:: - network bytes sent - maximum memory usage - maximum disk usage - KV bytes read - KV rows read - network messages fields to the `SampledQuery` telemetry log. [#87648][#87648]
- Users may now be granted the CHANGEFEED privilege on a table, allowing them to create changefeeds for that table even if they don't have the CONTROLCHANGEFEED role option or the SELECT privilege. Note that this still in effect gives them the ability to read the data in the table. Users with the CONTROLCHANGEFEED role option still need SELECT on each table, even if they also have CHANGEFEED. [#87887][#87887]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The \c metacommand no longer shows the password in plaintext.  Release justification: low risk change [#87538][#87538]
- Cockroach demo is reverted back to not run multi-tenant mode by default.  Release justification: Disabling functionality not yet ready for GA. [#87810][#87810]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed the active transaction description.Removed transaction insights details elapsed time because it is not available and was the contention time. [#87604][#87604]
- Internal sessions and active executions will only be surfaced in the UI when  the cluster setting `sql.stats.response.show_internal.enabled` is set to true. [#87608][#87608]
- Improve message when there is no insight problem detected. Now we show the statement was slow and how long it took. [#87799][#87799]
- Removal of the link on insights pointing to Statement Details page when it was already on the Statement Details page. [#87800][#87800]
- Add ability to copy the index recommendation to clipboard. [#87794][#87794]
- Fixed the index and grant sorting on the database page to have default column and to have url match the user selection. [#87832][#87832]
- Add Application Name to Statement overview, Transaction Overview (and their respective column selectors), Transaction Details. Update label from "App" to "Application Name" on Statement Details page. [#87868][#87868]
- Fixed the % of all runtime when filtered. It previously used only the filtered data to calculate the value instead of all the data in that time period. [#88027][#88027]
- Rename contention to contention time. This matches other columns like elapsed time. [#88040][#88040]
- Add insights link to all insights pages, and change schema insights message to match message on workload insights page. [#88012][#88012]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The statement bundle produced for statements that use no tables (e.g. `select 123`) now properly includes an empty `schema.sql`. [#86484][#86484]
- Some upgrade migrations perform schema changes on system tables. Those upgrades which added indexes could, in some cases, get caught retrying because they failed to detect that the migration had already occurred due to the existence of a populated field. When that happens, the finalization of the new version can hang indefinitely and require manual intervention. This bug has been fixed. [#87623][#87623]
- Fix `is_generated` in `information_schema.column` table [#87670][#87670]
- In rare cases, the value of a cluster setting could regress soon after it was set. This no longer happens for a given gateway node. [#87732][#87732]
- Ui no longer crashes when there is no text being passed to the limit text function. [#87797][#87797]
- In some scenarios, when a DROP INDEX was run around the same time as a DROP TABLE or DROP DATABASE covering the same data, the `DROP INDEX` gc job could get caught retrying indefinitely. This has been fixed. [#87721][#87721]
- A consistency check is now skipped/stopped when the collection request is canceled before/while running the check computation. Previously such checks would start and run until completion, and, due to the limited size of the worker pool, prevent the useful checks from running. [#87841][#87841]
- Consistency checks are now sent to all replicas in parallel, previously it would be blocked on processing the local replica first. This a) reduces the latency of one check 2x, and b) allows better propagation of the cancelation signal which results in fewer abandoned tasks on remote replicas, and more resources spent on useful checks. [#87841][#87841]
- This patch fixes a misused query optimization involving tables with one or more PARTITION BY clauses and partition zone constraints which assign region locality to those partitions. In some cases the optimizer picks a `locality-optimized search` query plan which is not truly locality-optimized, and has higher latency than competing query plans which use distributed scan. Locality-optimized search is now avoided in cases which are known not to benefit from this optimization.  Release justification: Low risk fix for suboptimal locality-optimized scan [#87866][#87866]
- Improved the default output when using a SELECT clause with a CHANGEFEED. [#87961][#87961]
- Scheduled backups from pre-22.2 clusters would fail on upgrade to 22.2 because they could not find the proto messages when unmarshalling the scheduled job records. [#87999][#87999]
- An active replication report update could prevent a node from shutting down until it completed. The report update is now cancelled on node shutdown instead. [#87925][#87925]
