## v22.2.0-beta.2

Release Date: October 3, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Introduced a new JWT-based authentication method as an option. This work lays the ground work for users to have SSO-based login into their {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} clusters. [#88588][#88588]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Changed the default value of `sql.metrics.statement_details.plan_collection.enabled` to `false`, since we no longer use this information anywhere. [#88416][#88416]
- The pgwire protocol implementation can now accept arguments of the JSON type (`oid=114`). Previously, it could only accept JSONB (`oid=3802`). Internally, JSON and JSONB values are still identical, so this change only affects how the values are received over the wire protocol. [#88576][#88576]
- Added the `sql.metrics.statement_details.gateway_node.enabled` [cluster setting](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/cluster-settings.html), which controls whether the gateway node ID should be persisted to the `system.statement_statistics` table as is or as a `0`, to decrease cardinality on the table. The node id is still available on the statistics column. [#88616][#88616]
- Added the `cloudstorage.gs.chunking.retry_timeout` [cluster setting](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/cluster-settings.html), which can be used to configure the per-chunk retry timeout of files to Google Cloud Storage. The default value is 60 seconds. [#87720][#87720]
- Previously [`SHOW GRANTS`](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/show-grants.html) only supported `db`, `schema`, `table` and `types`. This release adds supports for user-defined functions (UDFs), so that `SHOW GRANTS` returns a UDF's privilege info, and statements like `SHOW GRANTS ON FUNCTION <udf name/signatures>` are now supported. The full function signature must be provided if the function name is not unique. [#88866][#88866]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added two new sets of per-LSM-level time-series metrics, one for level size and another for level score. These metrics are of the form `storage.{level}-level-{size,score}`. [#88592][#88592]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The previously-experimental and undocumented `debug backup` has been removed. [#88701][#88701]
- The `debug unsafe-remove-dead-replicas` CLI command has been deprecated, and will be removed in v23.1. Users should use the new `debug recover` set of commands instead. [#88765][#88765]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Removed the "full scan" field from the **Active Transaction Details** page. [#88404][#88404]
- Added support for multiple blocking transactions on the **Insights** > **Transaction Executions** page, merged displayed cards into the table, and fixed the reported total contention time. [#88522][#88522]
- Renamed the **Insights Overview** table column "execution id" to "latest execution id". This will help avoid confusion since the UI only shows the latest ID per fingerprint. [#88591][#88591]
- The {{ site.data.products.dedicated }} Cloud Console now displays information on which transactions are blocked or waiting on the active execution pages. This includes the `Time Spent Waiting` column in the overview pages and the wait time insights panel on the details pages. This feature is currently unavailable for {{ site.data.products.serverless }}. [#88856][#88856]
- The **Statements**, **Transactions**, and **Transaction Details** pages in the DB Console now properly show the Regions/Nodes columns, as well as filters for multi-region clusters. [#88572][#88572]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB no longer fetches unnecessary rows for queries that use the [`LIMIT`](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/limit-offset.html) statement. The bug was introduced in v22.1.7. [#88417][#88417]
- Active transactions with a non-zero executed statement count now always have populated statement text, even when no statement is being executed. [#88404][#88404]
- Fixed a bug where offline tables were included in [full-cluster backups](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/backup.html#backup-a-cluster), as reported in [#88043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/88043). [#88474][#88474]
- Implemented a change to ensure that time elapsed for active transactions and statements is never negative. [#88467][#88467]
- Fixed a rare internal error with message `estimated row count must be non-zero`, which could occur during planning when a predicate included values close to the maximum or minimum `int64` value. [#88529][#88529]
- Upgraded `grpc` to v1.49.0 which fixed a few panics on nil pointers [#88630][#88630]
- Fixed missing automatic statistics collection on system tables during cluster startup. This bug only affects the v22.2.0-alpha releases. [#88689][#88689]
- A bug has been fixed that could cause nodes to crash in rare cases when executing [apply joins](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/joins.html#apply-joins) in query plans. [#88483][#88483]
- A bug has been fixed that caused errors in rare cases when executing queries with correlated [`WITH`](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/common-table-expressions.html) expressions. This bug has been present since the introduction of correlated `WITH` expressions in v21.2.0. [#88483][#88483]
- Fixed unintended recordings of index reads caused by internal executor/queries. [#88867][#88867]
- A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect evaluation of expressions in the form `col +/- const1 ? const2`, where `const1` and `const2` are constant values and `?` is any comparison operator. The bug was caused by operator overflow when the optimizer attempted to simplify these expressions to have a single constant value. [#88895][#88895]
- Adjusted sending and receiving Raft queue sizes to match. Previously the receiver could unnecessarily drop messages in situations when the sending queue is bigger than the receiving one. [#88406][#88406]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The [`SHOW BACKUP`](../{{site.versions["dev"]}}/show-backup.html) statement is now more performant when working with a backup containing several table descriptors. [#88711][#88711]
