<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in `Concat` projection operators for arrays that could cause non-`NULL` values to be added to the array when one of the arguments was `NULL`. [#89347][#89347]
- `VIEWCLUSTERMETADATA` permissions are now required to view hot ranges, problem ranges, data distribution, stores report, range status, and Raft for all ranges.  [#89509][#89509]
- Updated [`SHOW CLUSTER SETTING`](/docs/v22.2/show-cluster-setting.html) sql command to require `VIEWCLUSTERSETTING` or `MODIFYCLUSTERSETTING` permissions. [#89509][#89509]
- Fixed a visual bug on Store Report sub-pages where an error shows an infinite spinner only. [#89509][#89509]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a failed upgrade if tables created by userfile storage have invalid foreign key constraints. [#89370][#89370]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent the system from exiting a joint configuration. A `VOTER_DEMOTING_LEARNER` can now acquire the lease in a joint configuration only when there is a `VOTER_INCOMING` in the configuration and the `VOTER_DEMOTING_LEARNER` was the last leaseholder. [#89595][#89595]

- Fixed a bug, introduced in a 22.2.x alpha version, in which uncommitted privileges could be cached if a transaction is rolled back. [#89718][#89718]

- Fixed a bug introduced in a v22.2.0 beta version, that could cause queries with expressions like `'foo' LIKE col` to return incorrect values when an inverted trigram index existed on `col`. [#89701][#89701]
