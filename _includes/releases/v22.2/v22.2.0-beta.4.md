<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevented usage of profiling links on the Advanced Debug page. [#89310][#89310]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in `Concat` projection operators for arrays that could cause non-null values to be added to the array when one of the arguments was null. [#89347][#89347]
- `VIEWCLUSTERMETADATA` permissions are now required to view hot ranges, problem ranges, data distribution, stores report, range status, and Raft for all ranges.  [#89509][#89509]
- Updated `SHOW CLUSTER SETTING` sql command to require `VIEWCLUSTERSETTING` or `MODIFYCLUSTERSETTING` permissions. [#89509][#89509]
- Fixed a visual bug on stores report where an error shows an infinite spinner only. [#89509][#89509]
- Fixes tables created by userfile storage that have invalid foreign key constraints. [#89370][#89370]
- A `VOTER_DEMOTING_LEARNER` can acquire the lease in a joint configuration only when there is a `VOTOR_INCOMING` in the configuration and the `VOTER_DEMOTING_LEARNER` was the last leaseholder. This prevents a situation in which the system is unable to exit the joint configuration. [#89595][#89595]

- Fixed a bug, introduced in a 22.2.x alpha version, in which uncommitted privileges could be cached if a transaction is rolled back. For example:

    ~~~ sql
    BEGIN;
    GRANT SELECT ON crdb_internal.tables TO testuser;
    SELECT has_table_privilege('testuser', 'crdb_internal.tables', 'SELECT');
    --- this caches the privilege ---
    ROLLBACK;
    --- SELECT IS STILL CACHED UNTIL ANOTHER GRANT/REVOKE HAPPENS TO INVALIDATE THE CACHE---
    ~~~

    [#89718][#89718]

- Fixed a bug introduced in a v22.2.0 beta version, that caused queries with expressions like `'foo' LIKE col` to return incorrect values, but only when an inverted trigram index exists on `col`. [#89701][#89701]
