## v22.2.3

Release Date: January 23, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-3-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- CockroachDB no longer populates or supports the [`crdb_internal.gossip_network`](../v22.2/crdb-internal.html) table. [#94074][#94074]

<h3 id="v22-2-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Previously, error messages for missing users sometimes had different forms. This is now unified as `role/user "{user}" does not exist`. [#94735][#94735]
- It is now possible to create and [alter not visible indexes](../v22.2/alter-index.html#index-visibility) using the alias `INVISIBLE`. The alias can be used anywhere `NOT VISIBLE` is used when creating or altering indexes. Note that the `INVISIBLE` alias is **not** supported for `NOT VISIBLE` columns. [#95018][#95018]
- [`COPY`](../v22.2/copy-from.html) now logs an error during the insert phase on the [`SQL_EXEC`](../v22.2/logging.html#sql_exec) logging channel. [#95176][#95176]

<h3 id="v22-2-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- In the PostgreSQL extended protocol mode, it was possible for auto-commits to not execute logic for DDL statements, when certain DML (insert/update/delete) and DDL statements were combined in an implicit transaction. Auto-commits are now disabled inside the planner if any DDL statements were executed earlier. [#93717][#93717]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when using a SQL cursor to access tables in the [`crdb_internal`](../v22.2/crdb-internal.html) schema. [#94443][#94443]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect selectivity estimation for queries with ORed predicates all referencing a common single table. [#94664][#94664]
- Fixed a bug in join queries that involves tables with unique constraints using `LIMIT`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to ensure the [optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) considers streaming group-by with no TopK operation when possible. This is often the most efficient query plan. [#94603][#94603]
- Fixed a bug where certain [`GRANT`](../v22.2/grant.html) or [`REVOKE`](../v22.2/revoke.html) commands on a user that does not exist would error with the correct PG code. [#94735][#94735]
- Fixed a crash that occurs on the gateway node when collecting a statement diagnostics bundle (e.g., [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`](../v22.2/explain-analyze.html#explain-analyze-debug)) on a statement that fails with certain errors. This crash has existed in various forms since the introduction of statement bundles in v20.1.0. [#94869][#94869]
- Fixed a v22.1 compatibility bug in clusters with mixed v22.2/v22.1 nodes where range replica changes (moving replicas, up/down replication, splits, and merges) could sometimes fail on v22.1 leaseholders with an error of the form `"change replicas of r47 failed: descriptor changed: [expected] != [actual]"`, without showing any apparent difference between the listed descriptors. This would not affect the upgrade itself, and either continuing to upgrade all nodes to v22.2 or rolling nodes back to v22.1 (possibly with an additional restart) will resolve the issue. [#94888][#94888]
- It is now possible to run [`cockroach version`](../v22.2/cockroach-version.html) and [`cockroach start`](../v22.2/cockroach-start.html) (and possibly other sub-commands) when the user running the command does not have permission to access the current working directory. [#94927][#94927]
- Fixed a bug that caused `pg_function_is_visible` to always report that any [user-defined function](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) was visible. It now correctly uses the `search_path` to determine visibility. [#94959][#94959]
- Fixed a bug that caused an internal error occurring in `CASE` expressions when a column present in a `THEN` or `ELSE` expression is of an inequivalent type compared to that of a constant this column is compared to in an equality predicate. For example, `(CASE WHEN false THEN int_col ELSE 1 END) IN (int_col) AND int_col=3/2`. [#95178][#95178]

<h3 id="v22-2-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Significantly reduced CPU usage of the underlying gossip network in large clusters. [#94074][#94074]
- Refactored the query logic when fetching database index recommendations for the Database Details API endpoint. This greatly reduces the query time and cost, particularly for large schemas. [#94923][#94923]
