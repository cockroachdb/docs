## v22.2.0-alpha.2

Release Date: September 6, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-2-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- The [`ALTER BACKUP SCHEDULE`](../v22.2/alter-backup.html) statement will now fail if the new backup statement does not pass planning. [#86819][#86819]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added the `enforce_home_region` [session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html), which when `true` causes queries which have no home region or which may scan rows via a database connection outside of the query's home region to error out. Also, only tables in [multi-region](../v22.2/multiregion-overview.html) databases with `ZONE` [survivability](../v22.2/multiregion-overview.html#survival-goals) may be scanned without error when this setting is `true`, because ranges in an offline region may be served non-locally to the gateway region when using `REGION` survivability, and therefore cannot be guaranteed to have low latency. [#85704][#85704]
- Introduced a new `BACKUP` privilege that is grantable as a system, database or table/type/schema level privilege. You can opt-in to the new privilege model by granting the appropriate privileges as per the following model:
    1. Cluster backups - user requires the `BACKUP` [system-level privilege](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#system-level-privileges).
    1. Database backups - user requires the database `BACKUP` privilege.
    1. Table backups - user requires the table `BACKUP` privilege.
    In CockroachDB v22.2, the previous privilege model will continue to be respected, but will be completely replaced with the `BACKUP` system-level privilege in a future version of CockroachDB. [#86495][#86495]
- Added the `optimizer_use_forecasts` [session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html), which can be set to `false` to disable usage of statistics forecasts when optimizing a query. [#86834][#86834]
- Added the `json{,b}_to_record{,set}` [built-in function](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html), which transforms JSON into structured SQL records. [#82435][#82435]
- Added the `sql.stats.forecasts.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html), which controls whether statistics forecasts are generated by default for all tables. This behaves differently than the `optimizer_use_forecasts` session setting, which controls whether statistics forecasts are used when optimizing the current query. If `sql.stats.forecasts.enabled` is disabled, then even if `optimizer_use_forecasts` is `true` for a given query it won't have any forecasts to use to generate its output. [#86932][#86932]
- Added the `sql_stats_forecasts_enabled` table setting, which controls whether statistics forecasts are generated for a specific table. When set, this overrides the `sql.stats.forecasts.enabled` cluster setting. [#86986][#86986]
- Introduced a new `RESTORE` privilege that is grantable as a system or database level privilege. You can opt-in to the new privilege model by granting the appropriate privileges as per the following model:
    1. Cluster backups - user requires the `RESTORE` [system-level privilege](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#system-level-privileges).
    1. Database backups - user requires the `RESTORE` [system-level privilege](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#system-level-privileges).
    1. Table backups - user requires the database `RESTORE` privilege.
    In CockroachDB v22.2, the previous privilege model will continue to be respected, but will be completely replaced with the `RESTORE` system-level privilege in a future version of CockroachDB. [#86918][#86918]
- The [`SHOW REGIONS`](../v22.2/show-regions.html) statement now shows information about secondary regions. [#86924][#86924]
- The `SHOW SYSTEM GRANTS [FOR ROLE ...]` statement now allows you to see the grants done by `GRANT SYSTEM ...` [#86700][#86700]
- Added support for the [`SHOW GRANTS`](../v22.2/show-grants.html) syntax: `SHOW GRANTS ON EXTERNAL CONNECTION "name" FOR [users...]`. [#86700][#86700]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added logging on replicate queue processing in the presence of errors or when the duration exceeds 50% of the timeout. [#86007][#86007]
- [Full cluster restores](../v22.2/restore.html#full-cluster) now fail if an upgrade may be in progress. [#86848][#86848]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added the **Insights Overview** page for statements to show if there are index recommendations, high retry count, and unknown for scenarios that don't fall into those categories. [#86688][#86688]
- Added the **Schedules** page to the DB Console. [#86409][#86409]
- Added the **Statement Insight Details** page to DB Console. [#86779][#86779]
- Added transaction and statement fingerprint IDs to their correlating tabs on the **SQL Activity** page in the DB Console. New columns are hidden by default. [#85464][#85464]
- Change column name from `User` to `User Name` on the **Table Details** and **Grants** pages in the DB Console. [#86990][#86990]
- Update "Sub-Optimal" label to "Suboptimal". [#87068][#87068]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The timescale object is now properly constructed from session storage, preventing bugs and crashes in pages that use the timescale object when reloading the page. [#86909][#86909]
- Previously, escaping a double quote (`"`) with `COPY` in `CSV` mode could ignore all subsequent lines in the same `COPY` if an `ESCAPE` clause were specified. This is now resolved. [#86929][#86929]
- Changefeeds emitting to [Kafka](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html#create-a-changefeed-connected-to-kafka) upon receiving a "message too large" error will now halve the size of their batches until it either succeeds or a batch size of 1 fails. [#86138][#86138]
- Added a missing memory accounting call when appending a KV to the underlying `kvBuf`. [#86738][#86738]
- Fixed the latency that is reported for `COPY` commands in the CLI and statistics reporting. [#86991][#86991]
