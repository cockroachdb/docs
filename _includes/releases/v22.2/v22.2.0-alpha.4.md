## v22.2.0-alpha.4

Release Date: September 22, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-4-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Changefeeds are more efficient during initial scan and backfill. The impact on runtime garbage-collection is signficantly reduced, resulting in significantly reduced impact of the changefeed on foreground SQL latency. [#87796][#87796]
- Backup and restore now can back up and restore user-defined function descriptors at database and cluster level. [#88023][#88023]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- A hint is now provided when importing from a CSV file fails because a null value has leading or trailing whitespace or because a value is quoted when the `allow_quoted_null` option is not set. [#87443][#87443]
- Instead of always recommending to replace the first existing index with the same explicit columns, the index recommendation now considers all existing indexes in the table to decide the best one to replace. [#87174][#87174]
- Owners of a backup schedule can now control their schedule using the supported pause, resume, drop and alter queries. [#87600][#87600]
- Previously, a schema could be renamed even when a child table was referenced by a view or UDF. Renaming the schema breaks the view or UDF since tables are referenced by name in views and UDFs. A check has been added that disallows renaming a schema that is referenced in views or UDFs. [#87540][#87540]
- Users may now be granted the CHANGEFEED privilege on a table, allowing them to create changefeeds for that table even if they don't have the CONTROLCHANGEFEED role option or the SELECT privilege. Note that this still in effect gives them the ability to read the data in the table. Users with the CONTROLCHANGEFEED role option still need SELECT on each table, even if they also have CHANGEFEED. [#87887][#87887]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The \c metacommand no longer shows the password in cleartext. [#87538][#87538]
- Cockroach demo no longer runs multi-tenant mode by default. [#87810][#87810]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed the active transaction description. Removed transaction insights details elapsed time because it is not available and was the contention time. [#87604][#87604]
- Internal sessions and active executions are now surfaced in the UI only when the cluster setting `sql.stats.response.show_internal.enabled` is set to true. [#87608][#87608]
- When there is no insight problem detected, a message indicates that the statement was slow and how long it took to execute. [#87799][#87799]
- The Insight Statement Detail page is linked from the Insight Statement page but no longer includes a link to itself. [#87800][#87800]
- Added the ability to copy an index recommendation to the clipboard. [#87794][#87794]
- Fixed the index and grant sorting on the database page to have default column and to have url match the user selection. [#87832][#87832]
- Added Application Name to Statement overview, Transaction Overview (and their respective column selectors), Transaction Details. Updated label from "App" to "Application Name" on Statement Details page. [#87868][#87868]
- The value for percentage of all runtime is now calculated based on all data from the time period. Previously, it was calculated based on only the filtered data. [#88027][#88027]
- The Contention column has been renamed to Contention time. This matches other columns such as Elapsed time. [#88040][#88040]
- An Insights link has been added to all insights pages, and the message on the Schema Insights message has been updated to match the message on the Workload Insights page. [#88012][#88012]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The statement bundle produced for statements that use no tables (e.g. `select 123`) now properly includes an empty `schema.sql`. [#86484][#86484]
- Some upgrade migrations perform schema changes on system tables. Previously, those upgrades which added indexes could, in some cases, get caught retrying because they failed to detect that the migration had already occurred due to the existence of a populated field. When that happened, the finalization of the new version could hang indefinitely and require manual intervention. This issue no longer occurs. [#87623][#87623]
- Previously, the `is_generated` column in the `information_schema.column` table returned either `YES` or `NO`, depending on whether the column is computed. The column now returns either `ALWAYS` or `NEVER`. This matches the behavior of PostgreSQL. [#87670][#87670]
- In rare cases, the value of a cluster setting could revert soon after it was updated. This no longer happens for a given gateway node. [#87732][#87732]
- The UI no longer crashes when no text is being passed to the limit text function. [#87797][#87797]
- In some scenarios, when a DROP INDEX statement was run around the same time as a DROP TABLE or DROP DATABASE statement covering the same data, the `DROP INDEX` garbage-collection job could get caught retrying indefinitely. This has been fixed. [#87721][#87721]
- A consistency check is now skipped/stopped when the collection request is canceled before/while running the check computation. Previously such checks would start and run until completion, and, due to the limited size of the worker pool, prevent the useful checks from running. [#87841][#87841]
- Consistency checks are now sent to all replicas in parallel. Previously, they were blocked on processing the local replica first. This reduces the latency of one check by 2x and allows better propagation of the cancelation signal, resulting in fewer abandoned tasks on remote replicas and more resources spent on useful checks. [#87841][#87841]
- Because of a misused query optimization involving tables with one or more PARTITION BY clauses and partition zone constraints which assign region locality to those partitions, in some cases the optimizer would pick a `locality-optimized search` query plan which is not truly locality-optimized and has higher latency than competing query plans which use distributed scan. Locality-optimized search is now avoided in cases which are known not to benefit from this optimization. [#87866][#87866]
- Improved the default output when using a SELECT clause with a CHANGEFEED. [#87961][#87961]
- A bug has been fixed that caused scheduled backups to fail after a pre-22.2 cluster was upgraded to v22.2 because because they could not find the proto messages when unmarshalling the scheduled job records. [#87999][#87999]
- An active replication report update could prevent a node from shutting down until it completed. The report update is now cancelled on node shutdown instead. [#87925][#87925]
