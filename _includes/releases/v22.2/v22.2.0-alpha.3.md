## v22.2.0-alpha.3

Release Date: September 12, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-enterprise-edition-changes">{{site.data.products.enterprise}} edition changes</h3>

- The new `kv.rangefeed.range_stuck_threshold` (default 60s) [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) instructs RangeFeed clients (used internally by [changefeeds](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html)) to restart automatically if no checkpoint or other event has been received from the server for some time. This is a defense-in-depth mechanism which will log output as follows if triggered: `restarting stuck rangefeed: waiting for r100 (n1,s1):1 [threshold 1m]: rangefeed restarting due to inactivity` [#86820][#86820]
- Fixed a null pointer exception when [`ALTER BACKUP SCHEDULE`](../v22.2/alter-backup.html) was called after a dependent schedule was dropped. [#87293][#87293]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Allow mismatched type numbers in `PREPARE` statements. [#86904][#86904]
- Users can grant a new `EXTERNALIOIMPLICITACCESS` system privilege that allows a user to interact with an External Storage resource that has implicit authentication. E.g., `gs`, `s3`, `nodelocal`, etc. Previously, this was an admin only operation. Release justification: high impact change to introduce fine grained privileges around our interaction with External Storage resources [#87066][#87066]
- We now support `DISCARD {TEMP,TEMPORARY}`, which drops all [temporary tables](../v22.2/temporary-tables.html) created in the current session. The command does not drop temporary schemas. [#86246][#86246]
- [`CREATE SCHEDULE`](../v22.2/create-schedule-for-backup.html) is no longer an admin only operation. Users should grant the appropriate [`BACKUP`](../v22.2/backup.html) privileges on the targets they wish to back up as part of the schedule. Cluster [backups](../v22.2/backup.html) require admin or system privilege `BACKUP`; DB backups require database privilege `BACKUP`; table backups require table privilege `BACKUP`. Release justification: high impact change for fine grained permission control. [#87188][#87188]
- Decreased the cardinality of the number on `__moreN__` when replacing literals. [#87202][#87202]
- When adding a `SECONDARY REGION` to a [multi-region database](../v22.2/multiregion-overview.html), the region is implicitly added to the regions list of the database if it was not present already. [#87108][#87108]
- Added the `pg_get_function_def` [function](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html), which returns the `CREATE` statement that can be used to create the given user-defined function. For built-in functions, it only returns the name of the function. Release justification: low risk enhancement for compatibility. [#87439][#87439]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- This change introduces a new histogram implementation that will reduce the total number of buckets and standardize them across all usage. This should help increase the usability of histograms when exported to a UI (i.e., Grafana) and reduce the storage overhead. After applying this patch it is expected to see fewer buckets in prometheus/grafana, but still  have similar values for histogram percentiles due to the use of interpolated values by Prometheus. [#86671][#86671]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Improved the output of sinkless [changefeeds](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html) in the [`cockroach sql`](../v22.2/cockroach-sql.html) terminal. Release justification: Prevents UX degradation in v22.2 as a side effect of fixing the `bytea_output` bug. [#85181][#85181]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- In the [session details](../v22.2/ui-sessions-page.html) page, users can click on a transaction fingerprint id from the list of cached transaction fingerprints to go to that transaction's details page. The app will also change the selected date range to that of the session's start (rounded down to the hour) and end time (rounded up to the hour) on click. [#86919][#86919]
- Properly formatted the execution count under [Statement Details](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html) page. Increased the timeout for Statement Details page, which now shows a proper timeout error when this happens, no longer crashing the page. [#87153][#87153]
- Add a column selector to the statement insights page and add new contention, full scan, [transaction](../v22.2/transactions.html) id, transaction fingerprint id, and rows read/written info. [#87171][#87171]
- Add warning about performance being affected when executing an [index](../v22.2/indexes.html) recommendation. [#87185][#87185]
- Fixed the time spent waiting on insights on the [transaction details](../v22.2/ui-transactions-page.html) page. Change insights transaction overview column from elapsed time to contention time. Add 3 dots to the query text to show there is more to the query. [#87239][#87239]
- Introduce new graphs on metrics to the [replication dashboard](../v22.2/ui-replication-dashboard.html) to improve [decommissioning](../v22.2/node-shutdown.html) observability. [#86702][#86702]
- Show [index](../v22.2/indexes.html) recommendations of [`ALTER INDEX`](../v22.2/alter-index.html) type (both in [Statement Details](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html) page and on Insights page). [#87458][#87458]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The statement tag for the [`SHOW`](../v22.2/show-vars.html) command results in the pgwire protocol no longer containing the number of returned rows. Release justification: low risk bug fix. [#87047][#87047]
- Fixed a bug where the options given to the [`BEGIN TRANSACTION`](../v22.2/begin-transaction.html) command would be ignored if the `BEGIN` was a prepared statement. Release justification: low risk bug fix. [#87047][#87047]
- When printing keys and range start/end boundaries for time series, the displayed structure of keys was incorrect. This is now fixed. [#86563][#86563]
- A bug has been fixed that caused internal errors like `"unable to [vectorize](../v22.2/vectorized-execution.html) execution plan: unhandled expression type"` in rare cases. [#86816][#86816]
- Fixed a race condition where some operations waiting on locks can cause the lockholder [transaction](../v22.2/transactions.html) to be aborted if they occur before the transaction can write its record. Release justification: Bug fix. [#83688][#83688]
- The Explain Tab inside the [Statement Details](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html) page now groups plans that have the same shape but a different number of spans in corresponding scans. [#87152][#87152]
- `DISCARD ALL` now deletes [temporary tables](../v22.2/temporary-tables.html). Release justification: bug fix. [#86246][#86246]
- A bug in the column backfiller, which is used to add or remove columns from tables, failed to account for the need to read [virtual columns](../v22.2/computed-columns.html) which were part of a [primary key](../v22.2/primary-key.html). [Hash-sharded](../v22.2/hash-sharded-indexes.html) [indexes](../v22.2/indexes.html), starting in v22.1, use [virtual columns](../v22.2/computed-columns.html). Any [hash-sharded](../v22.2/hash-sharded-indexes.html) table created in v22.1 or any table created with a virtual column as part of its primary key would indefinitely fail to complete a [schema change](../v22.2/online-schema-changes.html) which adds or removes columns. This bug has been fixed. [#87207][#87207]
- Reduce the amount that [`RESTORE`](../v22.2/restore.html) over-splits. [#86496][#86496]
- Table `system.replication_constraint_stats` is no longer showing erroneous voter constraint violations when `num_voters` is configured. Release justification: bugfix to an issue which also needs backporting. [#84727][#84727]
- This patch fixes a bug in lookup [join](../v22.2/joins.html) selectivity estimation involving [hash-sharded](../v22.2/hash-sharded-indexes.html) [indexes](../v22.2/indexes.html) which may cause lookup joins to be selected by the [optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) in cases where other join methods are less expensive. [#86622][#86622]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- [Raft snapshots](../v22.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#snapshots) use a fair round-robin approach for choosing which one to send next. This allows [decommissioning](../v22.2/node-shutdown.html) to complete much faster. Release justification: A number of customer support cases are caused by incorrect snapshot prioritization. [#86701][#86701]
- The [optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) is now less likely to choose an expensive lookup [join](../v22.2/joins.html) with a complex `ON` condition over a less selective join that is cheaper to perform. [#87393][#87393]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-alpha-3-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- Add basic validation for [zone config](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html) extension setting. [#86538][#86538]
