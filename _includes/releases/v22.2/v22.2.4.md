## v22.2.4

Release Date: February 13, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-4-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Added the `COCKROACH_TLS_ENABLE_OLD_CIPHER_SUITES` environment variable, which re-enables some less secure TLS 1.2 cipher suites for use with legacy clients. [#95705][#95705]

<h3 id="v22-2-4-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`](../v22.2/alter-changefeed.html) that would panic when altering a changefeed to remove a table that had already been dropped. [#95785][#95785]
- Updated memory accounting for [changefeeds](../v22.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html) to improve cluster stability. [#96182][#96182]
- The `confluent_schema_registry` URI for [avro changefeeds](../v22.2/changefeed-messages.html#avro) now supports the `client_cert` and `client_key` params. [#96533][#96533]

<h3 id="v22-2-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The [`SHOW GRANTS ON EXTERNAL CONNECTION`](../v22.2/show-grants.html) and [`SHOW SYSTEM GRANTS`](../v22.2/show-system-grants.html) commands now use a column name of `privilege_type` rather than `privilege`. For external connections, the `name` column was changed to `connection_name`. This makes the commands consistent with other `SHOW GRANTS` commands. [#95567][#95567]
- If `copy_from_retries_enabled` is set, [`COPY`](../v22.2/copy-from.html) is now able to retry under certain safe circumstances - namely when `copy_from_atomic_enabled` is false, there is no [transaction](../v22.2/transactions.html) running `COPY`, and the error returned is retryable. This prevents users who keep running into [`TransactionProtoWithRefreshError`](../v22.2/transaction-retry-error-reference.html) from having issues. [#95496][#95496]
- Improved the performance of [trigram operations](../v22.2/trigram-indexes.html). [#94199][#94199]
- [`COPY ... FROM ... QUOTE '"'`](../v22.2/copy-from.html) will no longer error. [#96766][#96766]

<h3 id="v22-2-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Histogram metrics in the [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html) (such as on the [SQL Dashboard](../v22.2/ui-sql-dashboard.html), for example) can now optionally use the legacy `HdrHistogram` model by setting the environment variable `COCKROACH_ENABLE_HDR_HISTOGRAMS=true` on CockroachDB nodes. **Note that this is not recommended** unless users are having difficulties with the newer Prometheus-backed histogram model. Enabling these metrics can cause performance issues with timeseries databases like Prometheus, as processing and storing the increased number of buckets is taxing on both CPU and storage. Note that the `HdrHistogram` model is slated for full deprecation in an upcoming release. [#96514][#96514]
- Prometheus histograms will now export more buckets across the board to improve precision & fidelity of information reported by histogram metrics, such as quantiles, as shown in multiple pages in the [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html). This will lead to an increase in storage requirements to process these histogram metrics in downstream systems like Prometheus, but should still be a marked improvement when compared to the legacy `HdrHistogram` model. If users have issues with the precision of these bucket boundaries, they can set the environment variable `COCKROACH_ENABLE_HDR_HISTOGRAMS=true` to revert to using the legacy `HdrHistogram` model instead, although this is not recommended otherwise as the `HdrHistogram` metrics strain systems like Prometheus with excessive numbers of histogram buckets. Note that the `HdrHistogram` model is slated for full deprecation in an upcoming release. [#96514][#96514]

<h3 id="v22-2-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Removed `reset sql stats` and `reset index stats` from the [SQL Activity Page](../v22.2/ui-transactions-page.html) when the user is not an [`admin` user](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). [#95331][#95331]
- The [statement fingerprint details](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html#sql-statement-fingerprints) page in the DB Console no longer gets stuck infinitely loading after 5 minutes. [#95246][#95246]
- Graphs in the [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html) can be clicked on to toggle legend "stickiness" and make the points stop following the mouse. This makes it easier to read dense graphs with many series plotted together. [#94787][#94787]
- Removed `reset sql stats` from the [Transactions page](../v22.2/ui-transactions-page.html) for non-admin users. [#95520][#95520]
- The DB Console now hides the apply option for [index recommendation](../v22.2/ui-databases-page.html#index-recommendations) when user is not an [`admin` user](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). [#95598][#95598]

<h3 id="v22-2-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a crash that could happen when formatting a tuple with an unknown type in the pgwire protocol. [#95401][#95401]
- Fixed a rare bug which could cause [upgrades from v22.1 to v22.2](../v22.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) to fail if the job coordinator node crashes in the middle of a specific upgrade migration. [#93553][#93553]
- Fixed a bug where `CLOSE ALL` on a cursor would not respect the `ALL` flag and would instead attempt to close a cursor with no name. [#95442][#95442]
- [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html) features that check for the [`VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` privilege](../v22.2/alter-role.html#role-options) now also account for [global privileges](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#system-level-privileges). [#95457][#95457]
- Fixed a bug where a [database restore](../v22.2/restore.html) would not [grant `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges](../v22.2/grant.html) on the public [schema](../v22.2/create-schema.html) to the public [role](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#users-and-roles). [#95531][#95531]
- Reduced contention between registering and deregistering [sessions](../v22.2/show-sessions.html), as well as [query cancellation](../v22.2/cancel-query.html) inside a session. [#95626][#95626]
- Fixed the `pg_get_indexdef` function so that it shows the expression used to define an [expression-based index](../v22.2/expression-indexes.html). Also fixed a bug where the function was previously including columns stored by the index, which was incorrect. [#95584][#95584]
- Fixed a bug present since v22.2 when adding new columns to a table with [`DEFAULT` expressions](../v22.2/default-value.html) that differ from the type of the [column](../v22.2/show-columns.html). In CockroachDB you can do this as long as the expression's type can be cast in an assignment context. When adding a new column, the code in the backfill logic was not sophisticated enough to know to add the cast; when such a default expression was added to a new column it would result in a panic during the backfill. [#95451][#95451]
- Fixed a bug where a DNS lookup was performed during gossip remote forwarding while holding the gossip mutex. This could cause processing stalls if the DNS server was slow to respond, since we need to acquire gossip read locks in several performance critical code paths, including [Raft processing](../v22.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#raft). [#95443][#95443]
- Operations like [`BACKUP`](../v22.2/backup.html) can now reuse a previously created [AWS KMS client](../v22.2/take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html#use-key-management-service) if the client was created with the same parameters. This addresses the `NoCredentialProviders` errors on EC2 with for backups with long incremental chains. [#95534][#95534]
- Fixed a bug where [trigrams](../v22.2/trigram-indexes.html) ignored Unicode (multi-byte) characters from input strings. [#94199][#94199]
- Fixed the `array_to_string` [built-in function](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html#array_to_string) so that nested arrays are traversed without printing 'ARRAY' at each nesting level. [#95843][#95843]
- Fixed a bug in which [`RESTORE SYSTEM USERS`](../v22.2/restore.html) would fail to restore [role](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#users-and-roles) options. [#95293][#95293]
- Fixed a bug causing [ranges](../v22.2/architecture/overview.html#architecture-range) to remain without a [leaseholder](../v22.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) in cases of asymmetric [network partitions](../v22.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#network-partition). [#95221][#95221]
- Fixed a bug whereby a [stalled disk](../v22.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#disk-stalls) would sometimes be undetected, hanging the CockroachDB process indefinitely. Now the stall is detected and the process is terminated if the `storage.max_sync_duration.fatal.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) is enabled, and the stall is observed to last longer than the value in the `storage.max_sync_duration` cluster setting. [#96036][#96036]
- Fixed a bug where [`COPY`](../v22.2/copy-from.html)ing into a column with [collated strings](../v22.2/collate.html) would result in an error similar to `internal error: unknown type collatedstring`. [#96035][#96035]
- Fixed a bug in [temporary schemas](../v22.2/temporary-tables.html#temporary-schemas) whereby `DISCARD ALL` or `DISCARD TEMP` could prevent [temporary tables](../v22.2/temporary-tables.html) from working. [#96102][#96102]
- Fixed an internal error which may occur in the [`SHOW RANGE FROM TABLE`](../v22.2/show-range-for-row.html) statement when the `FOR ROW` clause specifies a [`BYTE` literal](../v22.2/bytes.html) and the corresponding column data type is [`BIT`](../v22.2/bit.html). [#96106][#96106]
- Fixed a bug whereby a system [check constraint](../v22.2/check.html) on `statement_diagnostics_requests` was not properly added when upgrading from the previous CockroachDB release. [#96220][#96220]
- Fixed a bug where a node with a [disk stall](../v22.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#disk-stalls) would continue to accept new connections and preserve existing connections until the disk stall abated. [#96145][#96145]
- Fixed a bug where the [global `NOSQLLOGIN` privilege](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#system-level-privileges) was ignored entirely, so it had no effect. The bug was introduced in [v22.2.0-alpha.1](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-0-alpha-1). The `NOSQLLOGIN` [role](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#users-and-roles) option is unaffected by this bug. [#96520][#96520]
- Fixed a bug where a [disk stall](../v22.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#disk-stalls) could go undetected under the rare circumstance that several goroutines simultaneously sync the data directory. [#96662][#96662]
- The [SQL Activity page](../v22.2/ui-transactions-page.html) will no longer crash (showing the error page) when [upgrading to v22.2](../v22.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html). [#96454][#96454]

<h3 id="v22-2-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- In v22.2, we introduced support for `DISCARD TEMP` and made `DISCARD ALL` actually discard [temp tables](../v22.2/temporary-tables.html). This implementation ran expensive logic to discover temp schemas rather than consulting in-memory data structures. As a result, `DISCARD ALL`, which is issued regularly by connection pools, became an expensive operation when it should have been cheap. This problem is now resolved. [#96102][#96102]
- In v22.2, logic was added to make `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION DEFAULT` not a no-op. This implementation used more general code for setting the [role](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#users-and-roles) for a [session](../v22.2/show-sessions.html) which made sure that the role exists. The check for whether a role exists is currently uncached. We don't need to check if the role we already are exists. This improves the performance of `DISCARD ALL` in addition to `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION DEFAULT`. [#96102][#96102]
