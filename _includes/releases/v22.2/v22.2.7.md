## v22.2.7

Release Date: March 27, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-7-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The default value for the [`server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256`](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) cluster setting is now `10610`. (Previously the default was `119680`.) The previous value was too high for many types of client hardware, and in some cases could cause regressions in connection latency. The new value was chosen by running tests with clients that have 1 or 2 vCPUs provisioned.  Additionally, the new cluster setting `server.user_login.rehash_scram_stored_passwords_on_cost_change.enabled` was added, and defaults to `true`. If it is `true` and the stored SCRAM password for a user has a different cost than the configured default cost, then the next time the user logs in, their password will automatically be rehashed using the configured default cost.  If the rehashing is not desired, then operators should update the `server.user_login.password_hashes.default_cost.scram_sha_256` cluster setting to the value they desire before upgrading. [#98318][#98318]
- Previously, users could gain unauthorized access to [statement diagnostic bundles](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html#diagnostics) they did not create if they requested the bundle through an HTTP request to `/_admin/v1/stmtbundle/<id>` and correctly guessed its (non-secret) `ID`.  This change now locks down the endpoint behind the SQL gating and uses the correct SQL user in the HTTP session as identified by their cookie. [#99053][#99053]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug preventing the creation of [changefeeds](../v22.2/change-data-capture-overview.html) to [`external:// URIs`](../v22.2/create-external-connection.html). [#98680][#98680]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a new [session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html), `optimizer_use_improved_split_disjunction_for_joins`, which enables the optimizer to split disjunctions (`OR` expressions) in more `JOIN` conditions by building a `UNION` of two `JOIN` expressions. If this setting is `true`, all disjunctions in inner, semi, and anti `JOIN`s will be split. If `false`, only disjunctions potentially containing an equi `JOIN` condition will be split. [#97823][#97823]
- Added support for the syntax [`CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ... WITH OWNER`](../v22.2/create-database.html). [#97974][#97974]
- Introduced a new internal virtual table `crdb_internal.node_memory_monitors`, which exposes all of the current reservations with the memory accounting system on a single node. Access to the table requires `VIEWACTIVITY` or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` [permissions](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#supported-privileges). [#97865][#97865]
- Added a new [session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html) `optimizer_always_use_histograms`, which ensures that the [optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) always uses histograms when available to calculate the [statistics](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) of every plan that it explores. Enabling this setting can prevent the optimizer from choosing a suboptimal index when statistics for a table are stale. [#98230][#98230]
- Added a new aggregate [builtin function](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html#array-functions) `array_cat_agg`. It behaves similarly to `array_agg(unnest(array_column))`: it takes arrays as its input and unnests them into array elements, which are then aggregated into a single result array. This is similar to concatenating all input arrays into a single one. [#98171][#98171]
- Added the [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.auth.modify_cluster_setting_applies_to_all.enabled` to regulate whether `MODIFYCLUSTERSETTING` can edit non `sql.defaults` settings. [#98234][#98234]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB panicked when a user tried to [truncate](../v22.2/truncate.html) a table that has an ongoing [row-level TTL](../v22.2/row-level-ttl.html) change. CockroachDB still does not support table truncates in this scenario, but instead of panicking, an unimplemented error is returned. [#98591][#98591]
- Added two views to the [`crdb_internal`](../v22.2/crdb-internal.html) catalog: `crdb_internal.statement_statistics_persisted`, which surfaces data in the persisted `system.statement_statistics` table and `crdb_internal.transaction_statistics_persisted`, which surfaces the `system.transaction_statistics` table. [#98684][#98684]
- The SQL Activity page now displays only persisted stats when selecting to [view fingerprints](../v22.2/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprints-view). This means data recently executed might take up to 10 minutes to show on the [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html). [#99044][#99044]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new [metric](../v22.2/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html) `changefeed.schema_registry.retry_count`. This measures the number of request retries performed when sending requests to the [changefeed schema registry](../v22.2/stream-a-changefeed-to-a-confluent-cloud-kafka-cluster.html). Observing a non-zero value may indicate improper configuration of the schema registry or changefeed parameters. [#98349][#98349]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- [Workloads](../v22.2/cockroach-workload.html) that take a `--seed` argument used to default to `1`. Now, they use a randomly generated seed in each run. Users can still pass a custom seed with the `--seed` flag. [#95695][#95695]
- The `--drain-wait` argument to the [`cockroach node drain`](../v22.2/cockroach-node.html) command will be automatically increased if the command detects that it is smaller than the sum of the [cluster settings](../v22.2/node-shutdown.html#cluster-settings) `server.shutdown.drain_wait`, `server.shutdown.connection_wait`, `server.shutdown.query_wait` times two, and `server.shutdown.lease_transfer_wait`. If the `--drain-wait argument` is `0`, then no timeout is used. [#98577][#98577]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed the error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`, which can cause [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html) pages fail to load. [#98236][#98236]
- Updated the column selector icon to show the gear icon and "Columns". [#98915][#98915]
- Updated the Jobs table column name from "Last Modified Time" to "Last Execution Time". [#99036][#99036]
- Fixed link encoding on links to database/table/index pages. [#97930][#97930]
- The [Jobs](../v22.2/ui-jobs-page.html) page now displays an error state when an error occurs during data fetching. [#97723][#97723]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in [v22.1](../releases/v22.1.html) that caused the internal error `no bytes in account to release ...`. [#97773][#97773]
- Fixed a bug that caused an internal error when trying to execute a [UDF](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) with an empty function body. This bug was present since UDFs were introduced in [v22.2.0](../releases/v22.2#v22-2-0.html). [#93834][#93834]
- Fixed the [`SHOW CREATE ALL {TYPES|SCHEMAS|TABLES}`](../v22.2/show-create.html) commands to handle database names that have mixed-case, hyphens, or quotes. [#97937][#97937]
- Changed the database used for SQL API calls to no longer use `defaultdb`, which was causing error messages on some pages when that database no longer exists. [#98052][#98052]
- The owner of the public schema can now be changed using [`ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO new_owner`](../v22.2/alter-schema.html). [#98065][#98065]
- Fixed a bug where the experimental scrub command did not handle type descriptors in the database. [#91459][#91459]
- Fixed a bug where [common table expressions (CTEs)](../v22.2/common-table-expressions.html) marked as `WITH RECURSIVE`  that were not actually recursive could return incorrect results. This could happen if the CTE used a [`UNION ALL`](../v22.2/common-table-expressions.html#recursive-common-table-expressions), because the optimizer incorrectly converted the `UNION ALL` to a `UNION`. This bug has existed since suppport for recursive CTEs was first added in [v20.1](../releases/v20.1.html). [#98115][#98115]
- Since [v22.1](../releases/v22.1.html) when [rangefeed enablement](../v22.2/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) overrides in span configs were introduced, rangefeed requests that reached spans outside the range would not cause range cache invalidation due to the setting being checked first, thus requests could repeatedly hit the same incorrect range, causing errors until cache invalidation or node restart. This fix correctly checks that the span is within the range prior to checking the enablement settings, thus invalidating the cache when a request reaches an incorrect range and causes subsequent requests to successfully reach the correct range. [#97659][#97659]
- Previously, the [declarative schema changer](../v22.2/online-schema-changes.html#declarative-schema-changer) would emit alarming messages of the form: `failed building declarative schema change targets for...`. These were non-severe in nature and are now disabled by default. [#98258][#98258]
- Fixed a bug where new schema changes that used the [declarative schema changer](../v22.2/online-schema-changes.html#declarative-schema-changer) in a mixed version state upgrading from [v22.1](../releases/v22.1.html) did not execute properly. The impacted [schema changes](../v22.2/online-schema-changes.html) are `ADD COLUMN`, `DROP COLUMN`, `ALTER PRIMARY KEY`, `CREATE INDEX`, `DROP OWNED BY`, `COMMENT ON`, and `DROP INDEX`. [#98379][#98379]
- Fixed a bug where if an [`UPDATE`](../v22.2/update.html) was performed during an ongoing [`ADD COLUMN`](../v22.2/alter-table.html#add-column) or [`DROP COLUMN`](../v22.2/alter-table.html#drop-column) on a table, the update could incorrectly fail due to a duplicate key error. [#98505][#98505]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could encounter the internal error `concurrent txn use detected`. The bug was introduced in [v22.2.0](../releases/v22.2.html). [#98406][#98406]
- Fixed a bug that could crash the process when a query contained a literal [tuple expression](../v22.2/scalar-expressions.html#tuple-constructors) with more than two elements and only a single label, e.g., `((1, 2, 3) AS foo)`. [#98315][#98315]
- Fixed a bug where the stats columns on the [Transaction Fingerprint overview page](../v22.2/ui-transactions-page.html#transaction-fingerprints-view) did not not continuously increment. [#98336][#98336]
- Fixed a bug in evaluation of `ANY`, `SOME`, and `ALL` [sub-operators](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html#operators) that would cause expressions like `NULL = ANY(ARRAY[]::INT[])` to return `NULL` instead of `false`. [#98165][#98165]
- Users with `VIEWACTIVITY`/`VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` [permissions](../v22.2/security-reference/authorization.html#role-options) are now allowed to access the [`crdb_internal.ranges_no_leases`](../v22.2/crdb-internal.html) table, necessary to view important [DB Console](../v22.2/ui-overview.html) pages (such as the Databases page, including database details, and database tables). [#98645][#98645]
- Fixed a bug where it was possible for CockroachDB to temporarily not respect [zone configurations](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html) other than the [default zone configuration](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#view-the-default-replication-zone). This could only happen for a short window after nodes with existing [replicas](../v22.2/architecture/overview.html#architecture-replica) were restarted (measured in seconds), and self-rectified (also within seconds). These issues lasted a few seconds post node-restarts, and any zone configuration violations were rectified shortly after. This manifested in a few ways: [#98803][#98803]
    - If [`num_replicas`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#num_replicas) was set to something other than 3, CockroachDB would still add or remove replicas to get to 3x replication.   
    - If [`num_voters`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#num_voters) was set explicitly to get a mix of voting and non-voting replicas, it would be ignored. CockroachDB could possibly remove non-voting replicas. 
    - If [`range_min_bytes`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#range-min-bytes) or [`range_max_bytes`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#range-max-bytes) were changed from their default values of 128 MiB and 512 MiB respectively, CockroachDB would instead try to size ranges to be within [128 MiB, 512MiB]. This could appear as an excess amount of range splits or merges, as visible in the [Replication Dashboard](../v22.2/ui-replication-dashboard.html) under "Range Operations". 
    - If [`gc.ttlseconds`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#gc-ttlseconds) was set to something other than 90000 seconds, CockroachDB would still only GC data older than 90000s/25h. If the GC TTL was set to something larger than 25h, [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v22.2/as-of-system-time.html) queries going further back could start failing. For GC TTLs less than the 25h default, clusters would observe increased disk usage due to more retained [MVCC garbage](../v22.2/performance-recipes.html#too-many-mvcc-values). 
    - If [`constraints`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#constraints), [`lease_preferences`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#lease_preferences), or [`voter_constraints`](../v22.2/configure-replication-zones.html#voter_constraints) were set, they would be ignored. Range data and leases would possibly be moved outside where prescribed. 
- Fixed a bug where using the `ST_Transform` function could result in a memory leak. [#98836][#98836]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results of tuples using the `ANY` [operator](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html#operators). For example, an expression like `(x, y) = ANY (SELECT a, b FROM t WHERE ...)` could return `true` instead of the correct result of `NULL` when `x` and `y` were `NULL`, or `a` and `b` were `NULL`. This could only occur if the [subquery was correlated](../v22.2/subqueries.html#correlated-subqueries), i.e., it references columns from the outer part of the query. This bug was present since the [cost-based optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) was introduced in  [v2.1](../releases/v2.1.html). [#98769][#98769]
- Set `bulkio.restore.use_simple_import_spans` to `true`. If the setting is `false`, a [`RESTORE`](../v22.2/restore.html) job can emit missed files from the first few spans of the job resume. [#99068][#99068]
- Fixed a bug introduced in [v22.2.6](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-6) in which a [`RESTORE`](../v22.2/restore.html) job, on [`RESUME`](../v22.2/resume-job.html), can miss files for the first few spans being restored. [#99046][#99046]
- Fixed a bug in which [`RESTORE TABLE`](../v22.2/restore.html#tables) may fail to restore a table with a missing sequence despite `skip_missing_sequences` being used. [#99071][#99071]
- Reverted a series of changes, introduced in [v22.2.6](../releases/v22.2.html#v22-2-6), in which a [`RESTORE`](../v22.2/restore.html) job that was retried or resumed after being paused could fail to correctly restore some rows. [#99066][#99066] 

<h3 id="v22-2-7-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- If the [session setting](../v22.2/set-vars.html) `optimizer_use_improved_split_disjunction_for_joins` is `true`, the optimizer now creates a better query plan in some cases where an inner, semi, or anti [`JOIN`](../v22.2/joins.html) contains a join predicate with a disjuction (`OR` condition). [#97823][#97823]

<h3 id="v22-2-7-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Upgraded Golang to version 1.19.6 [#97761][#97761]
- Starting with Cockroach v22.2.7, a FIPS compliant tarball and docker image is published for the Linux `x86_64` platform. The build uses OpenSSL libraries for crypto operations by `dlopen`ing the corresponding dynamic libraries. [#97625][#97625]
- Changes to source files in `pkg/ui/workspaces/db-console` now properly bust the build cache, and are consistently included in local builds. [#97960][#97960]
