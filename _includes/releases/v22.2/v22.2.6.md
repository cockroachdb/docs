## v22.2.6

Release Date: March 3, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-2-6-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Introduced the `server.user_login.downgrade_scram_stored_passwords_to_bcrypt.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html), which defaults to `true`. If it is `true` **and** `server.user_login.password_encryption` is set to `crdb-bcrypt`, then during login, the stored hashed password will be converted from [`SCRAM`](../v22.2/security-reference/scram-authentication.html) to `bcrypt`. Previously, the process to change passwords from `SCRAM` hashing to `bcrypt` hashing was always manual and took a long time. An operator may wish to use this cluster setting if their tools do not support `SCRAM`. [#97628][#97628]

<h3 id="v22-2-6-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug in changefeeds where long running [initial scans](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html#initial-scan) would fail to generate checkpoints. Failure to generate [checkpoints](../v22.2/change-data-capture-overview.html#how-does-an-enterprise-changefeed-work) is particularly bad if the changefeed restarts. Without checkpoints, the changefeed will restart from the beginning, and in the worst case, when exporting substantially sized tables, the changefeed initial scan may not complete. [#97049][#97049]
- Added support for an optional external ID when [assuming a role](../v22.2/cloud-storage-authentication.html). You can use this by extending the `ASSUME_ROLE` parameter to the format `ASSUME_ROLE={role};external_id={id}`. When using [role chaining](../v22.2/cloud-storage-authentication.html#amazon-s3-role-chaining), you can associate each role in the chain with a different external ID. For example:

    ~~~sql
    ASSUME_ROLE={roleA};external_id={idA},{roleB};external_id=<idB>,{roleC}
    ~~~

    This will use external ID `{idA}` to assume delegate `{roleA}`, then use external ID `{idB}` to assume delegate `{roleB}`, and finally no external ID to assume the final role `{roleC}`. [#96531][#96531]
- Changefeeds no longer require the `COCKROACH_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_PER_CHANGEFEED_METRICS` environment variable in order to use the [`metrics_label`](../v22.2/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#using-changefeed-metrics-labels) option. [#97509][#97509]

<h3 id="v22-2-6-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Previously, setting a [table's locality](../v22.2/alter-table.html#set-locality) was not allowed if the table contained any hash-sharded indexes. This restriction is now removed. [#96688][#96688]
- Introduced the `declare_cursor_statement_timeout_enabled` [session variable](../v22.2/set-vars.html), which disables statement timeouts during `FETCH` when using `DECLARE CURSOR`. [#97089][#97089]
- Added a hard limit of how much data can be flushed to system tables for SQL stats. [#97399][#97399]
- Added support for expressions of the form `COLLATE "default"`, `COLLATE "C"`, and `COLLATE "POSIX"`. Since the default [collation](../v22.2/collate.html) cannot be changed currently, these expressions are all equivalent. The expressions are evaluated by treating the input as a normal string, and ignoring the collation. This means that comparisons between strings and collated strings that use `"default"`, `"C"`, or `"POSIX"` are now supported. Creating a column with the `"C"` or `"POSIX"` collations is still not supported. [#97415][#97415]
- Previously, you could use [user-defined function](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html) usage from tables with `SET DEFAULT` and `SET ON UPDATE` even though they are disallowed from `CREATE TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN`. This patch disallows those two cases from `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN`. [#97430][#97430]
- Increased the default value of `sql.stats.cleanup.rows_to_delete_per_txn` to 10000, to increase efficiency of the cleanup job for SQL statistics. [#97724][#97724]

<h3 id="v22-2-6-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- A [`BACKUP`](../v22.2/backup.html) that encounters too many retryable errors will now fail instead of pausing to allow subsequent backups the chance to succeed. [#96716][#96716]

<h3 id="v22-2-6-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Previously, when the SQL API returned a "max size reached" error, the DB Console would only show the error, but not the data that was also being returned. Now, the **Statement Insights**, **Transaction Insights**, and **Schema Insights** pages also show the data. [#97470][#97470]
- Added 22 new metrics to track memory usage of prepared statements in sessions. [#97654][#97654]
- Updated the description for [Suboptimal Insight](../v22.2/ui-insights-page.html) and added a **Learn more** link to it. [#97718][#97718]
- Added page controls to the recent execution overview pages so that users can go to the next page when the page limit of results is reached. [#97250][#97250]
- Fixed the pagination on the [Schema Insights view](../v22.2/ui-insights-page.html#schema-insights-view), which was incorrectly showing the number of page results. [#97641][#97641]

<h3 id="v22-2-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that caused the server to crash if trying to restore a table from a backup generated by `BACKUP TABLE` from a schema that includes [user-defined functions](../v22.2/user-defined-functions.html), and the restore target database does not have a schema with the same name. [#96977][#96977]
- Fixed the [`SHOW GRANTS FOR public`](../v22.2/show-grants.html) command so that it no longer returns an error that the `public` role does not exist. [#96998][#96998]
- Fixed a bug where the [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v22.2/as-of-system-time.html) clause was handled incorrectly in an implicit transaction that had multiple statements. [#97146][#97146]
- When upgrading from a v22.1 to v22.2.4 cluster, logging in with a new user would error with `system.privilege does not exist`. When the user privilege was checked during starting up was causing this error. Only v22.2.4 is affected. This change adds a version gate for this check. [#97183][#97183]
- Fixed a syntax error for `SELECT ... QUERY` (without `AS`) statement. [#97156][#97156]
- Fixed a bug where a [restore](../v22.2/restore.html) flow could hang indefinitely in the face of a context cancellation. This would manifest as a stuck restore job. [#97210][#97210]
- Removed the following log message that was produced frequently: `lease [...] expired before being followed by lease [...]; foreground traffic may have been impacted`. [#97377][#97377]
- Fixed a bug in the query engine that could cause incorrect results in some cases when a [zigzag join](../v22.2/joins.html) was planned. The bug could occur when the two indexes used for the zigzag join had a suffix of matching columns, but with different directions. For example, planning a zigzag join with `INDEX(a ASC, b ASC)` and `INDEX(c ASC, b DESC)` could cause incorrect results. This bug has existed since at least v19.1. It is now fixed, because the [optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) will no longer plan a zigzag join in such cases. [#97441][#97441]
- Fixed a bug in [`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`](../v22.2/alter-table.html#add-column) when the new column name requires quoting due to mixed case or special characters and the statement is not run in an explicit or multi-statement transaction. [#97568][#97568]
- Fixed a bug when formatting create statements for user-defined types that require quoting, which might prevent those statements from round-tripping. [#97568][#97568]
- Added support for disabling cross-descriptor validation on lease renewal, which can be problematic when there are lots of descriptors with lots of foreign key references. In these cases, the cross-reference validation could block schema changes. This can be enabled with `sql.catalog.descriptor_lease_renewal_cross_validation`. [#97635][#97635]
- Fixed a bug that would cause node failure when the [`kv.snapshot_delegation.enabled` setting](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) is set to `true`. Further, this unsupported setting is now hidden. [#97648][#97648]
- Fixed a bug that could cause reverse scans to serve stale reads when clocks in a cluster are skewed. Transaction uncertainty intervals are correctly configured for reverse scans again. [#97518][#97518]
- Columns referenced in partial index predicates and partial `UNIQUE` constraint predicates can no longer be dropped. The [`ALTER TABLE .. DROP COLUMN`](../v22.2/alter-table.html#drop-column) statement now returns an error with a hint suggesting to drop the indexes and constraints first. This is a temporary safeguard to prevent users from hitting [#96924](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/96924). This restriction will be lifted when that bug is fixed. [#97678][#97678]
- Fixed a bug where a [backup](../v22.2/take-backups-with-revision-history-and-restore-from-a-point-in-time.html) of keys with many revisions would fail with `pebble: keys must be added in order`. [#97062][#97062]
- Previously, `ALTER TABLE ... INJECT STATISTICS` command would fail if a column with `COLLATED STRING` type had histograms to be injected. This is now fixed. The bug has been present since at least v21.2. [#97491][#97491]

<h3 id="v22-2-6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Long chains of [incremental backups](../v22.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) and restores of such chains will now allocate less memory during the un-marshaling of metadata. [#97210][#97210]
