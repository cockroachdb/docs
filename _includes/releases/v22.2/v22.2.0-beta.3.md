<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-3-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Added user mapping and support for multiple audiences to JWT-based authentication to better integrate with third-party JWT issuers. [#89022][#89022]
- Changefeeds with the [`format=csv`](../v22.2/create-changefeed.html#format) option now use the same format as other CSV exports. [#88669][#88669]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Changed the default value of the [`sql.metrics.statement_details.plan_collection.enabled`](../v22.2/cluster-settings.html) cluster setting to `true`. [#89038][#89038]
- Previously, the `has_function_privilege` [built-in function](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html) and `::regprocedure` casting only considered function names and ignored argument types. An ambiguous error was returned if a function name matched more than one overload. Now, argument types are used to narrow down an overload to avoid ambiguity. Both `has_function_privilege` and `::regprocedure` require a valid full function signature as input. That is, a parenthesis is required even if the function takes zero arguments. `::regproc` has also been modified to consider a whole string as a function name. As a result, every non-leading or non-trailing white space(s) are considered as part of the function name. This is to match PostgreSQL behavior. [#89037][#89037]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the metric `admission.io.overload` that tracks the store's `IOThreshold`. [#88170][#88170]

<h3 id="v22-2-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that prevents changefeeds from retrying when emitting to a [Google Pub/Sub sink](../v22.2/changefeed-sinks.html#google-cloud-pub-sub). [#88865][#88865]
- Audit logs and other structured logs will now use the session user for the `user` field of the log entry, rather than the current user. The session user is the user who originally logged in, and it is immutable. The current user can be modified by [`SET ROLE`](../v22.2/set-vars.html) commands, which means it is not appropriate for this kind of logging. [#88899][#88899]
- Index usage stats are now properly captured for database names with hyphens. [#88998][#88998]
- [Changefeeds](../v22.2/change-data-capture-overview.html) no longer deadlock when canceling during an internal Kafka sink retry. [#89196][#89196]
- Fixed a bug that caused [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`](../v22.2/alter-changefeed.html) to fail if the changefeed was created with the `cursor` option and had been running for more than the `gc.ttlseconds`. [#89206][#89206]
- Fixed a bug where the floor division [operator](../v22.2/functions-and-operators.html), `//`, would report incorrect results when the numerator is non-constant and the denominator is the constant `1`. [#89314][#89314]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.2 that could, in rare cases, cause filters to be dropped from a query plan with many joins. [#89350][#89350]
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect results. The bug would only present if the following conditions were true:   
    1. A query with [`ORDER BY`](../v22.2/order-by.html) and `LIMIT` was executed.
    1. The table containing the `ORDER BY` columns had an index containing those columns.
    1. The index in (2) contained a prefix of columns held to a fixed number of values. The columns can be held to these values by any of the following:
        - A query filter (e.g., `WHERE a IN (1, 3)`).
        - A `CHECK` constraint (e.g., `CHECK (a IN (1, 3))`).
        - A filter inferred from a computed column expression (e.g., `WHERE a IN (1, 3)` and a column `b INT AS (a + 10) STORED`).
        - A filter inferred from a `PARTITION BY` clause (e.g., `INDEX (a, ...) PARTITION BY LIST (a) (PARTITION p VALUES ((1), (3)))`).

    This bug has been present since version v22.1.0. [#89344][#89344]
- Fixed a bug that has existed since v2.1.0 where queries containing a subquery with `EXCEPT` could produce incorrect results. This could happen if the [optimizer](../v22.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) could guarantee that the left side of the `EXCEPT` always returned more rows than the right side. In this case, the optimizer made a faulty assumption that the `EXCEPT` subquery always returned at least one row, which could cause the optimizer to perform an invalid transformation, possibly causing the full query to return incorrect results. [#89305][#89305]
