## v21.1.14

Release Date: February 9, 2022

<h3 id="v21-1-14-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Collated strings may now have a locale that is a language tag, followed by a `-u-` suffix, followed by anything else. For example, any locale with a prefix of `en-US-u-` is now considered valid. [#74754][#74754]

<h3 id="v21-1-14-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Fixed the CLI help text for [`ALTER DATABASE`](../v21.1/alter-database.html) to show correct options for [`ADD REGION`](../v21.1/add-region.html) and [`DROP REGION`](../v21.1/drop-region.html), and include some missing options such as [`CONFIGURE ZONE`](../v21.1/configure-zone.html). [#75075][#75075]

<h3 id="v21-1-14-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a panic when attempting to access the hottest ranges (e.g., via the `/_status/hotranges` endpoint) before initial statistics had been gathered. [#74514][#74514]
- Servers no longer crash due to panics in HTTP handlers. [#74533][#74533]
- Previously, running [`IMPORT TABLE ... PGDUMP DATA`](../v21.1/import.html) with a [`COPY FROM`](../v21.1/copy-from.html) statement in the dump file that had fewer target columns than the inline table definition would result in a nil pointer exception. This is now fixed. [#74452][#74452]
- Previously, a doubly nested [`ENUM`](../v21.1/enum.html) in a DistSQL query would not be hydrated on remote nodes, resulting in panic. This is now fixed. [#74527][#74527]
- Error messages produced during [import](../v21.1/import.html) are now truncated. Previously, import could potentially generate large error messages that could not be persisted to the jobs table, resulting in a failed import never entering the failed state and instead retrying repeatedly. [#73335][#73335]
- Fixed a bug where deleting data via schema changes (e.g., when dropping an index or table) could fail with a `command too large` error. [#74797][#74797]
- Fixed panics that were possible in some distributed queries using [`ENUM`](../v21.1/enum.html)s in join predicates. [#75086][#75086]
- Fixed a bug which caused errors in rare cases when trying to divide [`INTERVAL`](../v21.1/interval.html) values by `INT4` or `INT2` values. [#75091][#75091]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors when altering the primary key of a table. The bug was only present if the table had a partial index with a predicate that referenced a virtual computed column. This bug was present since virtual computed columns were added in v21.1.0. [#75193][#75193]
- Fixed a bug that could occur when a [`TIMETZ`](../v21.1/time.html) column was indexed, and a query predicate constrained that column using a `<` or `>` operator with a `TIMETZ` constant. If the column contained values with time zones that did not match the time zone of the `TIMETZ` constant, it was possible that not all matching values could be returned by the query. Specifically, the results may not have included values within one microsecond of the predicate's absolute time. This bug was introduced when the `TIMETZ` datatype was first added in v20.1. It exists on all releases of v20.1, v20.2, v21.1, and v21.2 prior to this patch. [#75173][#75173]
- Fixed an internal error, `estimated row count must be non-zero`, that could occur during planning for queries over a table with a [`TIMETZ`](../v21.1/time.html) column. This error was due to a faulty assumption in the statistics estimation code about ordering of `TIMETZ` values, which has now been fixed. The error could occur when `TIMETZ` values used in the query had a different time zone offset than the `TIMETZ` values stored in the table. [#75173][#75173]
- Previously, during [restore](../v21.1/restore.html), CockroachDB would not insert a `system.namespace` entry for synthetic public schemas. This is now fixed. [#74760][#74760]
- [`RESTORE ... FROM LATEST IN`](../v21.1/restore.html) now works to restore the latest backup from a collection without needing to first inspect the collection to supply its actual path. [#75437][#75437]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors in queries with set operations, like `UNION`, when corresponding columns on either side of the set operation were not the same. This error only occurred with a limited set of types. This bug is present in v20.2.6+, v21.1.0+, and v21.2.0+. [#75294][#75294]
- The `CancelSession` endpoint now correctly propagates gateway metadata when forwarding requests. [#75886][#75886]
