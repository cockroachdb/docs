- Added the `--log-config-vars` flag to the [`cockroach` CLI](../v21.1/cockroach-commands.html), which allows for environment variables to be specified for expansion within the logging configuration file. This change allows for a single logging configuration file to service an array of sinks without further manipulation of the configuration file. [#85173][#85173]
