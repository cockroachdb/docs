## v21.1.6

Release Date: July 20, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-6-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Switched the `release-21.1` branch to point to a fork of the Google Cloud SDK at version 0.45.1 with an [upstream bug fix](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/pull/4226). [#66808][#66808]

<h3 id="v21-1-6-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Improved the internal buffering of [changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) to be robust to bursts in traffic which exceed the throughput to the sink. [#67205][#67205]
- [Incremental backups](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups) to a cloud storage location that already contains large existing backups now find their derived destination without listing as many remote files. [#67286][#67286]

<h3 id="v21-1-6-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added logs for important events during the server draining/shutdown process: (1) log when the server closes an existing connection while draining, (2) log when the server rejects a new connection while draining, and (3) log when the server cancels in-flight queries after waiting for the [`server.shutdown.query_wait`](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) duration to elapse while draining. [#66874][#66874] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-6-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug preventing the [Custom Chart debug page](../v21.1/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html) from loading on initial. [#66897][#66897]
- Added a drag-to-select timescale feature to the [Custom Chart debug page](../v21.1/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html). [#66594][#66594] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB now allows a node with lease preferences to drain gracefully. [#66712][#66712]
- Fixed a panic that could occur in the [optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) when executing a prepared plan with placeholders. This could happen when one of the tables used by the query had computed columns or a partial index. [#66833][#66833]
- Fixed a bug that caused graceful drain to call `time.sleep` multiple times, which cut into time needed for range lease transfers. [#66851][#66851]
- Reduced CPU usage of idle `cockroach` processes. [#66894][#66894]
- Fixed an error that backup would produce in some [full backups with revision history](../v21.1/take-backups-with-revision-history-and-restore-from-a-point-in-time.html). Previously, some full backups would erroneously produce an error in the form of `batch timestamp <some_timestamp> must be after replica GC threshold <some_other_timestamp>`. [#66904][#66904]
- CockroachDB now avoids interacting with [decommissioned nodes](../v21.1/remove-nodes.html#how-it-works) during DistSQL planning and consistency checking. [#66950][#66950]
- [Changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) no longer interact poorly with large, abandoned transactions. Previously, this combination could result in a cascade of work during transaction cleanup that could starve out foreground traffic. [#66813][#66813]
- [Changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) now properly invalidate cached range descriptors and retry when encountering [decommissioned nodes](../v21.1/remove-nodes.html#how-it-works). [#67013][#67013]
- Fixed a bug where [metrics pages](../v21.1/ui-overview-dashboard.html) would lose their scroll position on chart data updates. [#67089][#67089]
- Fixed a bug which caused internal errors when running an [`IMPORT TABLE`](../v21.1/import.html) statement with a virtual computed column to import a CSV file. This bug has been present since virtual computed columns were introduced in v21.1.0. [#67043][#67043]
- Previously, the CLI would attribute some of the time spent running schema changes to network latency. This has now been fixed. Additionally, verbose timings in the CLI now also show time spent running schema changes in a separate bucket. [#65719][#65719]
- Fixed a statement buffer memory leak when using suspended portals. [#67372][#67372]
- [Changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) on tables with array columns now support Avro. [#67433][#67433]
- Avro encoding now supports collated string types. [#67433][#67433]
- [`ENUM`](../v21.1/enum.html) columns can now be encoded in Avro [changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) [#67433][#67433]
- Avro [changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) now support `BIT` and `VARBIT` columns. [#67433][#67433]
- [`INTERVAL`](../v21.1/interval.html) columns are now supported in Avro [changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html). [#67433][#67433]

<h3 id="v21-1-6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- CockroachDB now continues to generate histograms when table statistics collection reaches memory limits, instead of disabling histogram generation. [#67057][#67057] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) now prefers performing a reverse scan over a forward scan + sort if the reverse scan eliminates the need for a sort and the plans are otherwise equivalent. This was previously the case in most cases, but some edge cases with a small number of rows have been fixed. [#67388][#67388]
- When choosing between index scans that are estimated to have the same number of rows, the [optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) now prefers indexes for which it has higher certainty about the maximum number of rows over indexes for which there is more uncertainty in the estimated row count. This helps to avoid choosing suboptimal plans for small tables or if the statistics are stale. [#67388][#67388]
