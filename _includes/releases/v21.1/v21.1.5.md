- Fixed a panic that could occur in the [optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) when executing a prepared plan with placeholders. This could happen when one of the tables used by the query had [computed columns](../v21.1/computed-columns.html) or a [partial index](../v21.1/partial-indexes.html). [#66883][#66883]
