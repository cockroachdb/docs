<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-5-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The internal representation of the `voter_constraints` [zone configuration](../v21.1/configure-replication-zones.html) attribute (new in v21.1) has been altered in a way that is partially incompatible with the representation used by previous v21.1 betas (and the alphas that include this attribute). This means that users who directly set the `voter_constraints` attribute to an empty list will lose those constraints and will have to reset them. [#63674][#63674] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-5-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Upgraded the CockroachDB binary to Go 1.15.10. [#63865][#63865] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-5-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- [Changefeeds](../v21.1/create-changefeed.html) will now fail on any [regional by row table](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) with an error, `CHANGEFEED cannot target REGIONAL BY ROW tables: <table_name>.` This is to prevent unexpected behavior in changefeeds until they offer full support for this type of table. [#63542][#63542] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`RESTORE`](../v21.1/restore.html) now re-validates restored indexes if they were restored from an [incremental backup](../v21.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups) that was taken while the index was being created. [#63320][#63320] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `sql.distsql.temp_storage.workmem` [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) is now marked as public and is included in the documentation. It determines how much RAM a single operation of a single query can use before it must spill to temporary storage. Note the operations that do not support the disk spilling will ignore this setting and are subject only to the [`--max-sql-memory`](../v21.1/cockroach-start.html#flags) startup argument. [#63997][#63997] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- SQL executor data validation queries spawned by a schema change or a [`RESTORE`](../v21.1/restore.html) will now use [vectorized](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html) query execution and [DistSQL](../v21.1/architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql) optimization if these are enabled in the [cluster settings](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) `sql.defaults.vectorize` and `sql.defaults.distsql`, respectively. This may improve the speed of these queries. [#64004][#64004] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Allow the leases of offline descriptors to be cached, preventing issues with lease acquisitions during bulk operations (backup and restore operations). [#63558][#63558]
- Fixed bugs where [`TRUNCATE`](../v21.1/truncate.html) concurrent with index construction and other schema changes could result in corruption. [#63143][#63143]
- Fixed a panic condition which could occur in cases after a [`RESTORE`](../v21.1/restore.html) of a table with [user-defined types](../v21.1/enum.html). [#63549][#63549]
- CockroachDB now prevents a panic condition and offers a graceful error when [spatial function](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) `ST_Segmentize` attempts to generate an extremely large number of points on a [`GEOGRAPHY`](../v21.1/spatial-glossary.html#geography). [#63758][#63758]
- Previously, running the `ST_Simplify` [spatial function](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) on a non-numeric value would cause the node to crash. This is now resolved. [#63797][#63797]
- CockroachDB now uses the existing primary key to validate indexes built for [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v21.1/alter-primary-key.html) changes. [#63609][#63609]
- Fixed occasional stalls and excessive CPU usage under macOS Big Sur when building CockroachDB with Go 1.14 or newer. [#63789][#63789]
- Fixed a bug where [crdb_internal.validate_multi_region_zone_configs()](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/generated/sql/functions.md#multi-region-functions) would fail during a [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v21.1/set-locality.html) locality transition. [#63834][#63834]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur when executing queries using a [GIN index](../v21.1/inverted-indexes.html). The error was an index out of range error, and could occur in rare cases when a filter or join predicate contained at least two JSON, Array, Geometry or Geography expressions that were combined with `AND`. This has now been fixed. [#63811][#63811]
- Fixed a bug leading to crashes with the error message `writing below closed ts`. [#63861][#63861]
- Previously, if a user altered a table to [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v21.1/set-locality.html) when a region was being dropped, and the drop failed and had to be rolled back, it could have resulted in the [regional by row table](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) missing a partition for this region. This is now fixed. [#63793][#63793]
- Prevent an internal error `use of enum metadata before hydration as an enum` when querying or showing ranges from tables with user-defined types as their `PRIMARY KEY`. [#63878][#63878]
- Fixed a theoretical issue in index backfills that could result in stale entries that would likely fail validation. [#64044][#64044]
- CockroachDB now correctly accounts for used memory when closing compressed files. [#63917][#63917]

<h3 id="v21-1-0-beta-5-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- CockroachDB now limits a series of heap allocations when serving read-only queries. [#63972][#63972]
- CockroachDB now limits the amount of memory that can be used in internal buffers for Kafka and cloud sinks. [#63611][#63611]
