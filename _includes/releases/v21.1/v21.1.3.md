## v21.1.3

Release Date: June 21, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Syntax errors in the host-based authentication (HBA) configuration in cluster setting `server.host_based_authentication.configuration` are now logged on the [OPS channel](../v21.1/logging.html). [#66128][#66128] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `User` and `ApplicationName` fields of structured events pertaining to SQL queries are now marked as non-sensitive when they contain certain values (`root`/`node` for `User` and values starting with `$` for application names). [#66443][#66443] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Changefeeds with custom Kafka client configurations (using the `kafka_sink_config` object) that could lead to long delays in flushing messages will now produce an error. [#66265][#66265] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `kafka_sink_config` object now supports a `version` configuration item to specify Kafka server versions. This is likely only necessary for old (Kafka 0.11/Confluent 3.3 or earlier) Kafka servers. Additionally, settings not specified in `kafka_sink_config` now retain their default values. [#66314][#66314] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`TRUNCATE`](../v21.1/truncate.html) is now less disruptive on tables with a large amount of concurrent traffic. [#65940][#65940] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Creating `STORED` or `VIRTUAL` [computed columns](../v21.1/computed-columns.html) with expressions that reference [foreign key](../v21.1/foreign-key.html) columns is now allowed. [#66168][#66168] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The new function [`crdb_internal.get_vmodule`](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html#system-info-functions) returns the current `vmodule` configuration on the node processing the request. [#63545][#63545] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The description string for the `random()` function now clarifies that there are at most 53 bits of randomness available; that is, the function is unsuitable to generate 64-bit random integer values. This behavior is similar to that of PostgreSQL. [#66128][#66128] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.1/explain-analyze.html) now displays information about the regions on which a statement was executed. [#66368][#66368] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a configurable limit to the number of intents collected by a `scan` before aborting, to prevent out-of-memory errors. The setting `storage.mvcc.max_intents_per_error` replaces `storage.sst_export.max_intents_per_error` and covers both `scan` and `export` commands. [#65923][#65923] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`BACKUP`](../v21.1/backup.html) now puts backup data files in a `data` sub-directory of the `BACKUP` path instead of directly in the backup path. [#66161][#66161] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The informational messages printed out when [`cockroach demo`](../v21.1/cockroach-demo.html) starts have been updated to clarify that certain information is only needed when accessing the demo cluster from another tool. [#66129][#66129] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`cockroach demo`](../v21.1/cockroach-demo.html) and [`cockroach sql`](../v21.1/cockroach-sql.html) are now able to run client-side commands via the `-e` command-line flag. This makes it possible to use commands like `\dt` or `\hf` from a shell script. [#66326][#66326] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Users can now reset SQL stats from the [DB Console](../v21.1/ui-overview.html). [#65916][#65916] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Removed shading on line graphs, improving legibility when viewing more than a few series on the same plot. [#66032][#66032] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Drag-to-zoom on metrics graphs now supports time ranges under 10 minutes. [#66032][#66032] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- In some cases, the Execution Stats page would show a very high Overhead latency for a statement. This could happen due to multiple statements being parsed together or due to statement execution being retried. To avoid this, we no longer consider the time between when parsing ends and execution begins when determining service latency. [#66108][#66108] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Improved the style of the password input field for Safari. [#66134][#66134]
- The metrics chart under Overview was renamed from `SQL Queries` to `SQL Statements` to match the naming used under SQL Metrics. [#66364][#66364] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v21-1-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug which prevented adding columns to tables which contain data and use `NOT NULL` virtual columns [#65973][#65973]
- Fixed a bug in the DB Console where graphs for clusters with decommissioned nodes could show an empty series and data could be incorrectly attributed to the wrong nodes. [#66032][#66032]
- Fixed a bug where queries on `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables could fail in the brief window in which a DROP REGION operation is in progress. [#65984][#65984]
- Fixed a bug where a schema's privilege descriptor could be corrupted upon executing `ALTER DATABASE ... CONVERT TO SCHEMA`, where privileges invalid on a schema were copied from the database, rendering the schema unusable. [#65993][#65993]
- Fixed the error classification for duplicate index names where the later index was a `UNIQUE` index. [#64000][#64000]
- Fixed the error classification for `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE` with the same name as an existing index. [#64000][#64000]
- Fixed a bug that made it less likely for range merges to succeed on clusters using multiple stores per node is now fixed. [#65889][#65889]
- Improved `TRUNCATE` operations to prevent contention issues. [#65940][#65940]
- Improved garbage collection of stale replicas by proactively checking certain replicas that have lost contact with other voting replicas. [#65186][#65186]
- Fixed a bug in `SHOW RANGES` which misattributed localities to nodes when using multiple stores. [#66037][#66037]
- Queries run through the `EXECUTE` statement can now generate statement diagnostic bundles as expected. [#66098][#66098]
- Previously, an `INSERT` causing a foreign key violation could result in an internal error in rare cases. The bug only affected the error response; any affected `INSERT`s (which would have been foreign-key violations) did not succeed. This bug, present since v21.1.0, has been fixed. [#66300][#66300]
- `BACKUP` and other operations can now reuse a previously created S3 client session when operating on the same bucket, which can avoid `NoCredentialProviders` errors on EC2 when iterating with large incremental backups. [#66259][#66259]
- The command exit status of `cockroach demo` and `cockroach sql` is now properly set to non-zero (error) after an error is encountered in a client-side command. Additionally, `cockroach sql` and `cockroach demo` now properly stop upon encountering an invalid configuration with `--set`, instead of starting to execute SQL statements after the invalid configuration. [#66326][#66326]
- Improved the availability of the jobs table for reads in large, global clusters by running background tasks at low priority. [#66344][#66344]
- Backups no longer risk the possibility of blocking conflicting writes while being rate limited by the `kv.bulk_io_write.concurrent_export_requests` concurrency limit. [#66408][#66408]
- The `soundex` and `st_difference` [built-in functions](../v21.1/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) for fuzzy string matching now correctly handle `NULL` values. [#66302][#66302]

<h3 id="v21-1-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Fixed an issue in the optimizer that prevented spatial predicates of the form `(column && value) = true` from being index-accelerated. These queries can now use a [spatial index](../v21.1/spatial-indexes.html) if one is available. [#65986][#65986]
- The optimizer is now more efficient when planning queries on tables that have many columns and indexes. [#66304][#66304]
- The `COCKROACHDB_REGISTRY` file is no longer rewritten whenever a new unencrypted file is created. [#66423][#66423] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- After improvements, queries use up to 1MB less system memory per scan, [lookup join, index join, zigzag join, or inverted join](../v21.1/joins.html) in their query plans. This will result in improved memory performance for workloads with concurrent OLAP-style queries. [#66145][#66145]
- Made improvements to prevent intra-query leaks during disk spilling that could cause the database to run out of memory, especially on tables with wide rows. [#66145][#66145]
