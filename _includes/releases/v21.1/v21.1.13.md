## v21.1.13

Release Date: January 10, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-1-13-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `"visible"` is now usable as a table or column name without extra quoting. [#72996][#72996]
- The `create_type_statements` table now has an index on `descriptor_id`. [#73672][#73672]
- Added a new `stmt` column to the `crdb_internal.(cluster|node)_distsql_flows` virtual table. This column is populated on a best-effort basis. [#73582][#73582]
- The [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) that controls the default value for the [session setting](../v21.1/set-vars.html) `reorder_joins_limit`, called `sql.defaults.reorder_joins_limit`, is now public and included in the docs. [#73891][#73891]
- Added escape character processing to constraint span generation. Previously, escaped-like lookups resulted in incorrect results. [#74258][#74258]

<h3 id="v21-1-13-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new `bulkio.ingest.flush_delay` cluster setting to act as a last-resort option to manually slow bulk-writing processes if needed for cluster stability. This should only be used if there is no better suited back-pressure mechanism available for the contended resource. [#73757][#73757]

<h3 id="v21-1-13-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed drag-to-zoom on custom charts. [#72589][#72589]
- Node events will now display a permission error rather than an internal server error when a user does not have admin privileges to view events. [#72464][#72464]
- The absolute links on the [Advanced Debug](../v21.1/ui-debug-pages.html) page within the DB Console have been updated to relative links. This will enable these links to work with the superuser dashboard in the Cloud Console. [#73122][#73122]

<h3 id="v21-1-13-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug which allowed [computed columns](../v21.1/computed-columns.html) to also have [`DEFAULT` expressions](../v21.1/default-value.html). [#73192][#73192]
- Fixed a bug causing [`RESTORE`](../v21.1/restore.html) to sometimes map OIDs to invalid types in certain circumstances containing user-defined types. [#73120][#73120]
- [`BACKUP WITH revision_history`](../v21.1/backup.html) would previously fail on an upgraded but un-finalized cluster. Now, it should succeed. [#73110][#73110]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to not set the `TableOID` and `TableAttributeNumber` attributes of `RowDescription` message of pgwire protocol in some cases (these values would be left as 0). [#72449][#72449]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to encounter an internal error or crash when some queries involving tuples with [`ENUM`](../v21.1/enum.html) values were executed in a distributed manner. [#72481][#72481]
- Fixed a bug causing usernames in [`ALTER TABLE ... OWNER TO`](../v21.1/alter-table.html) to not be normalized to lower case. [#72658][#72658]
- Previously, `atttypmod` in `pg_catalog.pg_attributes` for `DECIMAL` types with precision but no width was incorrectly "-1". This is now populated correctly. [#72075][#72075]
- Corrected how `type` displays for ZM shapes `geometry_columns` to match PostGIS output. This previously incorrectly included the Z/M lettering. [#71434][#71434]
- Corrected how `type` displays in `geography_columns` to better match PostGIS. This was previously in the wrong casing. [#71434][#71434]
- The `setval` built-in function previously did not invalidate cached sequence values. This is fixed now. [#71822][#71822]
- Fixed a bug preventing tuple type labels from being propagated across queries when run under DistSQL. [#70391][#70391]
- Fixed a bug whereby setting the `CACHE` for a sequence to 1 was ignored. Before this change [`ALTER SEQUENCE ... CACHE 1`](../v21.1/alter-sequence.html) would succeed but would not modify the cache value. [#71448][#71448]
- When using [`COPY FROM .. BINARY`](../v21.1/copy-from.html), the correct format code will now be returned. [#69255][#69255]
- Fixed a bug causing `COPY FROM ... BINARY` to return an error if the input data was split across different messages. [#69255][#69255]
- Fixed a bug causing `COPY FROM ... CSV` to require each `CopyData` message to be split at the boundary of a record. This was a bug since the `COPY` protocol allows messages to be split at arbitrary points. [#69255][#69255]
- Fixed a bug causing `COPY FROM ... CSV` to not correctly handle octal byte escape sequences such as `\011` when using a [`BYTEA`](../v21.1/bytes.html) column. [#69255][#69255]
- Manually enqueueing ranges via the DB Console will no longer crash nodes that contain an uninitialized replica for the enqueued range. [#73038][#73038]
- Fixed a crash with message "attempting to propose command writing below closed timestamp" that could occur, typically on overloaded systems experiencing non-cooperative lease transfers. [#73166][#73166]
- The `txnwaitqueue.pusher.waiting` metric no longer over-reports the number of pushing transactions in some cases. [#71743][#71743]
- Fixed a rare condition that could cause a range merge to get stuck waiting on itself. The symptom of this deadlock was a goroutine stuck in `handleMergeInProgressError` for tens of minutes. [#72049][#72049]
- Fixed bugs causing [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v21.1/create-table-as.html) and [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`](../v21.1/create-view.html) to panic if the `SELECT` query was an internal table requiring internal database state. [#73620][#73620]
- Fixed a rare internal error, "estimated row count must be non-zero", which could occur when planning queries using a GIN index. This error could occur if the histogram on the GIN index showed that there were no rows. [#73353][#73353]
- Fixed an internal error, "empty Datums being compared to other", that could occur during planning for some `SELECT` queries over tables that included a `DEFAULT` partition value in a `PARTITION BY LIST` clause. This bug had been present since 21.1.0. The bug does not exist on versions 20.2.x and earlier. [#73663][#73663]
- Fixed a bug in database and schema restore cleanup that resulted in a dangling descriptor entry on job failure. [#73412][#73412]
- Fixed a bug with the ungraceful shutdown of distributed queries in some rare cases. [#73959][#73959]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to return a spurious "context canceled" error for a query that actually succeeded in extremely rare cases. [#73959][#73959]
- Fixed a bug which caused corruption of [partial indexes](../v21.2/partial-indexes.html), which could cause incorrect query results. The bug was only present when two or more partial indexes in the same table had identical `WHERE` clauses. This bug had been present since version 21.1.0. [#74475][#74475]

<h3 id="v21-1-13-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.1/import.html) performance in cases where it encounters large numbers of unresolved write intents. [#72272][#72272]
- The performance of transaction deadlock detection is now more stable even with significant transaction contention. [#71743][#71743]
- Bulk ingestion of small write batches (e.g., index backfill into a large number of ranges) is now throttled, to avoid buildup of read amplification and associated performance degradation. Concurrency is controlled by the new cluster setting `kv.bulk_io_write.concurrent_addsstable_as_writes_requests`. [#74072][#74072]
