<h3 id="v21-2-15-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The CLI now contains a flag (`--log-config-vars`) that allows for environment variables to be specified for expansion within the logging configuration file. This allows a single logging configuration file to service an array of sinks without further manipulation of the configuration file. [#85172][#85172]
- [`cockroach debug zip`](../v21.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html) now includes all system tables by default, except for a few (a deny list). [#86142][#86142]

<h3 id="v21-2-15-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed incorrect error handling that could cause casts to OID types to fail in some cases. [#85125][#85125]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.2 that could cause a panic when an expression contained a geospatial comparison like `~` that was negated. [#84629][#84629]
- Nodes no longer gossip information about table statistics once all nodes in the cluster are upgraded to v21.2. [#85494][#85494]
- Fixed an error that could occur when a query included a limited reverse scan and some rows needed to be retrieved by `GET` requests. [#85583][#85583]
- Fixed a bug where clients could sometimes receive errors due to lease acquisition timeouts of the form `operation "storage.pendingLeaseRequest: requesting lease" timed out after 6s`. [#85429][#85429]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [union](../v21.2/selection-queries.html#union-combine-two-queries) queries to return incorrect results in rare cases. [#85653][#85653]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a panic in rare cases when the unnest() [function](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html) was used with a `tuple` return type.  [#85347][#85347]
- Fixed an issue where the `NO_INDEX_JOIN` hint could be ignored by the [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) in some cases, causing it to create a query plan with an index join. [#86089][#86089]
- Previously, an empty column in the input to `COPY ... FROM CSV` would be treated as an empty string. Now, this is treated as `NULL`. The quoted empty string can still be used to input an empty string. Similarly, if a different `NULL` token is specified in the command options, it can be quoted in order to be treated as the equivalent string value. [#86148][#86148]
