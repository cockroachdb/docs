{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}
During an upgrade of a CockroachDB cluster from v21.1.x â†’ v21.2.0, [backups](../v21.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) will fail until the upgrade is [finalized](../v21.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html#step-3-decide-how-the-upgrade-will-be-finalized). After the upgrade is complete and finalized, backups will continue as normal.

This issue will only occur if the upgrade coincides with a backup. For small clusters, where the upgrade is quick, there may be no overlap, and you will not experience this issue.

Version    | Feature                        | Description
-----------+--------------------------------+------------------------------
Enterprise | **Multi-region observability** | You can now surface region information by using the [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.2/explain-analyze.html) statements. This information is also now available in the [DB Console](#v21-2-0-multi-region-db-console).
Enterprise | **Restricted and default placement** | You can now use the [`ALTER DATABASE ... PLACEMENT RESTRICTED`](../v21.2/placement-restricted.html) statement to constrain the replica placement for a [multi-region database](../v21.2/multiregion-overview.html)'s [regional tables](../v21.2/regional-tables.html) to the [home regions](../v21.2/set-locality.html#crdb_region) associated with those tables.
Enterprise | **Bounded staleness reads**    | [Bounded staleness reads](../v21.2/follower-reads.html#bounded-staleness-reads) are now available in CockroachDB. These use a dynamic, system-determined timestamp to minimize staleness while being more tolerant to replication lag than exact staleness reads. This dynamic timestamp is returned by the `with_min_timestamp()` or `with_max_staleness()` [functions](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html). In addition, bounded staleness reads provide the ability to serve reads from local replicas even in the presence of [network partitions](../v21.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#network-partition) or other failures.
Core       | **Privilege inheritance**      | CockroachDB's model for inheritance of privileges that cascade from schema objects now matches PostgreSQL. Added support for [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](../v21.2/alter-default-privileges.html) and [`SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](../v21.2/show-default-privileges.html).
Core       | **`ON UPDATE` expressions**    | An [`ON UPDATE` expression](../v21.2/add-column.html#add-a-column-with-an-on-update-expression) can now be added to a column to update column values when an [`UPDATE`](../v21.2/update.html) or [`UPSERT`](../v21.2/upsert.html) statement modifies a different column value in the same row, or when an `ON UPDATE CASCADE` expression on a different column modifies an existing value in the same row.
Core       | **More granular controls for session variables** | There are now more ways to control CockroachDB's behavior through [session variables](../v21.2/set-vars.html). You can now set user or role-level defaults by using the [`ALTER ROLE`](../v21.2/alter-role.html) statement. CockroachDB also now supports setting session variables for the duration of a single transaction, using [the `LOCAL` keyword](../v21.2/set-vars.html#set-local).
Core       | **Transaction guardrails**     | [Transaction guardrails](../v21.2/transactions.html#limit-the-number-of-rows-written-or-read-in-a-transaction) have been added to CockroachDB to improve production stability. These can help prevent cluster unavailability and protect the cluster against multiple developer workloads with problematic SQL statements.
Core       | **Expression indexes**         | [Indexes on expressions](../v21.2/expression-indexes.html) can now be created. These indexes speed up queries that filter on the result of that expression, and are especially useful for indexing only a specific field of a `JSON` object.
Core       | **Correlated CTEs**            | [Correlated common table expressions](../v21.2/common-table-expressions.html#correlated-common-table-expressions) (CTEs) are now supported in CockroachDB. A correlated CTE is a common table expression that is contained in a subquery and references columns defined outside of the subquery.
Core       | **Admission control**          | A new [admission control system](../v21.2/architecture/admission-control.html) has been added. CockroachDB implements this optional admission control system to maintain cluster performance and availability when some nodes experience high load. Admission control is disabled by default.<br><br>Additionally, an [**Overload** dashboard](../v21.2/ui-overload-dashboard.html) has been added to the DB Console. Use this dashboard to monitor the performance of the parts of your cluster relevant to the cluster's [admission control system](../v21.2/architecture/admission-control.html). This includes CPU usage, the runnable goroutines waiting per CPU, the health of the persistent stores, and the performance of admission control system when it is enabled.
Core       | **Persistent statement and transaction statistics** | Statistics information on the [**Statements**](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html) and [**Transactions**](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html) pages within the DB Console can now be persisted for longer than one hour.
Core       | **Index usage statistics**     | Index usage statistics are now supported for CockroachDB to help [identify unused indexes](../v21.2/performance-recipes.html#slow-writes) causing unnecessary performance overhead for your workload. Index read statistics are available in the [`crdb_internal` schema](../v21.2/crdb-internal.html#tables) for programmatic access using SQL.
Core       | **Third-party tool support**   | [Sequelize](../v21.2/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb-sequelize.html), a Javascript object-relational mapper (ORM), and [Alembic](../v21.2/alembic.html), a schema migration tool for SQLAlchemy users, are now fully supported. We have also improved testing for [PgBouncer](https://dzone.com/articles/using-pgbouncer-with-cockroachdb), an external connection pooler for PostgreSQL.
Core       | **Contention views**           | You can now use pre-built contention views in [`crdb_internal`](../v21.2/crdb-internal.html#tables) to quickly identify the top contending indexes. These views can be used to [understand where and avoid contention](../v21.2/performance-best-practices-overview.html#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) happening in your workload.

-----------+-----------------------------------------------+------------
{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} | **`BACKUP` / `RESTORE` scalability**          | [`BACKUP`](../v21.2/backup.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v21.2/restore.html) performance has been improved for larger data volumes, more frequent backups, and clusters with more or larger nodes.
{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} | **Webhook changefeed sink** | You can now stream individual [changefeed](../v21.2/create-changefeed.html) messages as webhook messages to a newly supported [`webhook-https` sink](../v21.2/changefeed-sinks.html#webhook-sink). The webhook sink is a flexible, general-purpose sink solution that does not require managing a Kafka cluster or cloud storage sink.
{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} | **Multi-region bulk operations improvements** | The following bulk operations are now supported: <ul><li>[`RESTORE`](../v21.2/restore.html) on [`REGIONAL BY TABLE`](../v21.2/multiregion-overview.html#regional-tables) and [`GLOBAL`](../v21.2/set-locality.html#global) tables is supported with some limitations. For more details, see [Restoring to multi-region databases](../v21.2/restore.html#restoring-to-multi-region-databases).</li><li>[`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.2/import-into.html) now supports importing into [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v21.2/set-locality.html#regional-by-row) tables.</li></ul>

-----------+----------------------------------------+------------
Enterprise | **Kubernetes Operator on Amazon EKS**  | The Kubernetes Operator is now supported on [Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)](../v21.2/deploy-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html#hosted-eks).
Enterprise | **Extend the Kubernetes Operator API** | The [Kubernetes Operator API has been extended](../v21.2/schedule-cockroachdb-kubernetes.html) to a state where it can support the various types of single-region deployments the Helm chart currently supports. This includes: <ul><li>Node affinity</li><li>Pod affinity and anti-affinity</li><li>Taints and tolerations</li><li>Custom labels and annotations</li><ul>
Enterprise | <a name="v21-2-0-multi-region-db-console">**Multi-region in the DB Console** | The DB Console now surfaces multi-region information to provide observability into global databases and their workloads. You can view multi-region details on the [**Databases**](../v21.2/ui-databases-page.html), [**Statements**](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html), and [**Transactions**](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html) pages.
Core       | **Automatic ballast files**            | CockroachDB now automatically creates an emergency ballast file at startup time.  The `cockroach debug ballast` command is still available but deprecated. For more information about how automatic ballast file creation works, see [automatic ballast files](../v21.2/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html#automatic-ballast-files).

<h4 id="v21-2-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v21.2](../v21.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- Interleaved tables and interleaved indexes have been removed. Before upgrading to v21.2, [convert interleaved tables](../v21.1/interleave-in-parent.html#convert-interleaved-tables) and [replace interleaved indexes](../v21.1/interleave-in-parent.html#replace-interleaved-indexes). Clusters with interleaved tables and indexes cannot finalize the v21.2 upgrade.
- Previously, CockroachDB only supported the YMD format for parsing timestamps from strings. It now also supports the MDY format to better align with PostgreSQL. A timestamp such as `1-1-18`, which was previously interpreted as `2001-01-18`, will now be interpreted as `2018-01-01`. To continue interpreting the timestamp in the YMD format, the first number can be represented with 4 digits, `2001-1-18`.
- The deprecated [cluster setting](../v21.2/cluster-settings.html) `cloudstorage.gs.default.key` has been removed, and the behavior of the `AUTH` parameter in Google Cloud Storage [`BACKUP`](../v21.2/backup.html) and `IMPORT` URIs has been changed. The default behavior is now that of `AUTH=specified`, which uses the credentials passed in the `CREDENTIALS` parameter, and the previous default behavior of using the node's implicit access (via its machine account or role) now requires explicitly passing `AUTH=implicit`.
- Switched types from `TEXT` to `"char"` for compatibility with PostgreSQL in the following columns: `pg_constraint` (`confdeltype`, `confmatchtype`, `confudptype`, `contype`) `pg_operator` (`oprkind`), `pg_prog` (`proargmodes`), `pg_rewrite` (`ev_enabled`, `ev_type`), and `pg_trigger` (`tgenabled`).

<h4 id="v21-2-0-deprecations">Deprecations</h4>

- The `kv.closed_timestamp.closed_fraction` and `kv.follower_read.target_multiple` [settings](../v21.2/cluster-settings.html) are now deprecated and turned into no-ops. They had already stopped controlling the closing of timestamps in v21.1, but were still influencing the [`follower_read_timestamp()`](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html) computation for a timestamp that is likely to be closed on all followers. To replace them, a simpler `kv.closed_timestamp.propagation_slack` setting is introduced, modeling the delay between when a leaseholder closes a timestamp and when all the followers become aware of it (defaults conservatively to 1s). `follower_read_timestamp()` is now computed as `kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration` + `kv.closed_timestamp.side_transport_interval` + `kv.closed_timestamp.propagation_slack`, which defaults to 4.2s (instead of the previous default of 4.8s).
- Because the [`SELECT`](../v21.2/security-reference/authorization.html#privileges) database privilege is being deprecated, CockroachDB now additionally checks for the [`CONNECT`](../v21.2/security-reference/authorization.html#privileges) privilege on the database to allow for backing up the database. Existing users with `SELECT` on the database can still back up the database, but it is now recommended to [`GRANT`](../v21.2/grant.html) `CONNECT` on the database.
- [`IMPORT TABLE`](../v21.2/import.html) will be deprecated in v21.2 and removed in a future release. Users should create a table using [`CREATE TABLE`](../v21.2/create-table.html) and then [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.2/import-into.html) the newly created table.
- Granting `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` on databases is being deprecated. The syntax is still supported, but is automatically converted to the equivalent `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES` command. The user is given a notice that the privilege is incompatible and automatically being converted to an `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGE FOR ALL ROLES` command.
