## v21.2.9

Release Date: April 13, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-2-9-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v21.2/show-backup.html) now reports accurate row and byte size counts on backups created by a tenant. [#79347][#79347]
- [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.2/explain-analyze.html) now reports memory and disk usage for lookup joins. [#79353][#79353]

<h3 id="v21-2-9-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new metric that charts the number of bytes received via [snapshot](../v21.2/ui-replication-dashboard.html#snapshots) on any given store. [#79056][#79056]

<h3 id="v21-2-9-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Minor styling changes on the DB Console's [Hot Ranges page](../v21.2/ui-hot-ranges-page.html) to follow the same style as other pages. [#79498][#79498]

<h3 id="v21-2-9-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed [`num_runs`](../v21.2/show-jobs.html) being incremented twice for certain jobs upon being started. [#79051][#79051]
- Index usage stats are now properly captured for index joins. [#79240][#79240]
- [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v21.2/alter-table.html) and [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](../v21.2/alter-table.html) are now both subject to [admission control](../v21.2/architecture/admission-control.html), which will prevent these operations from overloading the storage engine. [#79211][#79211]
- Fixed a performance regression released in v21.1.7 that reverted [`BACKUP`](../v21.2/backup.html) to its pre-v21.2.5 memory usage and runtime during planning of larger backups with many prior incremental layers. [#79267][#79267]
- Fixed a bug where [`SHOW SCHEMAS FROM <schema>`](../v21.2/show-schemas.html) would not include user-defined schemas. [#79307][#79307]
- Previously, [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.2/import-into.html) could create duplicate entries for [`UNIQUE`](../v21.2/unique.html) constraints in [`REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v21.2/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) tables and tables utilizing `UNIQUE WITHOUT INDEX` constraints. This fix introduces a new validation step after the `IMPORT INTO` for those tables, which will cause the `IMPORT INTO` to fail and be rolled back in such cases. [#79326][#79326]
- Fixed a bug in I/O [admission control](../v21.2/architecture/admission-control.html) that could result in admission control failing to rate-limit when traffic was stalled such that no work was admitted, despite the store's being in an unhealthy state. [#79342][#79342]
- Previously, CockroachDB could run into `memory budget exceeded` errors when performing [lookup joins](../v21.2/joins.html#lookup-joins) under certain memory conditions. This fix causes such operations to now more reliably [spill to disk](../v21.2/vectorized-execution.html#disk-spilling-operations), which should reduce these errors for larger joins. [#79353][#79353]
- [`BACKUP`](../v21.2/backup.html) read requests are now sent with lower [admission control](../v21.2/architecture/admission-control.html) priority than normal traffic.[#79367][#79367]
- Previously, [`LIMIT`](../v21.2/limit-offset.html) queries with an [`ORDER BY`](../v21.2/order-by.html) clause which scan the index of virtual system tables, such as `pg_type`, could return incorrect results. This is corrected by teaching the [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) that `LIMIT` operations cannot be pushed into ordered scans of virtual indexes. [#79464][#79464]
- Fixed a bug that caused the [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to generate query plans with logically incorrect lookup joins. The bug, present since v21.2.0, can only occur in queries with an inner join, e.g., `t1 JOIN t2`, if all of the following are true:
    - The join contains an equality condition between columns of both tables, e.g., `t1.a = t2.a`.
    - A query filter or [`CHECK`](../v21.2/check.html) constraint constrains a column to a set of specific values, e.g., `t2.b IN (1, 2, 3)`. In the case of a `CHECK` constraint, the column must be `NOT NULL`.
    - A query filter or `CHECK` constraint constrains a column to a range, e.g., `t2.c > 0`. In the case of a `CHECK` constraint, the column must be `NOT NULL`.
    - An index contains a column from each of the criteria above, e.g., `INDEX t2(a, b, c)`. [#79505][#79505]
- Fixed a bug that caused the [optimizer](../v21.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to generate invalid query plans that could result in incorrect query results. The bug, present since version v21.1.0, can appear if all of the following conditions are true:
    - The query contains a semi-join, e.g., with the format `SELECT * FROM a WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM b WHERE a.a @> b.b)`.
    - The inner table has a multi-column [inverted index](../v21.2/inverted-indexes.html) containing the inverted column in the filter.
    - The index prefix columns are constrained to a set of values via the filter or a [`CHECK`](../v21.2/check.html) constraint, e.g., with an `IN` operator. In the case of a `CHECK` constraint, the column is `NOT NULL`. [#79505][#79505]
- Fixed a bug preventing DB Console from properly loading static assets, causing the interface to appear blank. [#79662][#79662]
