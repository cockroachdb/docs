Release Date: May 2, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-2-10-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The `crdb_internal.reset_sql_stats()` and `crdb_internal.reset_index_usage_stats()` [built-in functions](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html#system-info-functions) now check if user has the [admin role](../v21.2/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). [#80277][#80277]

<h3 id="v21-2-10-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Added a `changefeed.backfill.scan_request_size` [cluster setting](../v21.2/cluster-settings.html) to control scan request size during [backfill](../v21.2/use-changefeeds.html#schema-changes-with-column-backfill). [#79709][#79709]

<h3 id="v21-2-10-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- A `pgerror` with code `22P02` is now returned when an invalid cast to `OID` is made. [#79849][#79849]
- An incremental [backup](../v21.2/backup.html) now fails if the `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` is less than the previous backup's end time. [#80287][#80287]

<h3 id="v21-2-10-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Filtering by column is added to [**Hot Ranges**](../v21.2/ui-hot-ranges-page.html) page. [#79645][#79645]
- Added dropdown filter on the Node Diagnostics page to view by active, decommissioned, or all nodes. [#80336][#80336]

<h3 id="v21-2-10-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The execution time as reported on `DISTSQL` diagrams within the statement bundle collected via [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`](../v21.2/explain-analyze.html#explain-analyze-debug) is no longer negative when the statement encountered an error. [#79369][#79369]
- An internal error when the inner expression of a column access expression evaluated to `NULL` no longer occurs. For example, evaluation of the expression `(CASE WHEN b THEN ((ROW(1) AS a)) ELSE NULL END).a` would error when `b` is `false`. [#79528][#79528]
- An error when accessing a named column of a labelled tuple no longer occurs. The error occurred when an expression could produce one of several different tuples. For example, `(CASE WHEN true THEN (ROW(1) AS a) ELSE (ROW(2) AS a) END).a` would fail to evaluate. [#79528][#79528]
- [Pebble](../v21.2/architecture/storage-layer.html#pebble) compaction heuristics no longer allow a large compaction backlog to accumulate, eventually triggering high read amplification. [#79611][#79611]
- HTTP 304 responses no longer result in error logs. [#79860][#79860]
- A custom time series metric `sql.distsql.queries.spilled` is no longer computed incorrectly leading to an exaggerated number. [#79881][#79881]
- [`nextval` and `setval`](../v21.2/create-sequence.html#sequence-functions) are non-transactional except when they is called in the same transaction that the sequence was created in. Creating a sequence and calling `nextval` or `setval` on it within a transaction no longer causes the query containing `nextval` to hang. [#79866][#79866]
- The [SQL Activity](../v21.2/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) page no longer returns a "descriptor not found" error in a v21.1-v21.2 mixed version state. [#79795][#79795]
- [Resetting SQL statistics](../v21.2/ui-statements-page.html#statement-statistics) in v21.1-v21.2 mixed version state no longer causes a "descriptor not found" error. [#79795][#79795]
- In a v21.1-v21.2 mixed version state CockroachDB no longer attempts to flush statistics to disk. It also does not log a "descriptor not found" error messages. [#79795][#79795]
- Added a detailed error message for index out of bounds when decoding a [binary tuple](../v21.2/scalar-expressions.html#tuple-constructors) datum. [#79963][#79963]
- CockroachDB no longer encounters an internal error when evaluating queries with [`OFFSET`](../v21.2/limit-offset.html) and [`LIMIT`](../v21.2/limit-offset.html) clauses when the addition of the `offset` and the `limit` value would be larger than `int64` range. [#79924][#79924]
- Automatic [encryption-at-rest data key rotation](../v21.2/security-reference/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise) is no longer disabled after a node restart without a store key rotation. [#80170][#80170]
- When using `ST_Intersects`, `ST_Within`, or `ST_Covers` [spatial functions](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions), `NaN` coordinates no longer return `true` for point in polygon operations. [#80201][#80201]
- [`ST_MinimumBoundingCircle`](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) no longer panics with infinite coordinates and a `num_segs` argument. [#80346][#80346]
- The formatting/printing behavior for [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](../v21.2/alter-default-privileges.html) was fixed, which corrects some mistaken error messages. [#80326][#80326]
- Bulk data sent to the [KV storage layer](../v21.2/architecture/storage-layer.html) is now sent at reduced [admission control](../v21.2/architecture/admission-control.html) priority. [#80387][#80387]

<h3 id="v21-2-10-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Rollback of [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v21.2/create-table-as.html) with large quantities of data now has similar performance to [`DROP TABLE`](../v21.2/drop-table.html). [#79603][#79603]
