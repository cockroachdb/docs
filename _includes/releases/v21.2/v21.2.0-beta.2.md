## v21.2.0-beta.2

Release Date: September 27, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-2-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- SQL tenant servers will now use a TLS certificate for their HTTP server when it's present. Previously this server never used TLS. [#70056][#70056]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The query logging enabled by `sql.telemetry.query_sampling.enabled` now avoids considering SQL statements issued internally by CockroachDB itself. [#70358][#70358]
- [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.2/import-into.html) now supports UDT for default and computed columns. [#70270][#70270]
- [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.2/import-into.html) [regional by row](../v21.2/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) tables is now supported. [#70270][#70270]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The meaning of the recently introduced `transaction_rows_written_err` and `transaction_rows_read_err` (as well as the corresponding `_log` variables) have been adjusted to indicate the largest number of rows that is still allowed. In other words, originally reaching the limit would result in an error, and now only exceeding the limit would. [#70014][#70014]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-2-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- It is now possible to mix and match severity filters for different channels on a single log sink. For example:

    ~~~
    file-groups:    monitoring:      channels: {WARNING: [OPS, STORAGE], INFO: HEALTH}
    ~~~

    This defines a single file sink "monitoring" which captures all messages from the `HEALTH` channel, and only messages at severity `WARNING` or higher from the `OPS` and `STORAGE` channels.

    Another example:

    ~~~
    file-groups:    default:       channels: {INFO: all except STORAGE, WARNING: STORAGE}
    ~~~

    This captures all messages on all channels except the `STORAGE` channel, plus the messages at severity `WARNING` or higher from `STORAGE`.  Note: the previous syntax remains supported. When `channel` is specified without explicit severities, the `filter` attribute is used as the default (like previously). [#70411][#70411]

- The default logging configuration now redirects the `HEALTH` logging channel to a distinct log file (`cockroach-health.log`). [#70411][#70411]
- The default logging configuration now redirects the output on the `SQL_SCHEMA` channel to a new separate file group `sql-schema` (`cockroach-sql-schema.log`), and the `PRIVILEGES` and `USER_ADMIN` channels to a new separate file group `security` (`cockroach-security.log`). The new `security` group has the `auditable` flag set. As previously, the administrator can inspect the default configuration with `cockroach debug check-log-config`. [#70411][#70411]
- The server logging configuration now also includes a copy of messages from all logging channels at severity `WARNING` or higher into the default log file. This ensures that severe messages from all channels are also included in the main log file used during troubleshooting. [#70411][#70411]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added tooltips on the [**Databases** page](../v21.2/ui-databases-page.html) and made the SQL box scrollable. [#70070][#70070]
- Added a column selector to the [**Transactions** page](../v21.2/ui-transactions-page.html). [#70286][#70286]
- Updated the [Jobs table](../v21.2/ui-jobs-page.html#jobs-list) style to match all other tables on the Console and also updated the column name from `Users` to `User`. [#70449][#70449]

<h3 id="v21-2-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Columns that were hidden by default were not being displayed when selected. This commit fixes the behavior. [#70054][#70054]
- Fixed all broken links to documentation. [#70063][#70063]
- Temporary tables were not properly cleaned up for tenants. This is now fixed. [#70129][#70129]
- DNS unavailability during range 1 leaseholder loss will no longer cause significant latency increases for queries and other operations. [#70135][#70135]
- Last Execution Timestamp is now properly updating. [#70297][#70297]
- Fixed a bug in full cluster restores where dropped descriptor revisions would cause the [restore](../v21.2/restore.html) to fail. [#70368][#70368]
- Default columns were displayed on the [**Statements** page](../cockroachcloud/statements-page.html) on the CockroachCloud console when the user never made any selection. This is now fixed. [#70206][#70206]
- `cockroach mt start-proxy` now appropriately sets the .ServerName member of outgoing TLS connections. This allows the proxy to function appropriately when the `--insecure` and `--skip-verify` CLI flags are omitted. [#70290][#70290]
