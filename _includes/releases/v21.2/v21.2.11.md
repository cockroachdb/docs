<h3 id="v21-2-11-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where [backups](../v21.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) in the base directory of a Google Storage bucket would not be discovered by `SHOW BACKUPS`. These backups will now appear correctly. [#80510][#80510]

<h3 id="v21-2-11-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- When using Azure Cloud Storage for data operations, CockroachDB now calculates the Storage Account URL from the provided `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` query parameter. This defaults to `AzurePublicCloud` if not specified to maintain backwards compatibility. This parameter should not be used when the cluster is in a mixed version or upgrading state, as nodes that have not been upgraded will continue to send requests to the `AzurePublicCloud` even in the presence of this parameter. [#80800][#80800]
- Added a new [session variable](../v21.2/set-vars.html#supported-variables), `enable_multiple_modifications_of_table`, which can be used instead of the cluster variable `sql.multiple_modifications_of_table.enabled` to allow statements containing multiple [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](../v21.2/insert.html#on-conflict-clause), [`UPSERT`](../v21.2/upsert.html), [`UPDATE`](../v21.2/update.html), or [`DELETE`](../v21.2/delete.html) subqueries to modify the same table. The underlying issue [#70731](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/70731) is not fixed: table corruption remains possible if the same row is modified multiple times by different subqueries of a single statement, regardless of the value of the new `enable_multiple_modifications_of_table` session variable or the existing `sql.multiple_modifications_of_table.enabled` cluster variable. Cockroach Labs recommends rewriting these statements, but the session variable is provided as an aid if this is not possible. [#81016][#81016]

<h3 id="v21-2-11-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added an alert banner on the [Overview](../v21.2/ui-overview.html) list page to warn users when staggered node versions are detected in a cluster. [#80742][#80742]

<h3 id="v21-2-11-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare crash which can occur when [restarting a node](../v21.2/cockroach-start.html) after [dropping tables](../v21.2/drop-table.html). [#80571][#80571]
- Fixed a bug where in very rare circumstances CockroachDB could incorrectly evaluate queries with [`ORDER BY`](../v21.2/order-by.html) clauses when the prefix of ordering was already provided by the index ordering of the scanned table. [#80731][#80731]
- The list of recently decommissioned nodes and the historical list of decommissioned nodes now correctly displays decommissioned nodes. [#80747][#80747]
- Fixed a goroutine leak when internal [rangefeed](../v21.2/use-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) clients received certain kinds of retryable errors. [#80797][#80797]
- Fixed a bug in which some prepared statements could result in incorrect results when executed. This could occur when the prepared statement included an equality comparison between an [index column](../v21.2/schema-design-indexes.html) and a placeholder, and the placeholder was cast to a [type](../v21.2/data-types.html) that was different from the column type. For example, if column a was of type [`DECIMAL`](../v21.2/decimal.html), the following prepared query could produce incorrect results when executed: `SELECT * FROM t_dec WHERE a = $1::INT8;` [#81364][#81364]
