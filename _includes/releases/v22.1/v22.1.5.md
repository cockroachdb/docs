<h3 id="v22-1-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v22.1/as-of-system-time.html) now takes the time zone into account when converting to UTC. For example: `2022-01-01 08:00:00-04:00` is now treated the same as `2022-01-01 12:00:00` instead of being interpreted as `2022-01-01 08:00:00` [#84663][#84663]

<h3 id="v22-1-5-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Updated labels from "date range" to "time interval" on time picker (custom option, preset title, previous and next arrows) [#84517][#84517]
- Removed `View Statement Details` link inside the [**Session Details**](../v22.1/ui-sessions-page.html) page. [#84502][#84502]
- Updated the message when there is no data on the selected time interval on the [**Statements**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html) and [**Transactions**](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html) pages. [#84623][#84623]

<h3 id="v22-1-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a conversion on the jobs endpoint, so that the [**Jobs**](../v22.1/ui-jobs-page.html) page won't return a `500` error when a job contained an error with quotes. [#84464][#84464]
- The 'Parse', 'Bind', and 'Execute' `pgwire` commands now return an error if they are used during an aborted transaction. [`COMMIT`](../v22.1/commit-transaction.html) and [`ROLLBACK`](../v22.1/rollback-transaction.html) statements are still allowed during an aborted transaction. [#84329][#84329]
- Sorting on the plans table inside the [**Statement Details**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) page is now properly working. [#84627][#84627]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [unique indexes](../v22.1/unique.html) to be unexpectedly dropped after running an [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v22.1/alter-primary-key.html) statement, if the new PK column set is a subset of the old PK column set.[#84570][#84570]
- Fixed a bug where some statements in a batch would not get executed if the following conditions were met:
  - A batch of statements is sent in a single string.
  - A [`BEGIN`](../v22.1/begin-transaction.html) statement appears in the middle of the batch.
  - The `enable_implicit_transaction_for_batch_statements` [session variable](../v22.1/set-vars.html) is set to `true`. (This defaults to false in v22.1)
  This bug was introduced in v22.1.2. [#84593][#84593]
- Previously, CockroachDB could deadlock when evaluating analytical queries if multiple queries had to [spill to disk](../v22.1/vectorized-execution.html#disk-spilling-operations) at the same time. This is now fixed by making some of the queries error out instead. If you know that there is no deadlock and that some analytical queries that have spilled are just taking too long, blocking other queries from spilling, you can adjust newly introduced `sql.distsql.acquire_vec_fds.max_retries` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) (use `0` to enable the previous behavior of indefinite waiting until spilling resources open up). [#84657][#84657]
- Fixes a bug where cluster restores of older backups would silently clobber system tables or fail to complete. [#84904][#84904]
- Fixed a bug that was introduced in v21.2 that could cause increased memory usage when scanning a table with wide rows. [#83966][#83966]
- Fixed a bug in the `concat` projection operator on arrays that gave output of nulls when the projection operator can actually handle null arguments and may result in a non-null output. [#84615][#84615]
- Reduced foreground latency impact when performing changefeed backfills by adjusting `changefeed.memory.per_changefeed_limit` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) to 128MiB (Enterprise only). [#84702][#84702]

<h3 id="v22-1-5-known-limitations">Known limitations</h3>

- A performance regression exists for v22.1.4 and v22.1.5 that causes [DB Console Metrics pages](../v21.2/ui-overview-dashboard.html) to fail to load, or to load slower than expected, when attempting to display metrics graphs. This regression is fixed in CockroachDB v22.1.6. [#85636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/85636)
