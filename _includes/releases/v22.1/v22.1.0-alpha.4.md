## v22.1.0-alpha.4

Release Date: March 21, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Clusters can be configured to send HSTS headers with HTTP requests in order to enable browser-level enforcement of HTTPS for the cluster host. This is controlled by setting the `server.hsts.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) to `true` (default: `false`). Once the headers are present, after an initial request, browsers will force HTTPS on all subsequent connections to the host. This reduces the possibility of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, which HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects are vulnerable to. [#77244][#77244]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Added a `created` time column to the `crdb_internal.active_range_feeds` virtual table to improve observability and debuggability of the rangefeed system. [#77597][#77597]
- [Incremental backups](../v22.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#incremental-backups) created by [`BACKUP ... INTO`](../v22.1/backup.html) or [`BACKUP ... TO`](../v22.1/backup.html) are now stored by default under the path `/incrementals` within the backup destination, rather than under each backup's path. This enables easier management of cloud-storage provider policies specifically applied to incremental backups. [#75970][#75970]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a `sql.auth.resolve_membership_single_scan.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html), which changes the query for an internal role membership cache. Previously the code would recursively look up each role in the membership hierarchy, leading to multiple queries. With the setting on, it uses a single query. The setting is `true` by default. [#77359][#77359]
- The [data type](../v22.1/data-types.html) of shard columns created for [hash-sharded indexes](../v22.1/hash-sharded-indexes.html) has changed from `INT4` to `INT8`. This should have no effect on behavior or performance. [#76930][#76930]
- Introduced the `sql.contention.resolver.queue_size` metric. This gauge metric gives the current length of the queue of contention events, each awaiting translation of its transaction ID into a transaction fingerprint ID. This metric can be used to assess the level of backlog unresolved contention events. [#77514][#77514]
- Introduced the `sql.contention.resolver.retries` metric. This counter metric reflects the number of retries performed by the contention event store attempting to translate the transaction ID of the contention event into a transaction fingerprint ID. Any spike in this metric could indicate a possible anomaly in the transaction ID resolution protocol. [#77514][#77514]
- Introduced the `sql.contention.resolver.failed_resolution` metric. This counter metric gives the total number of failed attempts to translate the transaction ID in the contention events into a transaction fingerprint ID. A spike in this metric indicates likely severe failure in the transaction ID resolution protocol. [#77514][#77514]
- Added support for `date_trunc(string, interval)` for compatibility with PostgreSQL. This built-in function is required to support [Django 4.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/4.1/). [#77508][#77508]
- Introduced a `sql.contention.event_store.duration_threshold` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html). This cluster setting specifies the minimum contention duration to cause the contention events to be collected into the `crdb_internal.transaction_contention_events` virtual table (default: `0`). [#77623][#77623]
- Added support for super region functionality. Super regions allow the user to define a set of regions on the database such that any `REGIONAL BY TABLE` based in the super region or any `REGIONAL BY ROW` partition in the super region will have all their replicas in regions within the super region. The primary use is for [data domiciling](../v22.1/data-domiciling.html). Super regions are an experimental feature and are gated behind the session variable: `enable_super_regions`. The [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) `sql.defaults.super_regions.enabled` is used to enable super regions (default: `false`). [#76620][#76620]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added the `server.shutdown.connection_wait` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) to the [draining process](../v22.1/node-shutdown.html#node-shutdown-sequence) configuration. This adds a draining phase where the server waits for SQL connections to be closed, and once all SQL connections are closed before timeout, the server proceeds to the next draining phase. This provides a workaround when customers encounter intermittent blips and failed requests when performing operations that are related to restarting nodes. [#72991][#72991]
- The [cluster settings](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) `admission.kv.tenant_weights.enabled` and `admission.kv.stores.tenant_weights.enabled` can now be used to enable tenant weights in multi-tenant storage servers (Defaults: `false`). Tenant weights are based on the number of ranges for each tenant, and allow for weighted fair sharing. [#77575][#77575]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The `cockroach debug tsdump` command now allows viewing time-series data even in case of node failures by being re-run with the import filename set to `-`. [#77247][#77247]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added an alert banner on the [**Cluster Overview** page](../v22.1/ui-cluster-overview-page.html) that indicates when more than one node version is detected on the cluster. The alert lists the node versions detected and how many nodes are on each version. This provides more visibility into the progress of a cluster upgrade. [#76932][#76932]
- The **Compactions/Flushes** graph on the [Storage dashboard](../v22.1/ui-storage-dashboard.html) now shows bytes written by these operations, and has been split into separate per-node graphs. [#77558][#77558]
- The [**Explain Plan**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#explain-plans) tab of the [**Statement Details** page](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) now shows statistics for all the plans executed by the selected statement on the selected period. [#77632][#77632]
- Active operations can now be inspected in a new **Active operations** page linked from the [**Advanced Debug** page](../v22.1/ui-debug-pages.html). This facilitates viewing active traces and taking snapshots. [#77712][#77712]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where clicking the "Reset SQL stats" button on the [**Statements**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html) and [**Transactions**](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html) pages caused, in DB Console, an infinite loading spinner and, in {{ site.data.products.db }} Console, the **Statements**/**Transactions** table to be reloaded without limiting to the time range that the user had selected. The button now correctly reloads the table according to the selected time in both DB Console and {{ site.data.products.db }} Console. [#77571][#77571]
- Previously, the `information_schema` tables `administrable_role_authorizations` and `applicable_roles` were incorrectly always returning the current user for the grantee column. Now, the column will contain the correct role that was granted the parent role given in the `role_name` column. [#77359][#77359]
- Fixed a bug that caused errors when attempting to create table statistics (with [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v22.1/create-statistics.html) or [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v22.1/explain-analyze.html)) for a table containing an index which indexed only [virtual computed columns](../v22.1/computed-columns.html). This bug had been present since version v21.1.0. [#77507][#77507]
- All automatic jobs are now hidden from the [Jobs page](../v22.1/ui-jobs-page.html) of the DB Console. [#77331][#77331]
- Added a limit of 7 concurrent asynchronous consistency checks per store, with an upper timeout of 1 hour. This prevents abandoned consistency checks from building up in some circumstances, which could lead to increasing disk usage as they held onto Pebble snapshots. [#77433][#77433]
- Fixed a bug causing incorrect counts of `under_replicated_ranges` and `over_replicated_ranges` in the `crdb_internal.replication_stats` table for multi-region databases. [#76430][#76430]
- Previously, intermittent validation failures could be observed on schema objects, where a job ID was detected as missing when validating objects in a transaction. This has been fixed. [#76532][#76532]
- Previously, adding a [hash-sharded index](../v22.1/hash-sharded-indexes.html) to a table watched by a changefeed could produce errors due to not distinguishing between backfills of visible columns and backfills of merely public ones, which may be hidden or inaccessible. This is now fixed. [#77316][#77316]
- Fixed a bug that caused internal errors when `COALESCE` and `IF` expressions had inner expressions with different types that could not be cast to a common type. [#77608][#77608]
- A zone config change event now includes the correct details of what was changed instead of incorrectly displaying `undefined`. [#77773][#77773]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-4-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved the [optimizer](../v22.1/cost-based-optimizer.html)'s cardinality estimates for predicates involving many constrained columns. This may result in better index selection for these queries. [#76786][#76786]
- Improved jobs system resilience to scheduled jobs that may lock up jobs/scheduled job table for long periods of time. Each schedule now has a limited amount of time to complete its execution. The timeout is controlled via the `jobs.scheduler.schedule_execution.timeout` setting. [#77372][#77372]
