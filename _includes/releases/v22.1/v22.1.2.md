## v22.1.2

Release Date: June 22, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-2-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- CSV is now a supported format for changefeeds. This only works with `initial_scan='only'` and does not work with diff/resolved options. [#82355][#82355]

<h3 id="v22-1-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The `bulkio.ingest.sender_concurrency_limit` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) can be used to adjust the concurrency at which any one SQL node, across all operations that it is running (e.g., [`RESTORE`s](../v22.1/restore.html), [`IMPORT`s](../v22.1/import.html), and [schema changes](../v22.1/online-schema-changes.html)), will send bulk ingest requests to the KV storage layer. [#81789][#81789]
- The `sql.ttl.range_batch_size` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) is deprecated. [#82711][#82711]
- The pgwire `DESCRIBE` command is now supported for use against a cursor created with the `DECLARE` command. This improves compatibility with PostgreSQL and is needed for compatibility with psycopg3 server-side cursors. [#82772][#82772]
- Fixed an issue where `SHOW BACKUP with privileges` displayed grant statements with incorrect syntax (specifically, without the object type). As an example, previously displayed: `GRANT ALL ON status TO j4;`  Now displayed: `GRANT ALL ON TYPE status TO j4;` [#82727][#82727]
- Added the `spanconfig.kvsubscriber.update_behind_nanos` metric to track the latency between realtime and the last update handled by the `KVSubscriber`. This metric can be used to monitor the staleness of a node's view of reconciled `spanconfig` state. [#82895][#82895]

<h3 id="v22-1-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The time picker component has been improved such that users can use keyboard input to select a time without having to type `" (UTC)"`. [#82495][#82495]
- The time picker now opens directly to the custom time selection menu when a custom time is already selected. A "Preset Time Ranges" navigation link has been added to go to the preset options from the custom menu. [#82495][#82495]

<h3 id="v22-1-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The output of [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](../v22.1/show-create.html#show-the-create-view-statement-for-a-view) now properly includes the keyword `MATERIALIZED` for materialized views. [#82196][#82196]
- Fixed the `identity_generation` column in the [`information_schema.columns`](../v22.1/information-schema.html#columns) table so its value is either `BY DEFAULT`, `ALWAYS`, or `NULL`. [#82184][#82184]
- Disk write probes during node liveness heartbeats will no longer get stuck on stalled disks, instead returning an error once the operation times out. Additionally, disk probes now run in parallel on nodes with multiple stores. [#81476][#81476]
- Fixed a bug where an unresponsive node (e.g., a node with a stalled disk) could prevent other nodes from acquiring its leases, effectively stalling these ranges until the node was shut down or recovered. [#81815][#81815]
- Fixed a crash that could happen when preparing a statement with unknown placeholder types. [#82647][#82647]
- Previously, when adding a column to a pre-existing table and adding a partial index referencing that column in the transaction, DML operations against the table while the schema change was ongoing would fail. Now these hazardous schema changes are not allowed. [#82668][#82668]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would sometimes automatically retry the `BEGIN` statement of an explicit transaction. [#82681][#82681]
- Fixed a bug where draining/drained nodes could re-acquire leases during an import or an index backfill. [#80834][#80834]
- Fixed a bug where the startup of an internal component after a server restart could result in the delayed application of zone configuration. [#82858][#82858]
- Previously, using [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v22.1/as-of-system-time.html) of two different statements in the same line would result in an assertion error. This is now a PG error with code `0A000`. [#82654][#82654]
- Fixed a bug where KV requests, in particular export requests issued during a [backup](../v22.1/backup.html), were rejected incorrectly causing the backup to fail with a `batch timestamp <ts> must be after replica GC threshold` error. The requests were rejected on the pretext that their timestamp was below the [garbage collection threshold](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#garbage-collection) of the key span. This was because the [protected timestamps](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#protected-timestamps) were not considered when computing the garbage collection threshold for the key span being backed up. Protected timestamp records hold up the garbage collection threshold of a span during long-running operations such as backups to prevent revisions from being garbage collected. [#82757][#82757]
