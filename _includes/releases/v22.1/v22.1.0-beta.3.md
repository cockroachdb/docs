<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Unified the syntax for defining the behavior of initial scans on [changefeeds](../v22.1/change-data-capture-overview.html) by extending the [`initial_scan`](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html#initial-scan) option to accept three possible values: `yes`, `no`, or `only`. [#79471][#79471]
- Changefeeds can now target tables with [more than one column family](../v22.1/changefeeds-on-tables-with-column-families.html) using either the [`split_column_families` option](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html#split-column-families) or the `FAMILY` keyword. Changefeeds will emit individual messages per column family on a table. [#79448][#79448]
- The `full_table_name` option is now supported for all [changefeed](../v22.1/change-data-capture-overview.html) sinks. [#79448][#79448]
- `LATEST` files are no longer overwritten and are now versioned and written in the `/metadata/latest` directory for non-mixed-version clusters. [#79553][#79553]
- Previously, the [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`](../v22.1/alter-changefeed.html) statement would not work with changefeeds that use fully qualified names in their [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html) statement. This is now fixed by ensuring that each existing target is added with its fully qualified name so that it can be resolved in validation checks. Every changefeed will now display the fully qualified name of every target in the [`SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB`](../v22.1/show-jobs.html) query. [#79745][#79745]
- Added a `changefeed.backfill.scan_request_size` setting to control scan request size during [backfill](../v22.1/changefeed-messages.html#schema-changes-with-column-backfill). [#79710][#79710]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now ensures the user passes the same number of locality-aware URIs for the full [backup](../v22.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) destination as the `incremental_location` parameter (for example, `BACKUP INTO LATEST IN ($1, $2, $3) WITH incremental_location = ($4, $5, $6)`). [#79600][#79600]
- `EXPLAIN (DDL)`, when invoked on statements supported by the declarative schema changer, prints a plan of what the schema changer will do. This can be useful for anticipating the complexity of a schema change (for example, anything involving backfill or validation operations might be slow to run) and for troubleshooting. `EXPLAIN (DDL, VERBOSE)` produces a more detailed plan. [#79780][#79780]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new time-series metric, `storage.marked-for-compaction-files`, for the count of files marked for compaction. This is useful for monitoring storage-level background migrations. [#79370][#79370]
- [Changefeed](../v22.1/change-data-capture-overview.html) creation and failure event logs are now emitted to the [`TELEMETRY`](../v22.1/eventlog.html#telemetry-events) logging channel. [#79749][#79749]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Introduced a new `ttllogger` [workload](../v22.1/cockroach-workload.html) which creates a TTL table emulating a "log" with rows expiring after the duration specified in the `--ttl` flag. [#79482][#79482]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [Hot Ranges page](../v22.1/ui-hot-ranges-page.html) now allows filtering by column. [#79647][#79647]
- Added status of automatic statistics collection to the [Databases](../v22.1/ui-databases-page.html) and Databases [table details](../v22.1/ui-databases-page.html#table-details) pages. [#76168][#76168]
- Added timestamp of last statistics collection to the Databases > [Tables](../v22.1/ui-databases-page.html#tables-view) and Databases table details pages. [#76168][#76168]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, privileges for restored tables were being generated incorrectly without taking into consideration their parent schema's default privilege descriptor. This is now fixed. [#79534][#79534]
- Fixed a bug that caused an internal error when the inner expression of a column access expression evaluated to `NULL`. For example, evaluation of the expression `(CASE WHEN b THEN ((ROW(1) AS a)) ELSE NULL END).a` would error when `b` is `false`. This bug was present since v19.1 or earlier. [#79529][#79529]
- Fixed a bug that caused an error when accessing a named column of a labeled tuple. The bug only occurred when an expression could produce one of several different tuples. For example, `(CASE WHEN true THEN (ROW(1) AS a) ELSE (ROW(2) AS a) END).a` would fail to evaluate. This bug was present since v22.1.0. Although present in previous versions, it was impossible to encounter due to limitations that prevented using tuples in this way. [#79529][#79529]
- Previously, queries reading from an index or primary key on `FLOAT` or `REAL` columns `DESC` would read `-0` for every `+0` value stored in the index. This has been fixed to correctly read `+0` for `+0` and `-0` for `-0`. [#79533][#79533]
- Fixed some cases where a job or schema change that had encountered an error would continue to execute for some time before eventually failing. [#79713][#79713]
- Previously, the optional `is_called` parameter of the `setval` function would default to `false` when not specified. It now defaults to `true` to match PostgreSQL behavior. [#79779][#79779]
- On the [Raft Messages](../v22.1/ui-debug-pages.html) page, the date picker and drag-to-zoom functionality are now fixed. [#79791][#79791]
- Fixed a bug where Pebble compaction heuristics could allow a large compaction backlog to accumulate, eventually leading to high read amplification. [#79597][#79597]
