Release Date: April 18, 2022

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Unified the syntax for defining the behavior of initial scans on [changefeeds](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html) by extending the `initial_scan` option to accept three possible values: `'yes|no|only'`. [#79471][#79471]
- Changefeed messages for tables with multiple [column families](../v22.1/column-families.html) using the `split_column_families` option or the [`CREATE CHANGEFEED for TABLE bar FAMILY f_1`](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html) syntax will append the family name to the table name in the default topic. For example, `CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE foo, TABLE bar FAMILY f_1` will emit to the topics `foo` and `bar.f_1`.  In cloud storage sinks such as s3, the filename will include the family separated by a `+` (e.g., `bar+f_1`). A changefeed created with the `split_column_families` option will create new topics if new families are added to a watched table that already had multiple column families. [#79448][#79448]
- The `full_table_name` option is now supported for all [changefeed](../v22.1/change-data-capture.html) sinks. [#79448][#79448]
- `LATEST` files are no longer overwritten and are now versioned and written in the `/metadata/latest` directory for non-mixed clusters. [#79553][#79553]
- Previously, the [`ALTER CHANGEFEED`](../v22.1/alter-changefeed.html) statement would not work with changefeeds that use fully qualified names in their [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](../v22.1/create-changefeed.html) statement. This is now fixed by ensuring that each existing target is added with its fully qualified name so that it can be resolved in validation checks. Every changefeed will now display the fully qualified name of every target in the [`SHOW CHANGEFEED JOB`](../v22.1/show-jobs.html) query. [#79745][#79745]
- Added a `changefeed.backfill.scan_request_size` setting to control scan request size during backfill. [#79710][#79710]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now ensures the user passes the same number of locality-aware URIs for the full [backup](../v22.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) destination as the `incremental_location` parameter (i.e., `BACKUP INTO LATEST IN ($1, $2, $3) WITH incremental_location = ($4, $5, $6)`). [#79600][#79600]
- `EXPLAIN (DDL)`, when invoked on statements supported by the declarative schema changer, prints a plan of what the schema changer will do. This can be useful for anticipating the complexity of a schema change (e.g., anything involving backfill or validation operations might be slow to run) and for troubleshooting. `EXPLAIN (DDL, VERBOSE)` produces a more detailed plan. [#79780][#79780]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new time-series metric, `storage.marked-for-compaction-files`, for the count of files marked for compaction. This is useful for monitoring storage-level background migrations. [#79370][#79370]
- [Changefeed](../v22.1/change-data-capture.html) creation and failure event logs are now emitted to the [`TELEMETRY` logging channel](../v22.1/eventlog.html#telemetry-events). [#79749][#79749]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Introduced a new `ttllogger` [workload](../v22.1/cockroach-workload.html) which creates a TTL table emulating a "log" with rows expiring after the duration specified in the `--ttl` flag. [#	][#79482]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Filtering by column has been added to the [Hot Ranges page](../v22.1/ui-hot-ranges-page.html). [#79647][#79647]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Previously, privileges for restored tables were being generated incorrectly without taking into consideration their parent schema's default privilege descriptor. This is now fixed. [#79534][#79534]
- Fixed a bug that caused an internal error when the inner expression of a column access expression evaluated to `NULL`. For example, evaluation of the expression `(CASE WHEN b THEN ((ROW(1) AS a)) ELSE NULL END).a` would error when `b` is `false`. This bug was present since v19.1 or earlier. [#79529][#79529]
- Fixed a bug that caused an error when accessing a named column of a labeled tuple. The bug only occurred when an expression could produce one of several different tuples. For example, `(CASE WHEN true THEN (ROW(1) AS a) ELSE (ROW(2) AS a) END).a` would fail to evaluate. This bug was present since v22.1.0. Although present in previous versions, it was impossible to encounter due to limitations that prevented using tuples in this way. [#79529][#79529]
- Previously, queries reading from an index or primary key on `FLOAT` or `REAL` columns `DESC` would read `-0` for every `+0` value stored in the index. This has been fixed to correctly read `+0` for `+0` and `-0` for `-0`. [#79533][#79533]
- Separate tenants now use unique values for the internal field `ClusterID`. Previously, separate tenants that were hosted on the same storage cluster would be assigned the same `ClusterID`. [#79742][#79742]
- Fixed some cases where a job or schema change that had encountered an error would continue to execute for some time before eventually failing. [#79713][#79713]
- Previously, the optional `is_called` parameter of the `setval` function would default to `false` when not specified. It now defaults to `true` to match PostgreSQL behavior. [#79779][#79779]
- Updated props on the [Raft Messages](../v22.1/ui-debug-pages.html) page to include functions to set the time window and time scale in order to fix the date picker and drag-to-zoom functionality. [#79791][#79791]
- Fixed a bug where Pebble compaction heuristics could allow a large compaction backlog to accumulate, eventually triggering high read amplfiication. [#79597][#79597]
