## v22.1.6

Release Date: August 23, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-6-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- [Client certificates](../v22.1/authentication.html#client-authentication) now have tenant scoping, which allows an operator to authenticate a client to a specific tenant. A tenant-scoped client certificate contains the client name in the CN and the tenant ID in the URIs section of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) values. The format of the URI SAN is `crdb://tenant/<tenant_id>/user/<username>` [#84371][#84371].
- The HTTP endpoints under the `/api/v2` prefix will now accept cookie-based authentication similar to other HTTP endpoints used by the [DB Console](../v22.1/ui-overview.html). The encoded session must be in a cookie named `"session"`, and the `"X-Cockroach-API-Session"` header is required to be set to `"cookie"` for the session to be read from the cookie header. A cookie provided without the custom header present will be ignored. [#85553][#85553]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Upgraded `cloud.google.com/go/storage` from v18.2.0 to v1.21.0 to allow for injection of custom retry logic in the [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk). [#85763][#85763]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Removed the `DatabaseID` field from the sampled query telemetry log due to its potential to cause indefinite blocking in the case of a lease acquisition failure. [#85026][#85026]
- The structured payloads used for telemetry logs now include the following new fields: 
  
  - `MaxFullScanRowsEstimate`: The maximum number of rows scanned by a full scan, as estimated by the optimizer. 
  - `TotalScanRowsEstimate`: The total number of rows read by all scans in a query, as estimated by the optimizer. 
  - `OutputRowsEstimate`: The number of rows output by a query, as estimated by the optimizer. 
  - `StatsAvailable`: Whether table statistics were available to the optimizer when planning a query. 
  - `NanosSinceStatsCollected`: The maximum number of nanoseconds that have passed since stats were collected on any table scanned by a query.
  - `BytesRead`: The number of bytes read from disk. 
  - `RowsRead`: The number of rows read from disk. 
  - `RowsWritten`: The number of rows written.
  - `InnerJoinCount`: The number of inner joins in the query plan. 
  - `LeftOuterJoinCount`: The number of left (or right) outer joins in the query plan.
  - `FullOuterJoinCount`: The number of full outer joins in the query plan.
  - `SemiJoinCount`: The number of semi joins in the query plan.
  - `AntiJoinCount`: The number of anti joins in the query plan.
  - `IntersectAllJoinCount`: The number of intersect all joins in the query plan.
  - `ExceptAllJoinCount`: The number of except all joins in the query plan.
  - `HashJoinCount`: The number of hash joins in the query plan.
  - `CrossJoinCount`: The number of cross joins in the query plan.
  - `IndexJoinCount`: The number of index joins in the query plan.
  - `LookupJoinCount`: The number of lookup joins in the query plan.
  - `MergeJoinCount`: The number of merge joins in the query plan.
  - `InvertedJoinCount`: The number of inverted joins in the query plan.
  - `ApplyJoinCount`: The number of apply joins in the query plan.
  - `ZigZagJoinCount`: The number of zig zag joins in the query plan. [#85337][#85337] [#85743][#85743]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Telemetry logs will now display more finely redacted error messages from SQL execution. Previously, the entire error string was fully redacted. [#85403][#85403]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The CLI now contains a flag (`--log-config-vars`) that allows for environment variables to be specified for expansion within the logging configuration file. This allows a single logging configuration file to service an array of sinks without further manipulation of the configuration file. [#85171][#85171]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-api-endpoint-changes">API endpoint changes</h3>

- A new `/api/v2/sql/` endpoint enables execution of simple SQL queries over HTTP. [#84374][#84374]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an issue with incorrect start time position of selected time range on the [Metrics page](../v22.1/ui-overview.html#metrics). [#85835][#85835]
- Fixed an issue where the [`information_schema`](../v22.1/information-schema.html) and [`SHOW GRANTS`](../v22.1/show-grants.html) command did not report that object owners have permission to `GRANT` privileges on that object. [#84918][#84918]
- Fixed an issue where imports and rebalances were being slowed down due to the accumulation of empty directories from range snapshot applications. [#84223][#84223]
- The v22.1 upgrade migration `21.2-56: populate RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndexTerm for all ranges` is now more resilient to failures. This migration must be applied across all ranges and replicas in the system, and can fail with `operation "wait for Migrate application" timed out` if any replicas are temporarily unavailable, which is increasingly likely to happen in large clusters with many ranges. Previously, this would restart the migration from the start. [#84909][#84909]
- Fixed a bug where using `CREATE SCHEDULE` in a mixed version cluster could prevent the scheduled job from actually running because of incorrectly writing a lock file. [#84372][#84372]
- Previously, [restoring from backups](../v22.1/backup-and-restore-overview.html) on mixed-version clusters that had not yet upgraded to v22.1 could fail with `cannot use bulkio.restore_at_current_time.enabled until version MVCCAddSSTable`. Restores now fall back to the v21.2 behavior instead of erroring in this scenario. [#84641][#84641]
- Fixed incorrect error handling that could cause casts to OID types to fail in some cases. [#85124][#85124]
- Fixed a bug where the privileges for an object owner would not be correctly transferred when the owner was changed. [#85083][#85083]
- The `crdb_internal.deserialize_session` built-in function no longer causes an error when handling an empty prepared statement. [#85122][#85122]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v20.2 that could cause a panic when an expression contained a geospatial comparison like `~` that was negated. [#84630][#84630]
- Fixed a bug where new leaseholders with a `VOTER_INCOMING` type would not always be detected properly during query execution, leading to occasional increased tail latencies due to unnecessary internal retries. [#85315][#85315]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.1.0 that could cause the optimizer to not use auto-commit for some mutations in multi-region clusters when it should have done so. [#85434][#85434]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.1.0 that could cause the optimizer to reject valid bounded staleness queries with the error `unimplemented: cannot use bounded staleness for DISTRIBUTE`. [#85434][#85434]
- Previously, concatenating a UUID with a string would not use the normal string representation of the UUID values. This is now fixed so that, for example, `'eb64afe6-ade7-40ce-8352-4bb5eec39075'::UUID || 'foo'` returns `eb64afe6-ade7-40ce-8352-4bb5eec39075foo` rather than the encoded representation. [#85416][#85416]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could run into an error when a query included a limited reverse scan and some rows needed to be retrieved by `GET` requests. [#85584][#85584]
- Fixed a bug where the SQL execution HTTP endpoint did not properly support queries with multiple result values. [#84374][#84374]
- Fixed a bug where clients could sometimes receive errors due to lease acquisition timeouts of the form `operation "storage.pendingLeaseRequest: requesting lease" timed out after 6s`. [#85428][#85428]
- The [**Statement details**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html) page now renders properly for statements where the hex representation of the `fingerprint_id` is less than 16 digits. [#85529][#85529]
- Fixed a bug that could cause union queries to return incorrect results in rare cases. [#85654][#85654]
- Fixed a bug that could cause upgrades to fail if there was a table with a computed column that used a cast from [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v22.1/timestamp.html) to [`STRING`](../v22.1/string.html). [#85779][#85779]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a panic in rare cases when the unnest() [function](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html) was used with a tuple return type. [#85349][#85349]
- Fixed an issue where the `NO_INDEX_JOIN` hint could be ignored by the optimizer in some cases, causing it to create a query plan with an index join. [#85917][#85917]
- Fixed a bug where changefeed jobs undergoing catch-up scans could fail with the error `expected provisional value for intent with ts X, found Y`. [#86117][#86117]
- Previously, an empty column in the input to `COPY ... FROM CSV` would be treated as an empty string. Now, this is treated as `NULL`. The quoted empty string can still be used to input an empty string. Similarly, if a different `NULL` token is specified in the command options, it can be quoted in order to be treated as the equivalent string value. [#85926][#85926]
- Fixed a bug where attempting to select data from a table that had different partitioning columns used for the primary and secondary indexes could cause an error. This occurred if the primary index had zone configurations applied to the index partitions with different regions for different partitions, and the secondary index had a different column type than the primary index for its partitioning column(s). [#86218][#86218]

<h3 id="v22-1-6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Previously, if there was sudden increase in the volume of pending MVCC GC work, there was an impact on foreground latencies. These sudden increases commonly occurred when: 

  - `gc.ttlseconds` was reduced dramatically over tables/indexes that accrue a lot of MVCC garbage,
  - a paused backup job from more than one day ago was canceled or failed, or
  - a backup job that started more than one day ago just finished.

An indicator of a large increase in the volume of pending MVCC GC work is a steep climb in the **GC Queue** graph on the **Metrics** page of the [DB Console](../v22.1/ui-overview.html). With this fix, the effect on foreground latencies as a result of this sudden build is reduced. [#85899][#85899]
