## v22.1.0-alpha.5

Release Date: March 28, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-5-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- [Changefeeds](../v22.1/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html) now record the message size histogram. [#77711][#77711]
- Users can now perform initial scans on [newly added changefeed](../v22.1/alter-changefeed.html) targets by executing the following statement:  `ALTER CHANGEFEED <job_id> ADD <targets> WITH initial_scan`
    The default behavior is to perform no initial scans on newly added targets, but users can explicitly request this by replacing `initial_scan` with `no_initial_scan`. [#77263][#77263]
- The value of the `server.child_metrics.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) is now set to `true`. [#77561][#77561]
- CockroachDB now limits the number of concurrent catchup scan requests issued by [rangefeed](../v22.1/create-and-configure-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) clients. [#77866][#77866]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- TTL metrics are now labelled by relation name if the `server.child_metrics.enabled` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) is enabled and the `ttl_label_metrics` storage parameter is set to `true`. This is to prevent a potentially unbounded cardinality on TTL related metrics. [#77567][#77567]
- Added support for the `MOVE` command, which moves a SQL cursor without fetching any rows from it. `MOVE` is identical to [`FETCH`](../v22.1/limit-offset.html), including in its arguments and syntax, except it doesn't return any rows. [#74877][#74877]
- Added the `enable_implicit_transaction_for_batch_statements` [session variable](../v22.1/set-vars.html). It defaults to false. When true, multiple statements in a single query (a "batch statement") will all run in the same implicit transaction, which matches the PostgreSQL wire protocol. This setting is provided for users who want to preserve the behavior of CockroachDB versions v21.2 and lower. [#77865][#77865]
- The `enable_implicit_transaction_for_batch_statements` session variable now defaults to false. [#77973][#77973]
- The `experimental_enable_hash_sharded_indexes` session variable is deprecated as hash-sharded indexes are enabled by default. Enabling this setting results in a no-op. [#78038][#78038]
- New `crdb_internal.merge_stats_metadata` [built-in function](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) to group statement statistics metadata. [#78064][#78064]
- [Changefeeds](../v22.1/changefeeds-on-tables-with-column-families.html) can now specify column families to target, using the syntax `[TABLE] foo FAMILY bar`. For example, `CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE foo FAMILY bar, TABLE foo FAMILY baz, TABLE users` will create a feed that watches the `bar` and `baz` column families of `foo`, as well as the whole table `users`. A family must exist with that name when the feed is created. If all columns in a watched family are dropped in an `ALTER TABLE` statement, the feed will fail with an error, similar to dropping a table. The behavior is otherwise similar to feeds created using `split_column_families`. [#77964][#77964]
- [Casts](../v22.1/data-types.html#data-type-conversions-and-casts) that are affected by the `DateStyle` or `IntervalStyle` session variables used in [computed columns](../v22.1/computed-columns.html) or [partial index](../v22.1/partial-indexes.html) definitions will be rewritten to use immutable functions after upgrading to v22.1. [#78229][#78229]
- When the user runs [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v22.1/show-backup.html) on an encrypted incremental backup, they must set the `encyrption_info_dir` directory to the full backup directory in order for `SHOW BACKUP` to work. [#78096][#78096]
- The [`BACKUP TO`](../v22.1/backup.html) syntax to take backups is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Create a backup collection using the `BACKUP INTO` syntax. [#78250][#78250]
- Using the [`RESTORE FROM`](../v22.1/restore.html) syntax without an explicit subdirectory pointing to a backup in a collection is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Use `RESTORE FROM <backup> IN <collection>` to restore a particular backup in a collection. [#78250][#78250]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-5-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where starting [`cockroach demo`](../v22.1/cockroach-demo.html) with the `--global` flag would not simulate latencies correctly when combined with the `--insecure` flag. [#78169][#78169]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-5-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Added full scan, distributed, and vectorized information of the plan displayed on [**Statement Details**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) page. [#78114][#78114]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-alpha-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed successive [schema change](../v22.1/online-schema-changes.html) backfills from skipping spans that were checkpointed by an initial backfill that was restarted. [#77797][#77797]
- Fixed a bug where statements that arrived in a batch during the simple query protocol would all execute in their own implicit [transactions](../v22.1/transactions.html). Now, we match the PostgreSQL wire protocol behavior, so all these statements share the same implicit transaction. If a `BEGIN` is included in a statement batch, then the existing implicit transaction is upgraded to an explicit transaction. [#77865][#77865]
- Fixed a bug in the [optimizer](../v22.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) that prevented expressions of the form `(NULL::STRING[] <@ ARRAY['x'])` from being folded to `NULL`. This bug was introduced in v21.2.0. [#78042][#78042]
- Fixed broken links to the **Statement Details** page from the [**Advanced Debug**](../v22.1/ui-debug-pages.html) and [**Sessions**](../v22.1/ui-sessions-page.html) pages. [#78099][#78099]
- Fixed a memory leak in the [Pebble](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#pebble) block cache. [#78260][#78260]
