## v22.1.3

Release Date: July 11, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-3-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Added the ability to provide short-lived OAuth 2.0 tokens as a form of short-lived credentials to Google Cloud Storage and KMS. The token can be passed to the GCS or KMS URI via the new `BEARER_TOKEN` parameter for "specified" authentication mode. 

    Example GCS URI: `gs://<bucket>/<key>?AUTH=specified&BEARER_TOKEN=<token>`
    
    Example KMS URI: `gs:///<key_resource>?AUTH=specified&BEARER_TOKEN=<token>` 
    
    There is no refresh mechanism associated with this token, so it is up to the user to ensure that its TTL is longer than the duration of the job or query that is using the token. The job or query may irrecoverably fail if one of its tokens expire before completion. [#83210][#83210]

<h3 id="v22-1-3-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now sends the `Severity_Nonlocalized` field in the `pgwire` Notice Response. [#82939][#82939]
- Updated the `pg_backend_pid()` [built-in function](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) to match the data in the query cancellation key created during session initialization. This function is just for compatibility, and it does not return a real process ID. [#83167][#83167]
- The log fields for captured index usage statistics are no longer redacted [#83293][#83293]
- CockroachDB now returns a message instructing users to run hash-sharded index creation statements from a pre-v22.1 node, or just wait until the upgrade is finalized, when the cluster is in a mixed state during a rolling upgrade. Previously, we simply threw a descriptor validation error. [#83556][#83556]
- The [sampled query telemetry log](../v22.1/logging-overview.html#logging-destinations) now includes a plan gist field. The plan gist field provides a compact representation of a logical plan for the sampled query. The field is written as a base64-encoded string. [#83643][#83643]
- The error code reported when trying to use a system or [virtual column](../v22.1/computed-columns.html) in the `STORING` clause of an `INDEX` has been changed from `XXUUU (internal error)` to `0A000 (feature not supported)`. [#83648][#83648]
- [Foreign keys](../v22.1/foreign-key.html) can now reference the `crdb_region` column in [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v22.1/multiregion-overview.html#regional-tables) even if `crdb_region` is not explicitly part of a `UNIQUE` constraint. This is possible since `crdb_region` is implicitly included in every index on `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables as the partitioning key. This applies to whichever column is used as the partitioning column, in case a different name is used with a `REGIONAL BY ROW AS...` statement. [#83815][#83815]

<h3 id="v22-1-3-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Disk stalls no longer prevent the CockroachDB process from crashing when `Fatal` errors are emitted. [#83127][#83127]
- Added a new [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) `bulkio.backup.checkpoint_interval` which controls the minimum interval between writes of progress checkpoints to external storage. [#83266][#83266]
- The application name associated with a SQL session is no longer considered redactable information. [#83553][#83553]

<h3 id="v22-1-3-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The `cockroach demo` command now enables [rangefeeds](../v22.1/use-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) by default. You can restore the previous behavior by starting the command with the `--auto-enable-rangefeeds=false` flag. [#83344][#83344]

<h3 id="v22-1-3-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The DB Console has a more helpful error message when the [**Jobs** page](../v22.1/ui-jobs-page.html) times out, and an information message appears after 2 seconds of loading and indicates that the loading might take a while. Previously, it would show the message `Promise timed out after 30000 ms`. [#82722][#82722]
- The time selection component previously on the [**Statements**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html) and [**Transactions**](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html) pages has been added to the [**Statement Details Overview**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) and [**Explain Plan**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#explain-plans) tabs, and the [**Transaction Details**](../v22.1/ui-transactions-page.html#transaction-details-page) page. [#82721][#82721]
- The **Statement Details** page now shows charts for: Execution and Planning Time, Rows Processed, Execution Retries, Execution Count, and Contention. [#82960][#82960]
- Added a confirmation modal to the `reset SQL Stats` button. [#83142][#83142]
- Application names and database names are now sorted in the dropdown menus. [#83334][#83334]
- A new single column called **Rows Processed**, displayed by default, combines the columns rows read and rows written on the **Statements** and **Transactions** pages. [#83511][#83511]
- The period selected on the [**Metrics**](../v22.1/ui-overview.html#metrics) page and the [**SQL Activity**](../v22.1/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) pages are now aligned. If the user changes the period on one page, the value will be the same for the other. [#83507][#83507]
- Added a period label to the **Statement**, **Statement Details**, and **Transaction** pages, with information about the period in which we're showing information. The **Execution Statistics** tab was removed from the **Statement Details** page. [#83333][#83333]
- Removed the 10 and 30 minute options on the **SQL Activity** page. [#83542][#83542]
- On the **Statements** page, users can no longer filter statements by searching for text in the `EXPLAIN` plan. [#83652][#83652]
- Updated the tooltips on the **Statements** and **Transactions** pages in the DB Console for improved user experience. [#83540][#83540]

<h3 id="v22-1-3-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where, in earlier v22.1 releases, added validation could cause problems for descriptors which carried invalid back references due to a previous bug in v21.1. This stricter validation could result in a variety of query failures. CockroachDB now weakens the validation to permit the corruption. A subsequent fix in v22.2 is scheduled that will repair the invalid reference. [#82859][#82859]
- Added missing support for preparing a `DECLARE` cursor statement with placeholders. [#83001][#83001]
- CockroachDB now treats node unavailable errors as retry-able [changefeed](../v22.1/use-changefeeds.html) errors. [#82874][#82874]
- CockroachDB now ensures running changefeeds do not inhibit node shutdown. [#82874][#82874]
- **Last Execution** time now shows the correct value on **Statement Details** page. [#83114][#83114]
- CockroachDB now uses the proper multiplying factor to contention value on **Statement Details** page. [#82960][#82960]
- CockroachDB now prevents disabling [TTL](../v22.1/row-level-ttl.html) with `ttl = 'off'` to avoid conflicting with other TTL settings. To disable TTL, use `RESET (ttl)`. [#83216][#83216]
- Fixed a panic that could occur if the `inject_retry_errors_enabled` cluster setting is true and an `INSERT` is executed outside of an explicit transaction. [#83193][#83193]
- Previously, a user could be connected to a database but unable to see the metadata for that database in [`pg_catalog`](../v22.1/pg-catalog) if the user did not have privileges for the database. Now, users can always see the `pg_catalog` metadata for a database they are connected to (see [#59875](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/59875)). [#83360][#83360]
- The **Statement Details** page now finds the stats when the `unset` application filter is selected. [#83334][#83334]
- Fixed a bug where no validation was performed when adding a [virtual computed column](../v22.1/computed-columns.html) which was marked `NOT NULL`. This meant that it was possible to have a virtual computed column with an active `NOT NULL` constraint despite having rows in the table for which the column was `NULL`. [#83353][#83353]
- Fixed the behavior of the [`soundex` function](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#string-and-byte-functions) when passed certain Unicode inputs. Previously, certain Unicode inputs could result in crashes, errors, or incorrect output. [#83435][#83435]
- Fixed a bug where a lock could be held for a long period of time when adding a new column to a table (or altering a column type). This contention could make the [**Jobs** page](../v22.1/ui-jobs-page.html) non-responsive and job adoption slow. [#83306][#83306]
- Fixed a bug where a panic could occur during server startup when restarting a node which is running a garbage collection job. [#83474][#83474]
- The period selected on the **Metrics** page time picker is preserved when refreshing the page, and no longer changes to a custom period. [#83507][#83507]
- Changefeeds no longer error out when attempting to checkpoint during intermediate pause-requested or cancel-requested states. [#83569][#83569]
- CockroachDB now retries S3 operations when they error out with a read connection reset error instead of failing the top-level job. [#83581][#83581]
- The **Statements** table for a transaction in the **Transaction Details** page now shows the correct number of statements for a transaction. [#83651][#83651]
- Fixed a bug that prevented [partial indexes](../v22.1/partial-indexes.html) from being used in some query plans. For example, a partial index with a predicate `WHERE a IS NOT NULL` was not previously used if `a` was a `NOT NULL` column. [#83241][#83241]
- Index joins now consider functional dependencies from their input when determining equivalent columns instead of returning an internal error. [#83549][#83549]
- An error message that referred to a non-existent cluster setting now refers to the correct cluster setting: `bulkio.backup.deprecated_full_backup_with_subdir.enabled`. [#81976][#81976]
- Previously, the `CREATE` statement for the [`crdb_internal.cluster_contended_keys` view](../v22.1/crdb-internal.html) was missing the `crdb_internal.table_indexes.descriptor_id = crdb_internal.cluster_contention_events.table_id` `JOIN` condition, resulting in the view having more rows than expected. Now, the view properly joins the `crdb_internal.cluster_contention_events` and `crdb_internal.table_indexes` tables with all necessary `JOIN` conditions. [#83523][#83523]
- Fixed a bug where `ADD COLUMN` or `DROP COLUMN` statements with the legacy schema changer could fail on tables with large rows due to exceeding the Raft command maximum size. [#83816][#83816]

<h3 id="v22-1-3-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- This release significantly improves the performance of [`IMPORT` statements](../v22.1/import.html) when the source is producing data not sorted by the destination table's primary key, especially if the destination table has a very large primary key with lots of columns. [#82746][#82746]
- [Decommissioning nodes](../v22.1/node-shutdown.html) is now substantially faster, particularly for small to moderately loaded nodes. [#82680][#82680]
- Queries with filters containing tuples in `= ANY` expressions, such as `(a, b) = ANY(ARRAY[(1, 10), (2, 20)])`, are now index accelerated. [#83467][#83467]
- Fixed a bug where it was possible to accrue [MVCC](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#mvcc) garbage for much longer than needed. [#82967][#82967]
