## v22.1.4

Release Date: July 19, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-4-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Added access control checks to three [multi-region related built-in functions](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#multi-region-functions). [#83986][#83986]

<h3 id="v22-1-4-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- `crdb_internal.validate_ttl_scheduled_jobs` and `crdb_internal.repair_ttl_table_scheduled_job` can now only be run by users with the [`admin` role](../v22.1/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). [#83972][#83972]
- `txn_fingerprint_id` has been added to `crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics`. The type of the column is `NULL` or `STRING`. [#84020][#84020]
- The [sampled query telemetry log](../v22.1/logging-overview.html#logging-destinations) now includes session, transaction, and statement IDs, as well as the database name of the query. [#84026][#84026]
- `crdb_internal.compact_engine_spans` can now only be run by users with the [`admin` role](../v22.1/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role). [#84095][#84095]

<h3 id="v22-1-4-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Updated `User` column name to `User Name` and fixed `High-water Timestamp` column tooltip on the **Jobs** page. [#83914][#83914]
- Added the ability to search for exact terms in order when wrapping a search in quotes. [#84113][#84113]

<h3 id="v22-1-4-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- A flush message sent during portal execution in the `pgwire` extended protocol no longer results in an error. [#83955][#83955]
- Previously, [virtual computed columns](../v22.1/computed-columns.html) which were marked as `NOT NULL` could be added to new [secondary indexes](../v22.1/indexes.html). Now, attempts to add such columns to a secondary index will result in an error. Note that such invalid columns can still be added to tables. Work to resolve that bug is tracked in #[81675](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/81675). [#83551][#83551]
- Statement and transaction statistics are now properly recorded for implicit transactions with multiple statements. [#84020][#84020]
- The `SessionTransactionReceived` session phase time is no longer recorded incorrectly (which caused large transaction times to appear in the Console) and has been renamed to `SessionTransactionStarted`. [#84030][#84030]
- Fixed a rare issue where the failure to apply a [Pebble](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#pebble) manifest change (typically due to block device failure or unavailability) could result in an incorrect [LSM](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#log-structured-merge-trees) state. Such a state would likely result in a panic soon after the failed application. This change alters the behavior of Pebble to panic immediately in the case of a failure to apply a change to the manifest. [#83735][#83735]
- Fixed a bug which could crash nodes when visiting the [DB Console Statements](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html) page. This bug was present since version v21.2.0. [#83714][#83714]
- Moved connection OK log and metric to same location after auth completes for consistency. This resolves an inconsistency (see linked issue) in the DB Console where the log and metric did not match. [#84103][#84103]
- CockroachDB previously would not normalize `timestamp/timestamptz - timestamp/timestamptz` like PostgreSQL does in some cases (depending on the query). This is now fixed. [#83999][#83999]
- Custom time period selection is now aligned between the [Metrics](../v22.1/ui-overview-dashboard.html) and [SQL Activity](../v22.1/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) pages in the DB Console. [#84184][#84184]
- Fixed a critical bug (#[83687](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/83687)) introduced in v22.1.0 where a failure to transfer a [lease](../v22.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) in the joint config may result in range unavailability. The fix allows the original [leaseholder](../v22.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) to reacquire the lease so that lease transfer can be retried. [#84145][#84145]
- Fixed a minor bug that caused internal errors and poor index recommendations when running [`EXPLAIN`](../v22.1/explain.html) statements. [#84220][#84220]
- Fixed a bug where [`ALTER TABLE ... SET LOCALITY REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v22.1/set-locality.html#set-the-table-locality-to-regional-by-row) could leave the region `ENUM` type descriptor unaware of a dependency on the altered table. This would, in turn, wrongly permit a `DROP REGION` to succeed, rendering the table unusable. Note that this fix does not help existing clusters which have already run such an `ALTER TABLE`; see #[84322](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/84322) for more information on this case. [#84339][#84339]
- Fixed a bug that could cause internal errors in rare cases when running queries with [`GROUP BY`](../v22.1/select-clause.html#create-aggregate-groups) clauses. [#84307][#84307]
- Fixed a bug in transaction conflict resolution which could allow backups to wait on long-running transactions. [#83900][#83900]
- Fixed an internal error `node ... with MaxCost added to the memo` that could occur during planning when calculating the cardinality of an outer join when one of the inputs had 0 rows. [#84377][#84377]

<h3 id="v22-1-4-known-limitations">Known limitations</h3>

- A performance regression exists for v22.1.4 and v22.1.5 that causes [DB Console Metrics pages](../v21.2/ui-overview-dashboard.html) to fail to load, or to load slower than expected, when attempting to display metrics graphs. This regression is fixed in CockroachDB v22.1.6. [#85636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/85636)
