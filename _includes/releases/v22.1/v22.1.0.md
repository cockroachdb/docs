<h4 id="v22-1-0-sql">SQL</h4>

| Version | Feature | Description |
----------+---------+--------------
| Core | Hash-sharded indexes | [Hash-sharded indexes](../v22.1/hash-sharded-indexes.html) distribute sequential data across multiple nodes within your cluster, eliminating hotspots in certain types of scenarios. This feature is now generally available (GA) after a previous experimental release. |
| Core | Super regions | [Super regions](../v22.1/add-super-region.html) allow the user to define a set of regions on the database such that any REGIONAL BY TABLE table based in the super region or any `REGIONAL BY ROW` partition in the super region will have all their replicas in regions that are also within the super region. Their primary use is for [data domiciling](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/data-domiciling.html). This feature is in preview release. |
| Core | Support for AWS DMS | Support for [AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/dev/third-party-database-tools.html#schema-migration-tools) allows users to migrate data from an existing database to CockroachDB. |
| Core | Admission Control | The [Admission Control](../v22.1/admission-control.html) system helps maintain cluster performance and availability when some nodes experience high load. This was previously available as a preview release but is now generally available and enabled by default. |
| Core | Set a quality of service (QoS) level for SQL sessions with Admission Control | In an overload scenario where CockroachDB cannot service all requests, you can identify which requests should be prioritized by setting a _quality of service_ (QoS). [Admission Control](../v22.1/admission-control.html) queues work throughout the system. You can [set the QoS level](../v22.1/admission-control.html#set-quality-of-service-level-for-a-session) on its queues for SQL requests submitted in a session to `background`, `regular`, or `critical`. |
| Core | Rename objects within the transaction that creates them | It is now possible to swap names for tables and other objects within the same transaction that creates them. For example: `CREATE TABLE foo(); BEGIN; ALTER TABLE foo RENAME TO bar; CREATE TABLE foo(); COMMIT;` |
| Core | Drop ENUM values using `ALTER TYPE...DROP VALUE` | Drop a specific value from the user-defined type's list of values. The [`ALTER TYPE...DROP VALUE` statement](../v22.1/alter-type.html) is now available by default to all instances. It was previously disabled by default, requiring the cluster setting enable_drop_enum_value to enable it. |
| Core | Support the UNION variant for recursive CTE | For compatibility with PostgreSQL, `WITH RECURSIVE...UNION` statements are now supported in [recursive common table expressions](../v22.1/common-table-expressions.html#recursive-common-table-expressions). |
| Core | Locality optimized search supports LIMIT clauses | Queries with a LIMIT clause on a single table, either explicitly written or implicit such as in an uncorrelated EXISTS subquery, now [scan that table with improved latency](../v22.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#locality-optimized-search-in-multi-region-clusters) if the table is defined with LOCALITY REGIONAL BY ROW and the number of qualified rows residing in the local region does not exceed the hard limit (the sum of the LIMIT clause and optional OFFSET clause values). This optimization is only applied if the hard limit is 100,000 or less. |
| Core | Surface errors for testing retry logic | To help enable developers test their application's retry logic, they can set the session variable `inject_retry_errors_enabled` so that any statement that is a not a `SET` statement will [return a transaction retry error](../v22.1/transactions.html#testing-transaction-retry-logic) if it is run inside of an explicit transaction. |
| Core | Row Level TTL (preview release) | With Time to Live ("TTL") expiration on table rows, also known as [Row-Level TTL](../v22.1/row-level-ttl.html), CockroachDB automatically deletes rows once they have been stored longer than their specified expiration time. This avoids the complexities and potential performance impacts of managing expiration at the application level. See the documentation for Limitations that are part of this preview release. |
| Core | DATE and INTERVAL style settings available by default | The session variables `datestyle_enabled` and `intervalstyle_enabled`, and the cluster settings `sql.defaults.datestyle.enabled` and `sql.defaults.intervalstyle.enabled` no longer have any effect. When the upgrade to v22.1 is finalized, all of these settings are effectively interpreted as "true", enabling the use of the `intervalstyle` and `datestyle` session and cluster settings. |
| Core | Optimized node draining with `connection_wait` | If you cannot tolerate connection errors during node drain, you can now change the `server.shutdown.connection_wait` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) to allow SQL client connections to gracefully close before CockroachDB forcibly closes them. For guidance, see [Node Shutdown](../v22.1/node-shutdown.html#server-shutdown-connection_wait). |
| Core | PostgreSQL wire protocol query cancellation | In addition to the `CANCEL QUERY SQL` statement, developers can now use the [cancellation method specified by the PostgreSQL wire protocol](../v22.1/cancel-query.html#considerations). |
| Core | Gateway node connection limits | To control the maximum number of non-superuser ([`root`](../v22.1/security-reference/authorization.html#root-user) user or other [`admin` role](../v22.1/security-reference/authorization.html#admin-role)) connections a [gateway node](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/architecture/sql-layer.html#gateway-node) can have open at one time, use the `server.max_connections_per_gateway` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html). If a new non-superuser connection would exceed this limit, an error message and code are returned. |
| Core | Support for `WITH GRANT OPTION` privilege | See [Security](#v22-1-0-security). |

<h4 id="v22-1-0-developer-experience">Developer Experience</h4>

| Version | Feature | Description |
----------+---------+--------------
| Core | Support for Prisma | CockroachDB now supports the [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-preview-cockroach-db-release). A new [tutorial and example app](../v22.1/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb-prisma.html) are available. |
| Core | Lightweight `cockroach-sql` executable | A new client-only SQL shell for users who do not operate the cluster themselves. |

<h4 id="v22-1-0-recovery-and-i-o">Recovery and I/O</h4>

| Version | Feature | Description |
----------+---------+--------------
| Enterprise | Alter changefeeds | The new SQL statement [ALTER CHANGEFEED](../v22.1/alter-changefeed.html) enables users to modify active changefeeds, preventing the need to start a new changefeed. |
| Enterprise | Track metrics per changefeed | Create [labels for capturing a metric](../v22.1/monitor-and-debug-changefeeds.html#using-changefeed-metrics-labels) across one or more specified changefeeds. This is an experimental feature that you can enable using a cluster setting. |
| Core | Changefeed support for tables with multiple column families | Changefeeds can now target [tables with more than one column family](../v22.1/changefeed-examples.html#create-a-changefeed-on-a-table-with-column-families) using either the `split_column_families` option or the `FAMILY` keyword. Changefeeds will emit individual messages per column family on a table. |
| Enterprise | Stream data to Google Cloud Pub/Sub | Changefeeds can now [stream data to a Pub/Sub sink](../v22.1/changefeed-examples.html#create-a-changefeed-connected-to-a-google-cloud-pub-sub-sink). |
| Core | Export to the Apache Parquet format | Using a SQL EXPORT statement, users can now choose to [export data to the Parquet format](../v22.1/export.html). |
| Core | Backup encryption enhancements | See [Security](#v22-1-0-security). |
| Core | Select an S3 storage class for backups | [Associate your backup objects with a specific storage class](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/backup.html#backup-with-an-s3-storage-class) in your Amazon S3 bucket. |
| Core | Exclude a table's data from backups | [Exclude a table's row data from a backup](../v22.1/create-table.html#create-a-table-with-data-excluded-from-backup). This may be useful for tables with high-churn data that you would like to garbage collect more quickly than the incremental backup schedule. |
| Core | Store incremental backups in custom locations | Specify a different [storage location for incremental backups](../v22.1/backup.html#create-incremental-backups) using the new BACKUP option `incremental_location`. This makes it easier to retain full backups longer than incremental backups, as is often required for compliance reasons. |
| Core | Rename database on restore | An optional `new_db_name` clause on [`RESTORE DATABASE`](../v22.1/restore.html#databases) statements allows the user to rename the database they intend to restore. This can be helpful in disaster recovery scenarios when restoring to a temporary state. |

<h4 id="v22-1-0-database-operations">Database operations</h4>

| Version | Feature | Description |
----------+---------+--------------
| Core | DB Console access from a specified node | On the Advanced Debug page, DB Console access can be [routed from the currently accessed node](../v22.1/ui-debug-pages.html#license-and-node-information) to a specific node on the cluster. |
| Core | Alerting rules | Every CockroachDB node exports an [alerting rules template](../v22.1/monitoring-and-alerting.html#prometheus-alerting-rules-endpoint) at `http://<host>:<http-port>/api/v2/rules/`. These rule definitions are formatted for easy integration with Prometheus' Alertmanager. |
| Core | `NOSQLLOGIN` role option | The `NOSQLLOGIN` [role option](../v22.1/create-role.html#role-options) grants a user access to the DB Console without also granting SQL shell access. |
| Core | Hot ranges observability | The [Hot Ranges page](../v22.1/ui-hot-ranges-page.html) of the DB Console provides details about ranges receiving a high number of reads or writes. |
| Core | Per-replica circuit breakers | When individual ranges become temporarily unavailable, requests to those ranges are refused by a [per-replica "circuit breaker" mechanism](../v22.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#per-replica-circuit-breakers) instead of hanging indefinitely. |

<h4 id="v22-1-0-security">Security</h4>

| Version | Feature | Description |
----------+---------+--------------
| Core | Support of Google Cloud KMS for encrypted backups | Google Cloud KMS is now supported as a key management system for [encrypted BACKUP and RESTORE operations](../v22.1/take-and-restore-encrypted-backups.html). |
| Enterprise | Rotate backup encryption keys | Keep your backups secure by rotating the AWS or Google Cloud KMS keys you use to encrypt your backups and adding them to an existing key chain using the new [ALTER BACKUP](../v22.1/alter-backup.html) statement. |
| Core | Support for `WITH GRANT OPTION` privilege | Users granted a privilege with [`WITH GRANT OPTION`](../v22.1/grant.html) can in turn grant that privilege to others. The owner of an object implicitly has the `GRANT OPTION` for all privileges, and the `GRANT OPTION` is inherited through role memberships. This matches functionality offered in PostgreSQL. |
| Core | Support client-provided password hashes for credential definitions | CockroachDB now [recognizes pre-computed password hashes](../v22.1/security-reference/scram-authentication.html#server-user_login-store_client_pre_hashed_passwords-enabled) when presented to the regular `PASSWORD` option when creating or updating a role. |
| Core | Support SCRAM-SHA-256 SASL authentication method | CockroachDB is now able to [authenticate users](../v22.1/security-reference/authentication.html) via the DB Console and SQL sessions when the client provides a cleartext password and the stored credentials are encoded [using the SCRAM-SHA-256 algorithm](../v22.1/security-reference/scram-authentication.html). For SQL client sessions, authentication methods `password` (cleartext passwords) and `cert-password` (TLS client cert or cleartext password) with either CRDB-BCRYPT or SCRAM-SHA-256 stored credentials can now be used. Previously, only CRDB-BCRYPT stored credentials were supported for cleartext password authentication. |
| Core | Support HSTS headers to enforce HTTPS | Clusters can now be configured to send HSTS headers with HTTP requests in order to enable browser-level enforcement of HTTPS for the cluster host. Once the headers are present, after an initial request, browsers will force HTTPS on all subsequent connections to the host. This reduces the possibility of MitM attacks, to which HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects are vulnerable. |

<h4 id="v22-1-0-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h4>

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v22.1](../v22.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- Using [`SESSION_USER`](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#special-syntax-forms) in a projection or `WHERE` clause now returns the `SESSION_USER` instead of the `CURRENT_USER`. For backward compatibility, use [`session_user()`](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#system-info-functions) for `SESSION_USER` and `current_user()` for `CURRENT_USER`. [#70444][#70444]
- Placeholder values (e.g., `$1`) can no longer be used for role names in [`ALTER ROLE`](../v22.1/alter-role.html) statements or for role names in [`CREATE ROLE`](../v22.1/create-role.html)/[`DROP ROLE`](../v22.1/drop-role.html) statements. [#71498][#71498]
- Support has been removed for:
  - `IMPORT TABLE ... CREATE USING`
  - `IMPORT TABLE ... <non-bundle-format> DATA`
  <non-bundle-format> refers to CSV, Delimited, PGCOPY, or AVRO. These are formats that do not define the table schema in the same file as the data. The workaround following this change is to use `CREATE TABLE` with the same schema that was previously being passed into the IMPORT statement, followed by an `IMPORT INTO` the newly created table.
- Non-standard [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expressions that specify seconds or year fields are no longer supported. [#74881][#74881]
- [Changefeeds](../dev/use-changefeeds.html) will now filter out [virtual computed columns](../dev/computed-columns.html) from events by default. [#74916][#74916]
- The [environment variable](../v22.1/cockroach-commands.html#environment-variables) that controls the max amount of CPU that can be taken by password hash computations during authentication was renamed from `COCKROACH_MAX_BCRYPT_CONCURRENCY` to `COCKROACH_MAX_PW_HASH_COMPUTE_CONCURRENCY`. Its semantics remain unchanged. [#74301][#74301]
- The volatility of cast operations between [strings](../v22.1/string.html) and [intervals](../v22.1/interval.html) or [timestamps](../v22.1/timestamp.html) has changed from immutable to stable. This means that these cast operations can no longer be used in computed columns or partial index definitions. Instead, use the following [built-in functions:](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html) `parse_interval`, `parse_date`, `parse_time`, `parse_timetz`, `parse_timestamp`, or `to_char`. Upon upgrade to v22.1, CockroachDB will automatically rewrite any computed columns or partial indexes that use the affected casts to use the new built-in functions. [#78455][#78455]
- Users can no longer define the subdirectory of their full backup. This deprecated syntax can be enabled by changing the new `bulkio.backup.deprecated_full_backup_with_subdir` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) to `true`. [#80145][#80145]

<h4 id="v22-1-0-deprecations">Deprecations</h4>

- The [`cockroach node drain`](../v22.1/cockroach-node.html) command is now able to drain a node by ID, specified on the command line, from another node in the cluster. It now also supports the flag `--self` for symmetry with [`node decommission`](../v22.1/cockroach-node.html#node-decommission). Using `node drain` without either `--self` or a node ID is now deprecated. [#73991][#73991]
- The flag `--self` of the [`cockroach node decommission` command](../v22.1/cockroach-node.html) is deprecated. Instead, operators should specify the node ID of the target node as an explicit argument. The node that the command is connected to should not be a target node. [#74319][#74319]
- The `experimental_enable_hash_sharded_indexes` session variable is deprecated as hash-sharded indexes are enabled by default. Enabling this setting results in a noop. [#78038][#78038]
- The [`BACKUP TO`](../v22.1/) syntax to take backups is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Create a backup collection using the `BACKUP INTO` syntax. [#78250][#78250]
- Users can no longer define the subdirectory of their full backup. This deprecated syntax can be enabled by changing the new `bulkio.backup.deprecated_full_backup_with_subdir` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) to `true`. [#80145][#80145]
- `SHOW BACKUP` without the `IN` keyword to specify a subdirectory is deprecated and will be removed from a future release. Users are recommended to only create collection based backups and view them with `SHOW BACKUP FROM <backup> IN <collection>`. [#79116][#79116]
- Using the [`RESTORE FROM`](../v22.1/restore.html) syntax without an explicit subdirectory pointing to a backup in a collection is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Use `RESTORE FROM <backup> IN <collection>` to restore a particular backup in a collection. [#78250][#78250]
