Release Date: January 9, 2023

<h3 id="v22-1-13-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Removed the feedback survey link from the DB Console. [#93278][#93278]
- Improved the readability of the [metric graph](../v22.1/ui-overview-dashboard.html) tooltip styling by preventing the content from collapsing. [#93929][#93929]
- Fixed a bug where a ts/query could return no data for graphs. This will now return data as the resolution has been adjusted to the sample size. [#93620][#93620]

<h3 id="v22-1-13-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug that could manifest as [restore](../v22.1/restore.html) queries hanging during execution due to slow listing calls in the presence of several backup files. [#93224][#93224]
- Fixed a bug where empty [`COPY`](../v22.1/copy-from.html) commands would not escape after an EOF character, or error if encountering `\.` with no input. [#93260][#93260]
- Fixed a bug where running multiple schema change statements in a single command using a driver that uses the extended pgwire protocol internally ([Npgsql](https://www.npgsql.org/) in .Net as an example) could lead to the error: `"attempted to update job for mutation 2, but job already exists with mutation 1"`. [#92304][#92304]
- Fixed a bug where the non-default [`NULLS` ordering](../v22.1/order-by.html), `NULLS LAST`, was ignored in [window](../v22.1/window-functions.html) and [aggregate](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) functions. This bug could cause incorrect query results when `NULLS LAST` was used. This bug had been introduced in v22.1.0. [#93600][#93600]
- Fixed an issue where `DISTINCT ON` queries would fail with the error `"SELECT DISTINCT ON expressions must match initial ORDER BY expressions"` when the query included an [`ORDER BY`](../v22.1/order-by.html) clause containing `ASC NULLS LAST` or `DESC NULLS FIRST`. [#93608][#93608]
- Previously, CockroachDB would error when receiving [`GEOMETRY` or `GEOGRAPHY`](../v22.1/spatial-glossary.html#data-types) types using binary parameters. This is now resolved. [#93686][#93686]
- Fixed a bug where the `session_id` [session variable](../v22.1/show-vars.html) would not be properly set if used from a subquery. [#93857][#93857]
- Server logs are now correctly fsynced at every syncInterval. [#93994][#93994]
- [`CREATE ROLE`](../v22.1/create-role.html), [`DROP ROLE`](../v22.1/drop-role.html), [`GRANT`](../v22.1/grant.html), and [`REVOKE`](../v22.1/revoke.html) statements no longer work when the transaction is in read-only mode. [#94104][#94104]
- The `stxnamespace`, `stxkind`, and `stxstattarget` columns are now defined in the [`pg_statistics_ext` system catalog](../v22.1/pg-catalog.html). [#94008][#94008]
- Fixed a bug where tables that receive writes concurrent with portions of an [`ALTER TABLE ... SET LOCALITY REGIONAL BY ROW`](../v22.1/set-locality.html) statement could fail with the error: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "new_primary_key"`. This had been introduced in v22.1. [#94252][#94252]
- Previously, CockroachDB could encounter an internal error when evaluating [window functions](../v22.1/window-functions.html) with a `RANGE` window frame mode with an `OFFSET PRECEDING` or `OFFSET FOLLOWING` boundary when an `ORDER BY` clause has a `NULLS LAST` option. This will now result in a regular error since the feature is marked as unsupported. [#94351][#94351]
- Record types can now be encoded with the binary encoding of the PostgreSQL wire protocol. Previously, trying to use this encoding could cause a panic. [#94420][#94420]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect selectivity estimation for queries with ORed predicates all referencing a common single table. [#94439][#94439]

<h3 id="v22-1-13-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved the performance of [`crdb_internal.default_privileges`](../v22.1/crdb-internal.html) population. [#94338][#94338]
