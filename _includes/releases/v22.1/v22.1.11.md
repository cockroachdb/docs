## v22.1.11

Release Date: November 14, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-11-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- HTTP API endpoints under the `/api/v2/` prefix now allow requests through when the cluster is running in insecure mode. When the cluster is running in insecure mode, requests to these endpoints will have the username set to `root`. [#87274][#87274]

<h3 id="v22-1-11-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a new [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) `cloudstorage.azure.concurrent_upload_buffers` to configure the number of concurrent buffers used when uploading files to Azure. [#90449][#90449]

<h3 id="v22-1-11-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Requests to fetch table and database [statistics](../v22.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#table-statistics) now have limited concurrency. This may make loading the [Databases page](../v22.1/ui-databases-page.html) slower, but in return should result in making those pages less disruptive. [#90575][#90575]
- Updated the filter labels from **App** to **Application Name** and from **Username** to **User Name** on the [SQL Activity page](../v22.1/ui-overview.html#sql-activity). [#91294][#91294]
- Fixed the filter and label style on the **Transactions** filter label on the [SQL Activity page](../v22.1/ui-overview.html#sql-activity). [#91319][#91319]
- Fixed the filters in the DB Console so that if the height of the filter is large, it will allow a scroll to reach **Apply**. [#90479][#90479]
- Added a horizontal scroll to the table on **Explain Plan** tab under [**Statement Details**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html). [#91329][#91329]
- Fixed the filter height on the [Sessions page](../v22.1/ui-sessions-page.html) so that the full dropdown is viewable with scroll. [#91325][#91325]

<h3 id="v22-1-11-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an extremely rare out-of-bounds crash in the [protected timestamp](../v22.1/architecture/storage-layer.html#protected-timestamps) subsystem. [#90452][#90452]
- Fixed the calculation of the `pg_attribute.attnum` column for indexes so that the `attnum` is always based on the order the column appears in the index. Also fixed the `pg_attribute` table so that it includes stored columns in secondary indexes. [#90728][#90728]
- [TTL job](../v22.1/row-level-ttl.html#view-scheduled-ttl-jobs) decoding error messages now correctly contain hex-encoded key bytes instead of hex-encoded key pretty print output. [#90727][#90727]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB clusters running inside of a Docker container on macOS, when mounting a host filesystem into the container, could report the total available capacity calculation of the filesystem incorrectly. [#90868][#90868]
- Fixed the error `invalid uvarint length of 9` that could occur during TTL jobs. This bug could affect keys with secondary tenant prefixes, which includes the serverless environment. [#90606][#90606]
- Previously, if a primary key name was a reserved SQL keyword, you could not use [`DROP CONSTRAINT, ADD CONSTRAINT`](../v22.1/drop-constraint.html#drop-and-add-a-primary-key-constraint) to change a primary key without having to move the existing primary key to the secondary index. You would receive a `constraint already exists` error. This is now fixed so that you can use `DROP CONSTRAINT, ADD CONSTRAINT` on a primary key named with a reserved SQL keyword. [#91041][#91041]
- Fixed a bug where in large, [multi-region clusters](../v22.1/multiregion-overview.html), it was possible for the leasing mechanism used for jobs to get caught in a live-lock scenario, which could result in jobs not being adopted. [#91066][#91066]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results and internal errors when a [`LEFT JOIN`](../v22.1/joins.html) operated on a table with [virtual computed columns](../v22.1/computed-columns.html). The bug only presented when the optimizer planned a "paired joiner". Only values of the virtual columns would be incorrect—they could be `NULL` when their correct value was not `NULL`. An internal error would occur in the same situation if the virtual column had a `NOT NULL` constraint. This bug was present since v22.1.0. [#91017][#91017]

<h3 id="v22-1-11-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Loading the Databases page in the UI is now less expensive when there are a large number of databases and a large number of tables in each database and a large number of ranges in the cluster. [#91014][#91014]
