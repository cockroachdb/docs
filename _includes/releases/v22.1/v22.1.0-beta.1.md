Release Date: April 4, 2022

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The volatility of cast operations between strings and interval/timestamp types has changed from immutable to stable. This means that these cast operations can no longer be used in computed columns or partial index definitions. Instead, use the following [builtin functions:](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html) `parse_interval`, `parse_date`, `parse_time`, `parse_timetz`, `parse_timestamp`, or `to_char`. Upon upgrade to v22.1, CockroachDB will automatically rewrite any computed columns or partial indexes that use the affected casts to use the new builtin functions. [#78455][#78455]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Tenant GC job will now wait for protected timestamp records that target the tenant and have a protect time less than the tenant's drop time. Release justification: high-priority changes in existing functionality [#78389][#78389]
- Allow users to provide an end-time for changefeeds through the 'end_time' option. When this option is provided, the changefeed will run until it has reached the end-time, and then the changefeed job will end with a successful status code. Furthermore, we now provide an 'initial_scan_only' option. When this option is set, the changefeed job will end with a successful status code immediately after the initial scan completed.  Release Justification: This feature is low danger, yet highly desired from users. [#78381][#78381]
- Do not block schema changes when executing core-style changefeeds.  Release Justification: low danger stability fix. [#78360][#78360]
- Remove expensive, unnecessary, and never used `schedules.round.schedules-ready-to-run` and `schedules.round.num-jobs-running` metrics from job schedulers.  Release Justification: Stability fix for scheduled job system. [#78565][#78565]
- Changefeeds can now protect targets from GC on user tenants [#78536][#78536]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Add support for `ALTER DATABASE ... ALTER SUPER REGION`.  This command allows the user to change the regions of an existing super region.  
	
	For example, after successful execution of the following, super region `test1` will consist of three regions, `ca-central-1`, `us-west-1`, and `us-east-1`.

	`ALTER DATABASE db3 ALTER SUPER REGION "test1" VALUES "ca-central-1", "us-west-1", "us-east-1";`
	
	`Alter super region` follows the same rules as `add` or `drop` super region. [#78462][#78462]
- The session variables `datestyle_enabled` and `intervalstyle_enabled`, and the cluster settings `sql.defaults.datestyle.enabled` and `sql.defaults.intervalstyle.enabled` no longer have any effect. After upgrading to v22.1, these settings are effectively always interpreted as "true." [#78455][#78455]
- Stats compaction scheduled job no longer cause intent buildup. Release Justification: important stability fix to ensure jobs and scheduled jobs do not lock up when running stats compaction job. [#78565][#78565]
- Bucket-count of hash-sharded index is now shown from the `crdb_internal.table_indexes` table. [#78625][#78625]
- Implemented the `COPY FROM ... ESCAPE ...` syntax. [#78417][#78417]
- Disabled index recommendations in `EXPLAIN` output for `REGIONAL BY ROW` tables, as the previous recommendations were not valid. [#78676][#78676]
- Added a `crdb_internal.validate_ttl_scheduled_jobs` builtin which verifies that each table points to a valid scheduled job which will action the deletion of expired rows. [#78373][#78373]
- Adds a `crdb_internal.repair_ttl_table_scheduled_job` builtin, which repairs the given TTL table's scheduled job by supplanting it with a valid schedule. [#78373][#78373]
- `ALTER TABLE ... INJECT STATISTICS ...` will now issue notices when the given statistics JSON includes non-existent columns, rather than resulting in an error. Any statistics in the JSON for existing columns will be injected successfully. [#79071][#79071]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- This patch adds a new metric that charts the number of bytes received via snapshot on any given store. [#78464][#78464]
- Bulk ingest operations like `IMPORT`, `RESTORE` or `CREATE INDEX` will now fail if they try to write to a node that has less than 5% storage capacity remaining, configurable via the setting `kv.bulk_io_write.min_capacity_remaining_fraction`. [#78579][#78579]
- `IMPORT` jobs will now pause if a node runs out of disk space. [#78587][#78587]
- `CREATE INDEX` and some other schema changes will now pause if a node is running out of disk space. [#78587][#78587]
- `RESTORE` will now pause if a node is running out of disk space. [#78587][#78587]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- `cockroach demo` is reverted back to not run multi-tenant mode by default. [#78168][#78168]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The replication dashboard now includes a graph of snapshot bytes received per node. [#78580][#78580]
- The `_status/nodes` endpoint is avaible to all users with the `VIEWACTIVITY` role option, not just admins. In the DB Console, the Nodes Overview and Node Reports pages will now display unredacted information containing node hostnames and IP addresses for all users with the `VIEWACTIVITY` role option. Previously this was also gated for admins only. [#78362][#78362]
- Improved colors for status badges on the Jobs page. Three status on the Jobs page, `cancel-requested`, `pause-requested`, and `revert-failed`, previously had blue status badge colors that were uninformative of their meaning. This commit modifies the badge colors to reflect their meaning. Now `cancel-requested` and `pause-requested` have gray badges and `revert-failed` has a red badge. [#78611][#78611]
- Fixes a bug where a node in the `UNAVAILABLE` state will not have latency defined and cause the network page to crash. [#78628][#78628]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB might now fetch less rows when performing lookup and index joins on the queries with `LIMIT` clause. [#78473][#78473]
- Fixed a bug whereby certain catalog interactions which occurred concurrently with node failures were not internally retried. [#78698][#78698]
- A bug has been fixed which caused the optimizer to generate invalid query plans which could result in incorrect query results. The bug, which has been present since version 21.1.0, can appear if all of the following conditions are true:
  1. The query contains a semi-join, such as queries in the form: `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a);`
  1. The inner table has an index containing the equality column, like `t2.a` in the example query. 
  1. The index contains one or more columns that prefix the equality column.
  1. The prefix columns are `NOT NULL` and are constrained to a set of constant values via a `CHECK` constraint or an `IN` condition in the filter. [#78972][#78972]
- The LATEST file that points to the latest full backup in a collection was written to a directory path with the wrong structure. [#78281][#78281]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Ranges are split and rebalanced during bulk ingestion only when they become full, reducing unnecessary splits and merges. [#78328][#78328]
- Unused JS files are no longer downloaded when the admin UI loads. [#78665][#78665]
