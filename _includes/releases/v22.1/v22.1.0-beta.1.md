## v22.1.0-beta.1

Release Date: April 4, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The volatility of cast operations between [strings](../v22.1/string.html) and [intervals](../v22.1/interval.html) or [timestamps](../v22.1/timestamp.html) has changed from immutable to stable. This means that these cast operations can no longer be used in computed columns or partial index definitions. Instead, use the following [built-in functions:](../v22.1/functions-and-operators.html) `parse_interval`, `parse_date`, `parse_time`, `parse_timetz`, `parse_timestamp`, or `to_char`. Upon upgrade to v22.1, CockroachDB will automatically rewrite any computed columns or partial indexes that use the affected casts to use the new built-in functions. [#78455][#78455]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Tenant GC job will now wait for protected timestamp records that target the tenant and have a protect time less than the tenant's drop time. [#78389][#78389]
- Allow users to provide an end time for [changefeeds](../v22.1/change-data-capture-overview.html) through the `end_time` option. When this option is provided, the changefeed will run until it has reached the end timestamp the user specified, and then the changefeed job will end with a successful status code. Furthermore, we now provide an `initial_scan_only` option. When this option is set, the changefeed job will run until the initial scan has completed, and then end with a successful status code. [#78381][#78381]
- Do not block schema changes when executing core-style changefeeds. [#78360][#78360]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added support for `ALTER DATABASE ... ALTER SUPER REGION`.  This command allows the user to change the regions of an existing super region. For example, after successful execution of the following, super region `test1` will consist of three regions, `ca-central-1`, `us-west-1`, and `us-east-1`.
	{% include_cached copy-clipboard.html %}
	~~~sql
	ALTER DATABASE db3 ALTER SUPER REGION "test1" VALUES "ca-central-1", "us-west-1", "us-east-1";
	~~~
 	`ALTER SUPER REGION` follows the same rules as `ADD` or `DROP` super region. [#78462][#78462]

- The [session variables](../v22.1/set-vars.html) `datestyle_enabled` and `intervalstyle_enabled`, and the [cluster settings](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) `sql.defaults.datestyle.enabled` and `sql.defaults.intervalstyle.enabled` no longer have any effect. After upgrading to v22.1, these settings are effectively always interpreted as `true`. [#78455][#78455]
- `BUCKET_COUNT` for [hash-sharded index](../v22.1/hash-sharded-indexes.html) is now shown from the `crdb_internal.table_indexes` table. [#78625][#78625]
- Implemented the [`COPY FROM ... ESCAPE ...`](../v22.1/copy-from.html) syntax. [#78417][#78417]
- Disabled index recommendations in [`EXPLAIN`](../v22.1/explain.html) output for [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v22.1/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables), as the previous recommendations were not valid. [#78676][#78676]
- Added a `crdb_internal.validate_ttl_scheduled_jobs` built-in function. This verifies that each table points to a valid scheduled job which will action the deletion of expired rows. [#78373][#78373]
- Added a `crdb_internal.repair_ttl_table_scheduled_job` built-in function, which repairs the given TTL table's scheduled job by supplanting it with a valid schedule. [#78373][#78373]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new metric that charts the number of bytes received via snapshot on any given store. [#78464][#78464]
- Bulk ingest operations like [`IMPORT`](../v22.1/import.html), [`RESTORE`](../v22.1/restore.html) or [`CREATE INDEX`](../v22.1/create-index.html) will now fail if they try to write to a node that has less than 5% storage capacity remaining, configurable via the [`kv.bulk_io_write.min_capacity_remaining_fraction`](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html). [#78579][#78579]
- [`IMPORT`](../v22.1/import.html) jobs will now [pause](../v22.1/pause-job.html) if a node runs out of disk space. [#78587][#78587]
- [`CREATE INDEX`](../v22.1/create-index.html) and some other schema changes will now [pause](../v22.1/pause-job.html) if a node is running out of disk space. [#78587][#78587]
- [`RESTORE`](../v22.1/restore.html) will now [pause](../v22.1/pause-job.html) if a node is running out of disk space. [#78587][#78587]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- [`cockroach demo`](../v22.1/cockroach-demo.html) is reverted back to not run multi-tenant mode by default. [#78168][#78168]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [Replication Dashboard](../v22.1/ui-replication-dashboard.html) now includes a graph of snapshot bytes received per node. [#78580][#78580]
- The [`_status/nodes` endpoint](../v22.1/monitoring-and-alerting.html) is now available to all users with the `VIEWACTIVITY` role option, not just admins. Also, in the DB Console, the **Nodes Overview** and **Node Reports** pages will now display unredacted information containing node hostnames and IP addresses for all users with the `VIEWACTIVITY` role option.[#78362][#78362]
- Improved colors for status badges on the [Jobs](../v22.1/ui-jobs-page.html) page. Three statuses on the Jobs page, `cancel-requested`, `pause-requested`, and `revert-failed`, previously had blue status badge colors that didn't properly reflect their meaning. This commit modifies the badge colors to indicate meaning. Now `cancel-requested` and `pause-requested` have gray badges and `revert-failed` has a red badge. [#78611][#78611]
- Fixed a bug where a node in the `UNAVAILABLE` state would not have latency defined, causing the network page to crash. [#78628][#78628]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB may now fetch fewer rows when performing lookup and index joins on queries with a `LIMIT` clause. [#78473][#78473]
- Fixed a bug whereby certain catalog interactions which occurred concurrently with node failures were not internally retried. [#78698][#78698]
- Fixed a bug that caused the optimizer to generate invalid query plans which could result in incorrect query results. The bug, which has been present since version v21.1.0, can appear if all of the following conditions are true:
  1. The query contains a semi-join, such as queries in the form: `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.a);`.
  1. The inner table has an index containing the equality column, like `t2.a` in the example query.
  1. The index contains one or more columns that prefix the equality column.
  1. The prefix columns are `NOT NULL` and are constrained to a set of constant values via a `CHECK` constraint or an `IN` condition in the filter. [#78972][#78972]
- Fixed a bug where the `LATEST` file that points to the latest full [backup](../v22.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#full-backups) in a collection was written to a directory path with the wrong structure. [#78281][#78281]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-1-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- [Ranges](../v22.1/show-ranges.html) are split and rebalanced during bulk ingestion only when they become full, reducing unnecessary splits and merges. [#78328][#78328]
- Unused JS files are no longer downloaded when the DB Console loads. [#78665][#78665]
