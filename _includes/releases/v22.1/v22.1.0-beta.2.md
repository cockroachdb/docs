Release Date: April 12, 2022

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-2-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Job scheduler is more efficient and should no longer lock up jobs and scheduled jobs tables. [#79328][#79328]
- Removed the default values from the [`SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS`](../v22.1/show-jobs.html#show-changefeed-jobs) output. [#79361][#79361]
- Checkpoint files are no longer overwritten and now versioned and written side-by-side in the `/progress` directory. Temporary checkpoint files are no longer written. [#79314][#79314]
- Changefeeds can now be distributed across pods in tenant environments. [#79303][#79303]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Help text for creating indexes or primary key constraints no longer mentions `BUCKET_COUNT` because it can now be omitted and a default is used. [#79087][#79087]
- Add support for show default privileges in schema.  The [`SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](../v22.1/show-default-privileges.html) clause now supports optionally passing a schema name:  `SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES [opt_for_role] [opt_schema_name]` Example:

    ~~~ sql
    SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA s2
    ~~~
    ~~~
    ----
    role      for_all_roles  object_type  grantee    privilege_type
    testuser  false          tables       testuser2  DROP
    testuser  false          tables       testuser2  SELECT
    testuser  false          tables       testuser2  UPDATE
    ~~~
    ~~~ sql
    SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE testuser IN SCHEMA s2
    ~~~
    ~~~
    ----
    role      for_all_roles  object_type  grantee    privilege_type
    testuser  false          tables       testuser2  DROP
    testuser  false          tables       testuser2  SELECT
    testuser  false          tables       testuser2  UPDATE
    ~~~
    [#79177][#79177]

- Add support for `SHOW SUPER REGIONS FROM DATABASE`. Example:

    ~~~ sql
    SHOW SUPER REGIONS FROM DATABASE mr2
    ~~~
    ~~~
    ----
    mr2  ca-central-sr  {ca-central-1}
    mr2  test           {ap-southeast-2,us-east-1}
    ~~~
  [#79190][#79190]
- When you run [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v22.1/show-backup.html) on collections you must now use the `FROM` keyword: `SHOW BACKUP FROM <subdir> IN <dest>`. [#79116][#79116]
- `SHOW BACKUP` without the `IN` keyword to specify a subdirectory is deprecated and will be removed from a future release. Users are recommended to only create collection based backups and view them with `SHOW BACKUP FROM <backup> IN <collection>`. [#79116][#79116]
- Add extra logging for copy to the [`SQL_EXEC`](../v22.1/logging-overview.html#logging-channels) channel if the `sql.trace.log_statement_execute` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) is set. [#79298][#79298]
- An error message is now logged to the `SQL_EXEC` channel when parsing fails. [#79298][#79298]
- Introduced a `expect_and_ignore_not_visible_columns_in_copy` [session variable](../v22.1/set-vars.html). If this is set, [`COPY FROM`](../v22.1/copy-from.html) with no column specifiers will assume hidden columns are in the copy data, but will ignore them when applying `COPY FROM`. [#79189][#79189]
- Changes the default value of `sql.zone_configs.allow_for_secondary_tenant.enabled` to be `false`.  Moreover, this setting is no longer settable by secondary tenants. Instead, it's now a tenant read-only cluster setting. [#79160][#79160]
- [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v22.1/show-backup.html) now reports accurate row and byte size counts on backups created by a tenant. [#79339][#79339]
- Memory and disk usage are now reported for the lookup joins in [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v22.1/explain-analyze.html). [#79351][#79351]
- Privileges on a database are no longer inherited to tables/schemas if a table/schema is created in that database.  For example, `GRANT ALL ON DATABASE TEST TO foo`; `CREATE TABLE test.t()` no longer results in `foo` having `ALL` on the table. Users should rely on default privileges instead. You can achieve the same behavior by doing `USE test; ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO foo;` [#79509][#79509]
- The `InvalidPassword` error code is now returned if the password is invalid or the user does not exist when authenticating. [#79515][#79515]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-2-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The `kv.allocator.load_based_rebalancing_interval` [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) now lets operators set the interval at which each store in the cluster will check for load-based lease or replica rebalancing opportunities. [#79073][#79073]
- [Rangefeed](../v22.1/use-changefeeds.html#enable-rangefeeds) memory budgets have a [cluster setting](../v22.1/cluster-settings.html) `kv.rangefeed.memory_budgets.enabled` that disables memory budgeting for all new feeds. This setting could be used on [{{ site.data.products.dedicated }}](../v22.1/choose-a-deployment-option.html#dedicated) clusters to disable budgeting as a mitigation for bugs for example if feeds abort while nodes have sufficient free memory. [#79321][#79321]
- Rangefeed memory budgets could be disabled on the fly when cluster setting is changed without the need to restart the feed. [#79321][#79321]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-2-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Minor styling changes on [**Hot Ranges**](../v22.1/ui-hot-ranges-page.html) page to follow the same style as other pages. [#79501][#79501]
- On the [**Statement Details**](../v22.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) page, changed the order of tabs to **Overview**, **Explain Plan**, **Diagnostics**, and **Execution Stats** and changed the **Explain Plan** tab to **Explain Plan**s (plural). [#79234][#79234]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixes a NPE during the cleanup of a failed or cancelled [`RESTORE` ](../v22.1/restore.html) job. [#78992][#78992]
- Fix [`num_runs`](../v22.1/show-jobs.html) being incremented twice for certain jobs upon being started. [#79052][#79052]
- A bug has been fixed that caused errors when trying to evaluate queries with `NULL` values annotated as a tuple type, such as `NULL:::RECORD`. This bug was present since version 19.1. [#78531][#78531]
- [`ALTER TABLE [ADD|DROP] COLUMN`](../v22.1/alter-table.html) are now subject to [admission control](../v22.1/admission-control.html), which will prevent these operations from overloading the storage engine. [#79209][#79209]
- Index usage stats are now properly captured for index joins. [#79241][#79241]
- [`SHOW SCHEMAS FROM <schema>`](../v22.1/show-schemas.html) now includes user-defined schemas. [#79308][#79308]
- A distributed query that results in an error on the remote node no longer has an incomplete trace. [#79193][#79193]
- [`IMPORT INTO`](../v22.1/import-into.html) no longer creates duplicate entries with [`UNIQUE`](../v22.1/unique.html) constraints in [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v22.1/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) and tables utilizing `UNIQUE WITHOUT INDEX` constraints. A new post-`IMPORT` validation step for those tables now fails and rolls back the `IMPORT` in such cases. [#79323][#79323]
- Fixed a bug in IO which could result in [admission control](../v22.1/admission-control.html) failing to rate limit when traffic was stalled such that no work was admitted, despite the store's being in an unhealthy state. [#79343][#79343]
- The execution time as reported on [`DISTSQL`](../v22.1/explain-analyze.html#explain-analyze-distsql) diagrams within the statement bundle collected via [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`](../v22.1/explain-analyze.html#debug-option) is no longer negative when the statement encountered an error. [#79373][#79373]
- CockroachDB reports fewer "memory budget exceeded" errors when performing [lookup joins](../v22.1/joins.html#lookup-joins). [#79351][#79351]
- `LIMIT` queries with an `ORDER BY` clause that scan the index of a virtual system tables, such as `pg_type`, no longer return incorrect results. [#79460][#79460]
- [`nextval` and `setval`](../v22.1/create-sequence.html#sequence-functions) are non-transactional except when it is called in the same transaction that the sequence was created in. This change prevents a bug where creating a sequence and calling `nextval` and `setval` on it within a transaction caused the query containing `nextval` to hang. [#79506][#79506]
- A bug has been fixed that caused the optimizer to generate query plans with logically incorrect lookup joins. The bug can only occur in queries with an inner join, e.g., `t1 JOIN t2`, if all of the following are true:

  - The join contains an equality condition between columns of both tables, e.g., `t1.a = t2.a`.
  - A query filter or `CHECK` constraint constrains a column to a set of specific values, e.g., `t2.b IN (1, 2, 3)`. In the case of a `CHECK` constraint, the column must be `NOT NULL`.
  - A query filter or `CHECK` constraint constrains a column to a range, e.g., `t2.c > 0`. In the case of a `CHECK` constraint, the column must be `NOT NULL`.
  - An index contains a column from each of the criteria above, e.g., `INDEX t2(a, b, c)`. This bug has been present since version 21.2.0. [#79504][#79504]
- A bug has been fixed which caused the optimizer to generate invalid query plans which could result in incorrect query results. The bug, which has been present since  v21.1.0, can appear if all of the following conditions are true:

  - The query contains a semi-join, such as queries in the form `SELECT * FROM a WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM b WHERE a.a @> b.b)`.
  - The inner table has a multi-column inverted index containing the inverted column in the filter.
  - The index prefix columns are constrained to a set of values via the filter or a `CHECK` constraint, e.g., with an `IN` operator. In the      case of a `CHECK` constraint, the column is `NOT NULL`.
  [#79504][#79504]

<h3 id="v22-1-0-beta-2-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Uniqueness checks performed for inserts into [`REGIONAL BY ROW` tables](../v22.1/multiregion-overview.html#regional-by-row-tables) no longer search all regions for duplicates. In some cases, these checks will now only search a subset of regions when inserting a single row of constant values. [#79251][#79251]
- Bulk ingestion writes now use a lower priority for [admission control](../v22.1/admission-control.html). [#79352][#79352]
- Browser caching of files loaded in DB Console is now supported. [#79382][#79382]
