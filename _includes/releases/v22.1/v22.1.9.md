<h3 id="v22-1-9-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The following types of data are now considered "safe" for reporting from within `debug.zip`:

    - Range start/end keys, which can include data from any indexed SQL column.
    - Key spans, which can include data from any indexed SQL column.
    - Usernames and role names.
    - SQL object names (including names of databases, schemas, tables, sequences, views, types, and UDFs.

    [#88739][#88739]

<h3 id="v22-1-9-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The new cluster setting `sql.metrics.statement_details.gateway_node.enabled` controls whether the gateway node ID is persisted to the `system.statement_statistics` table as-is or as a `0` to decrease cardinality on the table. The node ID is still available on the statistics column. [#88634][#88634]

<h3 id="v22-1-9-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- The new cluster setting `kv.mvcc_gc.queue_interval` controls how long the MVCC garbage collection queue waits between processing replicas. The previous value of `1s` is the new default. A large volume of MVCC garbage collection work can disrupt foreground traffic. [#89430][#89430]

<h3 id="v22-1-9-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The new `--redact` flag of the `debug zip` command triggers redaction of all sensitive data in debug zip bundles, except for range keys. The `--redact-logs` flag will be deprecated in v22.2. [#88739][#88739]

<h3 id="v22-1-9-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.1.7 that could cause an internal panic when a query ordering contained redundant ordering columns. [#88480][#88480]
- Fixed a bug that could cause nodes to crash when executing apply-joins in query plans. [#88513][#88513]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v21.2.0 that could cause errors when executing queries with correlated `WITH` expressions. [#88513][#88513]
- Fixed a longstanding bug that could cause the optimizer to produce an incorrect plan when aggregate functions `st_makeline` or `st_extent` were called with invalid-type and empty inputs respectively. [#88952][#88952]
- Fixed unintended recordings of index reads caused by internal executor/queries. [#88943][#88943]
- Fixed a bug with capturing index usage statistics for database names with hyphens [#88999][#88999]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect evaluation of expressions in the form `col +/- const1 ? const2`, where `const1` and `const2` are constant values and `?` is any comparison operator. The bug was caused by operator overflow when the optimizer attempted to simplify these expressions to have a single constant value. [#88970][#88970]
- Fixed a bug where the `system.replication_constraint_stats` table did not show erroneous voter constraint violations when `num_voters` was configured. [#88662][#88662]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect results from the floor division operator, `//`, when the numerator was non-constant and the denominator was the constant 1. [#89263][#89263]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v2.1.0 that could cause queries containing a subquery with an `EXCEPT` clause to produce incorrect results. This could happen if the optimizer could guarantee that the left side of the `EXCEPT` clause always returned more rows than the right side. In this case, the optimizer made an incorrect assumption that the `EXCEPT` subquery always returned at least one row, which could cause the optimizer to perform an invalid transformation, leading to the potential for incorrect results in the full query result. [#89134][#89134]
- Fixed a bug that prevented saving of a statement bundle that was collected for a query that resulted in a `statement_timeout` error. [#89126][#89126]
- Fixed a longstanding bug that could cause a panic when running a query with an `EXPLAIN` clause that attempts to order on a non-output column. [#88686][#88686]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.1.0 that could cause incorrect results in a narrow circumstance:<ol><li>A query with <code>ORDER BY</code> and <code>LIMIT</code> is executed.</li><li>The table that contains the <code>ORDER BY</code> columns has an index containing that contains those columns.</li><li>The index contains a prefix of columns held to a fixed number of values by the query filter, such as <code>WHERE a IN (1, 3)</code>.</li><li>A <code>CHECK</code> constraint (such as <code>CHECK (a IN (1, 3))</code>) is inferred by either:<ul><li>A computed column expression (such as <code>WHERE a IN (1, 3)</code> and a column <code>b INT AS (a + 10) STORED</code>).</li><li>A <code>PARTITION BY</code> clause (such as <code>INDEX (a, ...) PARTITION BY LIST (a) (PARTITION p VALUES ((1), (3)))</code>).</li></ul></li></ol>[#89281][#89281]
- The WAL is now flushed when writing storage checkpoints on consistency checker failures [#89402][#89402]
- Fixed a bug that could cause a restore operation to fail with a spurious error. [#89443][#89443]
- Fixed a bug that caused changefeeds to be permanently in a a "failed to send RPC" state. [#87804][#87804]
- Improved optimizer selectivity and cost estimates of zigzag joins to prevent query plans from using the optimizer when many rows are qualified). [#89460][#89460]
- A `VOTER_DEMOTING_LEARNER` can acquire the lease in a joint configuration only when there is a `VOTOR_INCOMING` in the configuration and the `VOTER_DEMOTING_LEARNER` was the last leaseholder. This prevents a situation in which the system is unable to exit the joint configuration. [#89611][#89611]
- Fixed a bug introduced in v22.1.0 that cause CockroachDB to crash that could occur when dropping a role that owned two schemas with the same name in different databases. [#89538][#89538]
- Fixed a bug in `pg_catalog` tables which could result in an internal error if a schema is concurrently dropped. [#88600][#88600]
- Refined a check conducted during restore that ensures that all previously-offline tables were properly introduced. [#89688][#89688]
- Fixed a bug in v22.1.0 to v22.1.8 that could cause a query with ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses to return incorrect results if it scanned a multi-column index containing the `ORDER BY` columns, and a prefix of the index columns was held fixed to two or more constant values by the query filter or schema. [#88488][88488]

<h3 id="v22-1-9-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- HTTP requests with `Accept-encoding: gzip` previously resulted in valid gzip-encoded but uncompressed responses. This resulted in inefficient HTTP transfer times. Those responses are now properly compressed, resulting in smaller network responses. [#89513][#89513]

<h3 id="v22-1-9-miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

- The SQL proxy now validates the tenant certificate's common name and organization, in addition to its DNS name. The DNS name for a Kubernetes pod is the pod's IP address, and IP addresses are reused by the cluster. [#89677][#89677]

- Reverted a fix for a bug that caused histograms to incorrectly omit buckets whose cumulative count matched the preceding bucket. The fix led to a significant increase in memory usage on clusters with Prometheus or OpenTelemetry collector instances. [#89532][#89532]
