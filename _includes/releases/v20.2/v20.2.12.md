<h3 id="v20-2-12-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- Added new [`CHANGEFEED` options](../v20.2/create-changefeed.html#options) that give you more control over topic naming: The `full_table_name` option lets you use a fully-qualified table name in topics, subjects, schemas, and record output instead of the default table name, and can prevent unintended behavior when the same table name is present in multiple databases. The `avro_schema_prefix` option lets you use a fully-qualified schema name for a table instead of the default table name, and makes it possible for multiple databases or clusters to share the same schema registry when the same table name is present in multiple databases. [#66091][#66091]
- Changefeeds with custom Kafka client configurations (using the `kafka_sink_config` object) that could lead to long delays in flushing messages will now produce an error. [#66316][#66316]
- The `kafka_sink_config` object now supports a `version` configuration item to specify Kafka server versions. This is likely only necessary for old (Kafka 0.11/Confluent 3.3 or earlier) Kafka servers. Additionally, settings not specified in `kafka_sink_config` now retain their default values. [#66316][#66316]

<h3 id="v20-2-12-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Creating `STORED` [computed columns](../v20.2/computed-columns.html) with expressions that reference [foreign key](../v20.2/foreign-key.html) columns is now allowed. [#66169][#66169]

<h3 id="v20-2-12-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) now puts backup data files in a `data` sub-directory of the `BACKUP` path instead of directly in the backup path. [#66164][#66164]

<h3 id="v20-2-12-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB now prevents intra-query leaks during disk spilling that could cause the database to run out of memory, especially during disk spilling operations on tables with wide rows. [#66170][#66170]
- Queries now use up to 1MB less actual system memory per scan, lookup join, index join, zigzag join, or inverted join in their query plans. This will result in improved memory performance for workloads with concurrent OLAP-style queries. [#66170][#66170]
- `BACKUP`s no longer risk the possibility of blocking conflicting writes while being rate limited by the `kv.bulk_io_write.concurrent_export_requests` concurrency limit. [#66409][#66409]
- `BACKUP` and other operations can now reuse a previously created S3 client session when operating on the same bucket, which can avoid `NoCredentialProviders` errors on EC2 when iterating with large incremental backups. [#66260][#66260]
- Fixed a crash when performing a cluster [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) with revision history of a cluster upgraded from 20.1 to 20.2 to 21.1 which contains tables that were truncated by 20.1. [#66638][#66638]
- Fixed the style of the DB Console password field on Safari. [#66135][#66135]

<h3 id="v20-2-12-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The `COCKROACHDB_REGISTRY` file is no longer rewritten whenever a new unencrypted file is created. [#66424][#66424]
