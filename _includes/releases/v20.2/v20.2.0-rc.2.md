<h3 id="v20-2-0-rc-2-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The Docker image is now based on RedHat's ubi8/ubi-minimal image (instead of ubi8/ubi). This image is smaller. [#55519][#55519]

<h3 id="v20-2-0-rc-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Prevented a crash in pre-release v20.2 binaries in plans that use the new virtual table lookup join feature. [#55321][#55321]
- CockroachDB now returns an appropriate error when attempting to partition by an [`ENUM`](../v20.2/enum.html) column instead of crashing. [#55357][#55357]
- Fixed an issue where [DB Console](../v20.2/ui-overview.html) screens were not working properly when the user was logged in with a username containing uppercase or non-normalized unicode characters. [#55384][#55384]
- The OIDC-based UI process now respects the [`LOGIN` role option](../v20.2/create-role.html). [#55384][#55384]
- Added the `hostname` command to the Docker image so the image can be used with the CockroachDB Helm chart and `cockroach-operator`. [#55390][#55390]
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect query results on tables with partial indexes. This bug did not affect any queries involving tables without partial indexes. [#55394][#55394]
- Previously, observer statements (e.g., `SHOW SYNTAX`) and `PREPARE` statements would display a negative execution time on the client. This is now fixed. [#55431][#55431]
- The [`CREATE USER` statement](../v20.2/create-user.html) without explicit `NOLOGIN` option implicitly grants `LOGIN`, and so requires the `CREATELOGIN` privilege. This was not checked properly, and is now enforced. This bug was introduced earlier in the v20.2 development cycle. [#55369][#55369]
- The `information_schema.tables` metadata table no longer ignores tables from other schemas when searching based on table name. [#55522][#55522]
