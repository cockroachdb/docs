<h3 id="v20-2-9-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Prior to this change, `st_simplify` with `NaN` caused a node to crash. The behavior has been changed to align with PostGIS. [#63798][#63798]
- Validation queries that run on behalf of schema changes, such as [foreign key](../v20.2/foreign-key.html) validations, [unique constraint](../v20.2/unique.html) validations, and [check constraint](../v20.2/check.html) validations, will now use the [vectorized engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) and DistSQL distribution based on the defaults set in the cluster settings. This may speed up validation queries. [#64005][#64005]
- [`TRUNCATE`](../v20.2/truncate.html) is now less disruptive on tables with a lot of concurrent traffic. [#64445][#64445]

<h3 id="v20-2-9-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a correctness bug which caused partitioned index scans to omit rows where the value of the first index column was `NULL`. This bug was present since v19.2.0. [#64049][#64049]
- Fixed a bug where multiple concurrent invocations of [`cockroach debug zip`](../v20.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html) could result in cluster instability. This bug had been present since CockroachDB v20.1. [#64084][#64084]
- Fixed a rare bug which could cause a crash if [`CREATE SCHEMA`](../v20.2/create-schema.html) were run in a transaction which began prior to a cluster version update which enabled that statement. [#63786][#63786]
- Fixed a race condition where read-only requests during replica removal (e.g., during range merges or rebalancing) could be evaluated on the removed replica, returning an empty result. [#64375][#64375]
- Fixed a bug where [encryption-at-rest](../v20.2/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise) metadata was not synced and might become corrupted during a hard reset. [#64496][#64496]
- Fixed a panic which could occur in cases after a [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) of a table using user-defined types. [#63550][#63550]
- Fixed bugs where [`TRUNCATE`](../v20.2/truncate.html) concurrent with index construction and other schema changes could result in corruption. [#63153][#63153]
- Fixed a bug where upon failure of the [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v20.2/create-table-as.html) or `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statements, tables would be left in an invalid non-public state until GC instead of being marked as dropped, possibly causing spurious validation failures. The bug was introduced in earlier v20.2 testing releases. [#63987][#63987]
- Fixed `crdb_internal.encode_key` for user-defined types. This would previously return an error. [#64031][#64031]
- Fixed a theoretical issue in index backfills that could result in stale entries that would likely fail validation. [#64045][#64045]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would either return an error or crash when comparing an infinite date coming from a subquery against a timestamp. [#64075][#64075]
- The [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v20.2/create-statistics.html) statement no longer fails when creating statistics on a table with a partial index predicate containing references to an inverted-type column, such as `JSON`, `ARRAY`, `GEOMETRY`, or `GEOGRAPHY`. This bug was present since partial indexes were introduced in v20.2.0. [#64226][#64226]
- Fixed an issue where store information would be incorrectly redacted from the CockroachDB logs, when configured with redaction. [#64333][#64333]
- Previously, passwords in SQL statements in telemetry updates and crash reports were anonymized as `*****`. Passwords are now anonymized as `'*****'` so that the SQL statements do not result in parsing errors when executed. [#64345][#64345]
- Previously, the remote flows of execution in the vectorized engine could take quite a long time to shut down whenever a node participating in the plan dies. This has been fixed. [#64220][#64220]
- CockroachDB now correctly accounts for used memory when closing compressed files. [#63916][#63916]

<h3 id="v20-2-9-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Certain queries containing `<tuple> IN (<subquery>)` conditions may run significantly faster. [#63869][#63869]
- The Raft processing goroutine pool's size is now capped at 96. This was observed to prevent instability on large machines (32+ vCPU) in clusters with many ranges (50k+ per node). [#64567][#64567]
- The Raft scheduler now prioritizes the node liveness Range. This was observed to prevent instability on large machines (32+ vCPU) in clusters with many ranges (50k+ per node). [#64567][#64567]
- Reduced memory usage in some write-heavy workloads. Improved write performance when a lot of files are being deleted. Addressed one case where too many small sstable files were generated. [#64599][#64599]

<h3 id="v20-2-9-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now builds on Ubuntu 20.10 and other distros using gcc-10. [#62201][#62201]
