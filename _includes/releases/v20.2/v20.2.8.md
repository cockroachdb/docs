## v20.2.8

Release Date: April 23, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v20-2-8-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) now re-validates restored indexes if they were restored from an incremental backup that was taken while the index was being created. [#63314][#63314]
- Fixed an `ST_Segmentize` panic when the number of segments to generate exceeded `math.MaxInt64`. [#63759][#63759]

<h3 id="v20-2-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Added a new setting to set the garbage collector intent age threshold: `kv.gc.intent_age_threshold`. [#62788][#62788]

<h3 id="v20-2-8-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Fixed duplicates of statements on the [**Transaction Details** page](../v20.2/ui-transactions-page.html) for multi-node clusters. [#62797][#62797]

<h3 id="v20-2-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- The `kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration` setting set to `0` will now disable routing requests to follower replicas. [#62441][#62441]
- Added support for usernames with special characters to [`cockroach userfile`](../v20.2/use-userfile-for-bulk-operations.html). [#60020][#60020]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur during planning for queries involving tables with many columns and at least one [GIN index](../v20.2/inverted-indexes.html). The error, `"estimated distinct count must be non-zero"`, was caused by an invalid pointer access in the cardinality estimation code. [#62561][#62561]
- Fixed an error where writing files to [`cockroach userfile`](../v20.2/use-userfile-for-bulk-operations.html) would sometimes result in an error claiming that the userfile table already existed. [#62547][#62547]
- Fixed a deficiency in the [replication layer](../v20.2/architecture/replication-layer.html) that could result in ranges becoming unavailable for prolonged periods of time (hours) when a write burst occurred under system overload. While unavailable, the range status page for the affected range would show a last index much larger than the committed index and no movement in these indexes on a quorum of the replicas. Note that this should be distinguished from the case in which enough replicas are offline to constitute a loss of quorum, where the replication layer can not make progress due to the loss of quorum itself. [#61848][#61848]
- Fixed a bug where tables that were created by CockroachDB v19.x or older that included [foreign key constraints](../v20.2/foreign-key.html) and were [backed up](../v20.2/backup.html) with the 'revision_history' option would be malformed when restored by a v20.x cluster if the call to [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) used the [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v20.2/as-of-system-time.html) option. [#62600][#62600]
- Fixed `"types cannot be matched for WITH RECURSIVE"` error in cases where we can cast the type in the initial expression. [#62825][#62825]
- Fixed an error where CockroachDB could encounter an internal error in rare circumstances when executing queries via the [vectorized engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) that operate on columns of [`BOOL`](../v20.2/bool.html), [`BYTES`](../v20.2/bytes.html), [`INT`](../v20.2/int.html), and [`FLOAT`](../v20.2/float.html) types that have a mix of _NULL_ and non-_NULL_ values. [#62916][#62916]
- Fixed a rare bug that could cause a node to consume excessive CPU and become unresponsive. [#62907][#62907]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur during planning when a query used the output of an [`UPDATE`](../v20.2/update.html)'s `RETURNING` clause, and one or more of the columns in the `RETURNING` clause were from a table specified in the `FROM` clause of the `UPDATE` (i.e., not from the table being updated). [#62961][#62961]
- Queries that reference tables with `GEOMETRY` or `GEOGRAPHY` [GIN indexes](../v20.2/spatial-indexes.html) and that call [geospatial functions](../v20.2/spatial-features.html) with constant `NULL` values cast to a type, like `NULL::GEOMETRY` or `NULL::FLOAT8`, no longer error. This bug was present since v20.2. [#63005][#63005]
- Dropping a [foreign key](../v20.2/foreign-key.html) that was added in the same transaction no longer triggers an internal error. This bug has been present since at least version v20.1. [#62880][#62880]
- Fixed a rare error `"unexpected type *tree.DOidWrapper for AsJSON"`. [#63232][#63232]
- Fixed a bug where index backfill data may have been missed by [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) in incremental backups. [#63265][#63265]
- Fixed a bug where lease acquisitions of descriptors in an offline state may starve out bulk operations such [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) or [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html). [#63229][#63229]
- Fixed a bug in [user-defined schemas](../v20.2/create-schema.html) whereby the dropping of any schema may prevent creation of schemas with the name of the database and may corrupt existing schemas of that name. [#63397][#63397]
- [Incremental cluster backups](../v20.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) may have missed data written to tables while they were `OFFLINE`. In practice, this could happen if [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) or [`IMPORT`](../v20.2/import.html) were running across incremental backups. This has now been fixed. [#63392][#63392]
- Fixed a rare issue that could cause replica divergence. These issues would be reported by the replica consistency checker, typically within 24 hours of occurrence, which would cause nodes to terminate. [#63474][#63474]
- CockroachDB now uses the existing primary key to validate indexes built for [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v20.2/alter-primary-key.html) changes. [#63585][#63585]
- Fixed an index out of range error that could occur when `crdb_internal_mvcc_timestamp` was selected as part of a [view](../v20.2/views.html). It is now possible to select `crdb_internal_mvcc_timestamp` as part of a view as long as it is aliased with a different name. [#63630][#63630]
- Error gracefully when attempting to run `ST_Segmentize` and generating more than `MaxInt64` points on a `GEOGRAPHY`. [#63759][#63759]
- Fixed a bug which could cause errors in [`DROP DATABASE CASCADE`](../v20.2/drop-database.html) when the database contained temporary views in other sessions which were not explicitly marked as `TEMPORARY`. [#63781][#63781]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur when executing queries using a [GIN index](../v20.2/inverted-indexes.html). The error was an index out of range error, and could occur in rare cases when a filter or join predicate contained at least two [`JSON`](../v20.2/jsonb.html), [`ARRAY`](../v20.2/array.html), `GEOMETRY` or `GEOGRAPHY` expressions that were combined with `AND`. [#63826][#63826]
- [`IMPORT`](../v20.2/import.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) jobs are now restored as reverting so that they clean up after themselves. Previously, some of the writes of the jobs while they were running may have been missed by [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html). [#63765][#63765]

<h3 id="v20-2-8-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved logic in determining the configuration for data to avoid expensive work when there are a large number of [user-defined schemas](../v20.2/create-schema.html). [#62356][#62356]
- Improved performance of reverting [`IMPORT INTO`](../v20.2/import-into.html) jobs that import into empty tables. [#63224][#63224]

<h3 id="v20-2-8-change-data-capture">Change Data Capture</h3>

- Kafka and [cloud storage sinks](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html#create-a-changefeed-connected-to-a-cloud-storage-sink) use a memory monitor to limit the amount of memory that can be used in internal buffers. [#63633][#63633]
- Connected the [changefeed](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) memory monitor to the parent SQL monitor to ensure that changefeeds do not try to use more memory than is available to the SQL server. [#63410][#63410]
- Made the Kafka library used in [changefeeds](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) configurable via the `kafka_sink_config` option to enable latency vs. throughput configuration. [#63362][#63362]
