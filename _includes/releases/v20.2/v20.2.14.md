## v20.2.14

Release Date: August 16, 2021

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v20-2-14-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The `cert-principal-map` flag passed to [`cockroach` commands](../v20.2/cockroach-commands.html) now allows the certificate principal name to contain colons. [#67811][#67811]
- The [node status retrieval endpoints over HTTP](../v20.2/monitoring-and-alerting.html) [`/_status/nodes`, `/_status/nodes/<N>` and the [DB Console](../v20.2/ui-overview.html) `/#/reports/nodes`) now require the [`admin` role](../v20.2/authorization.html) from the requesting user. This ensures that operational details such as network addresses and command-line flags do not leak to unprivileged users. This change means that the [Overview page](../v20.2/ui-overview.html) and [Hardware dashboard](../v20.2/ui-hardware-dashboard.html) of the DB Console will not show all details for non-`admin` users. [#67069][#67069]

<h3 id="v20-2-14-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- [Incremental backups](../v20.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) to a cloud storage location that already contains large existing backups now find their derived destination without listing as many remote files. [#67289][#67289]

<h3 id="v20-2-14-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Added a new [`EXPLAIN` flag](../v20.2/explain.html), `MEMO`, to be used with `EXPLAIN (OPT)`. When the `MEMO` flag is passed, a representation of the optimizer memo will be printed along with the best plan. The `MEMO` flag can be used in combination with other flags such as `CATALOG` and `VERBOSE`. For example, `EXPLAIN (OPT, MEMO, VERBOSE)` will print the memo along with verbose output for the best plan. [#67778][#67778]

<h3 id="v20-2-14-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The DB Console will now redirect the user to the originally requested page after user login. [#67859][#67859]

<h3 id="v20-2-14-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a statement buffer memory leak when using suspended portals. [#67370][#67370]
- Correlated subqueries that couldn't be decorrelated and that have their own subqueries are now executed correctly when supported. Note that this is a very rare edge case. [#67571][#67571]
- Fixed a very rare unexpected error from the [vectorized engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) ("index out of bounds") when evaluating the `CASE` operator. [#67785][#67785]
- Catching up [Raft](../v20.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#raft) followers on the Raft log is now more efficient in the presence of many large Raft log entries. This helps avoid situations where Raft leaders struggle to retain leadership while catching up their followers. [#67126][#67126]
- Fixed a rare bug when a lease change occurred during a range merge. This bug allowed [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](..//v20.2/as-of-system-time.html) queries to serve inconsistent results. [#65823][#65823]
- The [v20.2 SQL shell](../v20.2/cockroach-sql.html) now properly reports detailed execution timings (using the client-side configuration setting `verbose_times`) when run against a v21.1+ server. [#67853][#67853]
- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when many replicas were rapidly queued for removal. [#65861][#65861]
- Fixed two bugs which affected [geospatial queries](../v20.2/spatial-features.html) with the [`st_distance` function](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions). The first caused errors for filters of the form `st_distance(g1, g2, use_spheroid) = 0`. The second incorrectly transformed filters of the form `st_distance(g1, g2) = 0` when `g1` and `g2` are geographies to `st_instersects(g1, g2)`. This is not a valid transformation because `st_distance` makes spheroid-based calculations by default while `st_intersects` only makes sphere-based calculations. [#67412][#67412]
- Fixed an issue with statistics estimation in the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) that could have caused it to over-estimate the number of rows for some expressions and thus choose a sub-optimal plan. This issue could happen when multi-column statistics were used in combination with histograms, the query contained a predicate on two or more columns where the columns were highly correlated, and the selected values were very common according to the histograms. [#68012][#68012]
- Fixed an issue where CockroachDB could encounter an internal error or crash when performing a cast of a `NULL` [`JSON` value](../v20.2/jsonb.html) to [Geography or Geometry types](../v20.2/spatial-features.html). [#67903][#67903]
- [`INSERT`](../v20.2/insert.html) and [`UPDATE`](../v20.2/update.html) statements which operate on larger rows are now split into batches using the `sql.mutations.mutation_batch_byte_size` setting. [#67963][#67963]
- Fixed a rare bug that could result in a crash while creating a [`debug.zip`](../v20.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html). The bug would only occur if a `debug.zip` was captured during a period of rapid lease movement. [#67727][#67727]
- Fixed a rare crash when a [backup](../v20.2/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html) writing to Google Cloud Storage failed while writing a file. [#68258][#68258]
- Fixed missing foreign key checks in some cases when there are multiple checks and the inserted data contains a `NULL` for one of the checks. [#68521][#68521]
- Fixed a bug that prevented upreplication of an underreplicated range while in a joint quorum configuration. [#68576][#68576]

<h3 id="v20-2-14-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved the selectivity estimate for array containing predicates (for example, `arr @> ARRAY[1]`) in the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html). This improves the optimizer's cardinality estimation for queries containing these predicates, and may result in better query plans in some cases. [#67530][#67530]
- Updated the cost model in the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to make index joins more expensive and better reflect the reality of their cost. As a result, the optimizer will choose index joins less frequently, generally resulting in more efficient query plans. [#67530][#67530]
- Improved the performance of the [`pg_table_is_visible` built-in function](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html). [#68113][#68113]
