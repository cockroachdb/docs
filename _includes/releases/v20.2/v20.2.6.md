<h3 id="v20-2-6-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- `tar` is now included in the CockroachDB Dockerfile. This allows users to use `kubectl cp` on 20.2.x containers. [#61403][#61403] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-2-6-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Error messages for cross-database links now include a hint directing to the user to [the deprecation docs](v20.2.html#v20-2-0-deprecations). An example message looks like:  `ERROR: the view cannot refer to other databases; (see the 'sql.cross_db_views.enabled' cluster setting) SQLSTATE: 0A000 HINT: Note that cross database references will be removed in future releases. See: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v21.1.html#deprecations` [#60009][#60009] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- A new `parse_timestamp` [function](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html) can now be used to parse absolute timestamp strings in [computed column](../v20.2/computed-columns.html) expressions or [partial index](../v20.2/partial-indexes.html) predicates. [#60814][#60814] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Most batches of data flowing through the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) will now be limited in size by `sql.distsql.temp_storage.workmem` (64MiB by default) which should improve the stability of CockroachDB clusters. [#60571][#60571] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `ST_Buffer` [spatial function](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) now requires at least 1 quadrant segment. [#61360][#61360] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Prevented `densifyFracs` values of less than 1e-6 for `ST_FrechetDistance` and `ST_HausdorffDistance` [spatial functions](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#spatial-functions) to protect panics and out of memory errors. [#61434][#61434] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-2-6-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach` command](../v20.2/cockroach-commands.html) now supports the command-line parameter `--version` which reports its version parameters. This makes `cockroach --version` equivalent to [`cockroach version`](../v20.2/cockroach-version.html). [#59753][#59753] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [`cockroach version`](../v20.2/cockroach-version.html) command now supports a new parameter `--build-tag`. When `--build-tag` is specified, `cockroach version` displays the technical build tag, which makes it possible to integrate with automated deployment tools. [#59753][#59753] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-2-6-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- Manually enqueueing a range in the [GC queue](../v20.2/architecture/storage-layer.html#garbage-collection) now properly respects the `SkipShouldQueue` option. This can be useful to force the GC of a specific range. [#60745][#60745] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-2-6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Re-enabled some file-level performance optimizations such as WAL preallocation and read-ahead that got inadvertently disabled in a past change. [#59825][#59825]
- Previously if [`RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](../v20.2/savepoint.html) was followed by [`ROLLBACK`](../v20.2/rollback-transaction.html), the `sql.txn.rollback.count` metric would be incremented. This was incorrect, since the transaction had already committed. That metric is no longer incremented in this case. [#60250][#60250]
- Fixed a bug causing [backups](../v20.2/backup.html) to fail with an error when trying to read a backup that was written. [#59744][#59744]
- Fixed a bug in the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) statistics code that could cause an unconstrained [partial index](../v20.2/partial-indexes.html) scan to be preferred over a constrained scan of the same index. [#60517][#60517]
- Fixed a bug that caused errors for some queries on tables with [`GEOMETRY` or `GEOGRAPHY` GIN indexes](../v20.2/spatial-indexes.html) with filters containing shapes with zero area. [#60599][#60599]
- 20.2 introduced the ability to rebalance replicas between multiple stores on the same node. This change fixed a problem with that feature, where occasionally an intra-node rebalance would fail and a range would get stuck, permanently under-replicated. [#60633][#60633]
- Fixed an internal error caused in some cases involving JSON objects and arrays in a `VALUES` clause. [#60808][#60808]
- Previously, [retryable errors](../v20.2/transaction-retry-error-reference.html) in the cleanup phase of the type schema changer wouldn't be retried automatically in the background. This is now fixed. [#60817][#60817]
- Fixed a bug that could report that a protected timestamp limit was exceeded when the limit was disabled, if an error were to occur while protecting a record. [#60960][#60960]
- Previously, running [`DROP TYPE IF EXISTS`](../v20.2/drop-type.html) on one existent type and another non-existent type would cause an unhandled error. This is now fixed. [#60951][#60951]
- Fixed a bug whereby high-latency global clusters could sometimes fall behind checkpointing resolved timestamps. [#60925][#60925]
- CockroachDB previously didn't account for some RAM used when [disk-spilling operations](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html#disk-spilling-operations) (like sorts and hash joins) were using the temporary storage in the vectorized execution engine. This could result in out-of-memory crashes, especially when the rows are large in size. [#61016][#61016]
- Fixed execution errors for some queries that use set operations (`UNION` / `EXCEPT` / `INTERSECT`) where a column has types of different widths on the two sides (e.g., `INT4` vs `INT8`). [#61086][#61086]
- Unexpected internal errors containing stack traces that reference a `countingWriter` nil pointer have now been fixed. [#61072][#61072]
- Made lease transfers during rebalancing adhere to the rate limit utilized in other lease transfer cases, which eliminates unexpected lease oscillations when adding a new node. [#61038][#61038]
- Previously, comparing a negative [integer](../v20.2/int.html) to an OID would fail to compare correctly because the integer was not converted to an unsigned representation first. This is now fixed for both comparisons and casts. [#61166][#61166]
- The [`SHOW CREATE`](../v20.2/show-create.html) output of a [partitioned](../v20.2/partition-by.html) [partial index](../v20.2/partial-indexes.html) now lists the `PARTITION BY` and `WHERE` clauses in the order accepted by the parser. The `SHOW CREATE` output of a partial interleaved index also now lists the `INTERLEAVED` and `WHERE` clauses in the order accepted by the parser. [#61104][#61104]
- Fixed a bug causing [schema changes](../v20.2/online-schema-changes.html) on databases and schemas to panic in 20.2 if they failed or were cancelled and entered the reverting state. These jobs are not actually possible to revert. With this change, the correct error causing the job to fail is now returned, and the job now enters the failed state with an error indicating that the job could not be reverted. [#61160][#61160]
- The [`SHOW TABLES FROM database`](../v20.2/show-tables.html) command no longer shows a `NULL estimated_row_count` if inspecting a database that is not the current database. [#61200][#61200]
- Fixed a bug in `crdb_internal.unsafe_upsert_namespace_entry` related to tables and types in [user-defined schemas](../v20.2/create-schema.html). [#61260][#61260]
- Fixed a bug that prevented renaming a column that was referenced earlier in a transaction as part of a computed expression, index predicate, check expression, or not null constraint. [#61257][#61257]
- [Schema change jobs](../v20.2/online-schema-changes.html) associated with databases and schemas can no longer be canceled. Such jobs cannot actually be reverted successfully, so cancellation had no benefit and could have caused namespace corruption. [#61254][#61254]
- Fixed a bug with multi-store nodes where concurrent node startups could result in the re-use of store IDs. This could manifest in many different ways (e.g., replica thrashing due to the store ID collision). [#61262][#61262]
- Fixed a bug where [`DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`](../v20.2/drop-schema.html) could result in referenced types being dropped. [#61259][#61259]
- Fixed a bug whereby dropping a schema with a table that used a [user-defined type](../v20.2/create-type.html) which was not being dropped (because it is in a different schema) would result in a descriptor corruption due to a dangling back-reference to a dropped table on the type descriptor. [#61259][#61259]
- Fixed an internal error causing [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) statements on an [`INSERT`](../v20.2/insert.html) with an input that was determined by the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to produce no rows. [#61312][#61312]
- [`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`](../v20.2/alter-type.html) changes are now picked up by the [`ARRAY`](../v20.2/array.html) type alias correctly. [#61350][#61350]
- Creating [interleaved](../v20.2/interleave-in-parent.html) partitioned indexes is now disallowed. Previously, the database would crash when trying to create one. [#61422][#61422]
- A bug which caused [`UPSERT`](../v20.2/upsert.html) and [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`](../v20.2/insert.html) statements to fail on tables with both partial indexes and [foreign key references](../v20.2/foreign-key.html) has been fixed. This bug has been present since version 20.2.0. [#61489][#61489]
- An [`UPDATE ... FROM`](../v20.2/update.html) statement where the `FROM` clause contained column names that matched table column names previously returned an error if the table had a partial index predicate referencing those columns. This bug, present since partial indexes were released in version 20.2.0, has been fixed. [#61557][#61557]
- Fixed a bug causing an invalid tuple comparison using `ANY` to raise an internal error. In this case, CockroachDB now returns "unsupported comparison operator". [#61658][#61658]

<h3 id="v20-2-6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Enabled some file-level optimizations such as WAL preallocation and read-ahead when encryption-at-rest is used. [#59825][#59825]
- Improved the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html)'s cost estimation of [index](../v20.2/indexes.html) scans that must visit multiple [partitions](../v20.2/partition-by.html). When an index has multiple partitions, the optimizer is now more likely to choose a constrained scan rather than a full index scan. This can lead to better plans and improved performance. It also improves the ability of the database to serve queries if one of the partitions is unavailable. [#61069][#61069]
