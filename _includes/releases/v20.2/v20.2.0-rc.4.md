- A bug in earlier v20.2 versions caused some [`GRANT`](../v20.2/grant.html) and [`REVOKE`](../v20.2/revoke.html) commands on [user-defined schemas](../v20.2/create-schema.html) to incorrectly fail with an "invalid privileges" error. This affected schemas that were created after granting privileges at the database level. This bug is now resolved.
