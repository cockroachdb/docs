<h3 id="v20-2-0-beta-2-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- A new experimental flag `--accept-sql-without-tls` has been introduced for [`cockroach start`](../v20.2/cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach-start-single-node`](../v20.2/cockroach-start-single-node.html). When specified, a secure node will also accept secure SQL connections without TLS. When this flag is enabled:

  - Node-to-node connections still use TLS: the server must still be started with `--certs-dir` and valid [TLS cert configuration](../v20.2/authentication.html) for nodes.
  - Client [authentication](../v20.2/authentication.html) (spoof protection) and [authorization](../v20.2/authorization.html) (access control and privilege escalation prevention) are performed by CockroachDB as usual, subject to the HBA configuration (for authentication) and SQL privileges (for authorization).
  - Transport-level security (integrity and confidentiality) for client connections must then be provided by the operator outside of CockroachDB—for example, by using a private network or VPN dedicated to CockroachDB and its client app(s).
  - The flag only applies to the SQL interface. TLS is still required for the HTTP endpoint (unless `--unencrypted-localhost-http` is passed) and for the RPC endpoint.

		To introduce this feature into an existing cluster:

		<ol><li>Ensure the cluster ugprade is finalized.</li>
		<li>Set up the HBA configuration to reject `host` connections for any network other than the one that has been secured.</li>
		<li>Add the command-line flag and restart the nodes. Note that even when the flag is supplied, clients can still negotiate TLS and present a valid TLS certificate to identify themselves (at least under the default HBA configuration).</li></ol>
    Finally, this flag is experimental and its ergonomics will likely change in a later version. <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/54198">#54198</a>

<h3 id="v20-2-0-beta-2-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Previously, certain SQL commands sent over the PostgreSQL FE/BE protocol that were too big would error opaquely. This is now resolved for non-`PREPARE` related statements, clearly error messaging instead. [#54067][#54067]
- Databases being restored will now be in the offline state, invisible to users, until the data has been restored. This is the same as the existing behavior for restored tables. (This change is also applied to enums and user-defined schemas being restored, which is a change relative to only the v20.2 alpha releases.) [#54296][#54296]
- Implemented the `ST_SnapToGrid` [built-in](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#54054][#54054]

<h3 id="v20-2-0-beta-2-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- It is now possible to use password authentication over non-TLS connections with `cockroach` client CLI commands that use only SQL, e.g., [`cockroach sql`](../v20.2/cockroach-sql.html) or [`cockroach node ls`](../v20.2/cockroach-node.html). [#54198][#54198]

<h3 id="v20-2-0-beta-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a "no binding for WithID" internal error when using `WITH RECURSIVE` in queries with placeholders. [#54063][#54063]
- Fixed a bug whereby a crash during WAL rotation could cause CockroachDB to error on restart reporting corruption. [#54185][#54185]
- Previously, [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html)s that were cancelled could crash a node. This is now fixed. [#54289][#54289]
- Fixed two bugs when attempting to [add constraints](../v20.2/constraints.html#add-constraints) in the same transaction in which the table was created: Adding a `NOT NULL` constraint no longer fails with the error `check ... does not exist`, and adding a `NOT VALID` foreign key constraint no longer fails with the internal error `table descriptor is not valid: duplicate constraint name`. [#54287][#54287]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to out of memory errors when dropping large numbers of tables at high frequency. [#54286][#54286]
- Fixed a bug introduced in a v20.2 alpha release where incorrect caching could incur extra writes to the store during [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) on user-defined schemas. [#54296][#54296]

<h3 id="v20-2-0-beta-2-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- Added guidance on performing large deletes with [`DELETE`](../v20.2/delete.html). [#7999][#7999]
