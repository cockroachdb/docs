<h3 id="v20-2-5-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Added the ability to set region-specific callback URLs in the [OIDC config](../v20.2/sso.html). The `server.oidc_authentication.redirect_url` [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) can now accept JSON as an alternative to the basic URL string setting. If a JSON value is set, it *must* contain a `redirect_url` key that maps to an object with key-value pairs where the key is a `region` matching an existing locality setting, and the value is a callback URL. [#59651][#59651]

<h3 id="v20-2-5-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now runs fewer threads in parallel if running inside a container with a CPU limit. [#59184][#59184]
- Added ability to further debug connections shut down automatically by the server. [#59503][#59503]
- Renamed instances of "Admin UI" to "DB Console" in the documentation of [OIDC](../v20.2/sso.html) cluster settings. [#59651][#59651]

<h3 id="v20-2-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Introduced a cluster setting `sql.show_tables.estimated_row_count.enabled`, which defaults to `true`. If `sql.show_tables.estimated_row_count.enabled=false`, `estimated_row_count` will not display on [`SHOW TABLES`](../v20.2/show-tables.html) which improves performance. [#59776][#59776]

<h3 id="v20-2-5-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Previously, for certain log files, CockroachDB would both flush individual writes (i.e., propagate them from within the `cockroach` process to the OS) and synchronize writes (i.e., ask the OS to confirm the log data was written to disk). The per-write synchronization part was unnecessary and, in fact, found to be possibly detrimental to performance and operating cost, so it was removed. Meanwhile, the log data continues to be flushed as previously, and CockroachDB periodically (i.e., every 30s) requests synchronization as previously. [#58996][#58996]

<h3 id="v20-2-5-api-endpoint-changes">API endpoint changes</h3>

- The health API now checks that the SQL server is ready to accept clients when a readiness check is requested. [#59383][#59383]

<h3 id="v20-2-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- CockroachDB could previously return an internal error when evaluating a binary expression between a [`DECIMAL`](../v20.2/decimal.html) and an [`INTERVAL`](../v20.2/interval.html) that required a cast to a [`FLOAT`](../v20.2/float.html) when the value is out of range. Now a more user-friendly error is returned instead. [#58882][#58882]
- Fixed a bug that caused errors when accessing a tuple column (`tuple.column` syntax) of a tuple that could be statically determined to be null. [#58896][#58896]
- Fixed a nil pointer panic edge case in query setup code. [#59003][#59003]
- Garbage collection jobs now populate the `running_status` column for [`SHOW JOBS`](../v20.2/show-jobs.html). [#59137][#59137]
- Fixed a bug in which some non-conflicting rows provided as input to an [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`](../v20.2/insert.html) statement could be discarded, and not inserted. This could happen in cases where the table had one or more [unique indexes](../v20.2/unique.html) in addition to the [primary index](../v20.2/primary-key.html), and some of the rows in the input conflicted with existing values in one or more unique indexes. This scenario could cause the rows that did not conflict to be erroneously discarded. [#59169][#59169]
- Fixed a bug causing queries to hang when using large `max_decimal_digits` on [`ST_AsGeoJSON`](../v20.2/geojson.html). [#59167][#59167]
- Improved the accuracy of reported CPU usage when running in containers. [#59184][#59184]
- Fixed a nil pointer panic bug involving `catalog.FilterDescriptorState`. This bug affected all 20.2 versions since [v20.2.0](v20.2.html). [#58998][#58998]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to encounter an internal error when executing queries with [`BYTES`](../v20.2/bytes.html) or [`STRING`](../v20.2/string.html) types via the [vectorized engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) in rare circumstances. [#59151][#59151]
- Fixed a bug that initialized the GEOS library incorrectly, preventing multi-tenancy SQL pods from starting up correctly. [#59260][#59260]
- Fixed a bug in the URL handling of HTTP external storage paths on Windows [#59267][#59267]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to encounter an internal error when executing queries with tuples containing `NULL` values and [`ENUM`](../v20.2/enum.html)s in a distributed setting. [#59025][#59025]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to crash when executing [`ALTER INDEX ... SPLIT/UNSPLIT AT`](../v20.2/alter-index.html) statements when more values were provided than explicitly specified in the index. [#59271][#59271]
- Fixed a panic where type hints mismatching placeholder names caused a crash. [#59463][#59463]
- Previously, CockroachDB did not pass a pointer to the bound account associated with the index backfiller. This would lead to incorrect memory accounting. This bug has been fixed. [#59475][#59475]
- Previously, the `substring` [function](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html) on [`BYTES`](../v20.2/bytes.html) arrays would treat its input as unicode code points, which would cause the wrong bytes to be returned. Now it only operates on the raw bytes. [#59170][#59170]
- Previously, the `substring(byte[])` [functions](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html) were not able to interpret bytes that had the `\` character, as the functions were treating the character as the beginning of an escape sequence. This is now fixed. [#59170][#59170]
