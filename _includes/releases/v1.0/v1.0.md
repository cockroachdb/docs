<h3 id="v1-0-general-availability">General Availability</h3>

With this release, CockroachDB graduates from beta to a production-ready database built for the cloud and designed to power business at any scale from startup to enterprise. Years of development have gone into the capabilities included, from **distributed SQL** workloads with guaranteed ACID semantics, to **multi-active availability** with consistent consensus-based replication, to **simple and flexible deployment** and operations, to enterprise-scale **distributed, incremental backup and restore**.

Read more about these critical product areas in [this blog post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-1-0-release/), and then get started:

- Install CockroachDB using the download links above
- [Start a local cluster](../v1.0/demo-data-replication.html) and explore how CockroachDB automatically replicates and distributes data as you scale
- [Build an app](../v1.0/build-an-app-with-cockroachdb.html) on CockroachDB using a PostgreSQL-compatible driver or ORM
- Learn how to deploy a production cluster [manually](../v1.0/manual-deployment.html) or in the [cloud](../v1.0/cloud-deployment.html)
