### General Changes

- CockroachDB is now built with Go 1.7.1. [#9288](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9288)
- CockroachDB no longer requires Git 2.5; the minimum supported version is now 1.8. [#9325](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9325)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an inconsistency that could occur when two conflicting transactions were assigned the same timestamp. [#9100](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9100)
- Nodes with multiple stores now export metrics in a format that works with Prometheus. [#9322](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9322)

### Performance Improvements

- Improved concurrency of Raft processing so snapshots and replica garbage collection do not block other ranges. [#9176](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9176) [#9299](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9299)
- The rebalancing system is now more tolerant of small imbalances, making the range distribution more likely to reach a steady state. [#9230](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9230)
- Reduced memory used by debugging traces. [#9258](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9258)
- Ranges now become responsive sooner after startup. [#9276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9276)
- Removed an internal timeout that caused unnecessary retry loops. [#9234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9234)
- Try harder to ensure that the range lease and raft leadership are co-located. [#8834](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8834)
- Reduced memory used by Raft. [#9193](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9193)
- The consistency checker now uses less memory when an inconsistency is found. [#9159](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9159)
- The internal replica queues can now time out and recover from a replica that gets stuck. [#9312](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9312)
- Removed a redundant verification process that periodically scanned over all data. [#9333](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9333)

### Doc Updates

- Added docs for [deploying CockroachDB on AWS](../v1.0/deploy-cockroachdb-on-aws.html). [#640](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/640)
- Added a "back to top" feature to improve the usability of longer pages. [#638](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/638)
- Updated [Start a Local Cluster](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster.html) to suggest manually setting each node's cache size to avoid memory errors when testing against a local cluster in a serious way. [#652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/652)
- Updated docs on [transaction retries](../v1.0/transactions.html#transaction-retries) to provide the correct error code. [#647](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/647)
