<h3 id="beta-20161201-upgrade-notes">Upgrade Notes</h3>

Due to changes in the on-disk format of internal range leases, this release cannot be run concurrently with any prior release. All servers running older versions must be stopped before starting any node with this version. [#10420](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10420)

We realize that "stop the world" upgrades are overly interruptive and are actively working on infrastructure improvements to drastically reduce the need for such upgrades in the future.

<h3 id="beta-20161201-build-changes">Build Changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now *vendors* its dependencies, so building from source no longer interferes with other project in the `$GOPATH`. [#9900](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9900)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-sql-language-changes">SQL Language Changes</h3>

- Adding a [`FOREIGN KEY`](../v1.0/foreign-key.html) constraint now automatically creates necessary indexes. [#9572](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9572)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_roles`, `pg_catalog.pg_description`, `pg_catalog.pg_settings`, and `pg_catalog.pg_index` tables are now supported. [#10377](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10377) [#10381](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10381) [#10293](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10293) [#10548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10548) [#10592](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10592)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_depend` table is now partially supported (just enough to support `pgjdbc`). [#10696](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10696)
- `pg_catalog` tables now report databases as belonging to PostgreSQL-compatible namespaces. This is for compatibility only; CockroachDB does not have a notion of namespaces. [#11603](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11603)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_get_expr` and `pg_catalog.pg_generate_series` functions are now supported. [#10952](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10952) [#11214](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11214)
- The `conkey` and `confkey` columns of the `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` table now return real integer arrays. [#10584](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10584)
- New [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) `from_ip()` and `to_ip()` convert between binary and textual IP address formats. [#10349](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10349)
- Tuple types can now be returned by queries. [#10380](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10380)
- The SQL standard interval format `Y-M-D` is now supported. [#10499](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10499)
- The `array_length`, `array_upper`, and `array_lower` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are now available. [#10565](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10565)
- The `to_uuid` and `from_uuid` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are now available. [#10541](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10541)
- The `pow()` and `div()` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) now work when both arguments are integers. [#10538](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10538)
- The `ARRAY[]` constructor syntax is now supported. [#10585](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10585)
- The `COLLATE` operator is now supported. Collation support is still incomplete and will be improved in upcoming releases. [#10605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10605)
- The `current_schema` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) is now supported. [#10707](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10707)
- The `SET APPLICATION_NAME` statement is now supported. This is a write-only variable which is used by some frameworks but has no effect. [#10725](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10725)
- The [`CREATE DATABASE`](../v1.0/create-database.html) statement now accepts the options `TEMPLATE`, `LC_COLLATE`, and `LC_CTYPE` for compatibility with PostgreSQL, although the values available for these options are limited. [#10775](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10775)
- The [`SELECT`](../v1.0/select.html) statement now supports the `WITH ORDINALITY` modifier to generate row numbers. [#10558](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10558)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-command-line-interface-changes">Command-Line Interface Changes</h3>

- Temporary directories are no longer created automatically for logging. Commands other than `cockroach start` log to `stderr` if no `--log-dir` flag is given, and `cockroach start` writes to the directory of the first store. Various combinations of `--log-dir`, `--logtostderr`, and `--alsologtostderr` now work in more sensible ways. [#10675](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10675) [#10926](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10926) [#10962](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10962)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) prompt now indicates the status of the current transaction (if any). [#10866](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10866)
- The `--password` flag for the [`cockroach user set`](../v1.0/create-and-manage-users.html) command no longer accepts the new password as a command-line argument; instead this flag is a boolean to determine whether a password should be created for the user. The password is always read from `stdin`. [#10680](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10680)
- The [`cockroach user set`](../v1.0/create-and-manage-users.html) command no longer prompts for passwords in insecure mode unless `--password` is given. [#10547](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10547)
- The `cockroach debug compact` command now always rewrites all data, allowing it to pick up configuration changes. [#10532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10532)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI Changes</h3>

- The design of the Database tab has been updated. [#10552](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10552)
- Syntax highlighting is now used when displaying `CREATE TABLE` statements. [#10579](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10579)
- The UI no longer attempts to display information about the virtual databases `information_schema` and `pg_catalog`. [#10920](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10920)
- Metrics for the fraction of available and fully-replicated ranges are now computed more accurately. [#11213](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11213)

<h3 id="beta-20161201-performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>

- Replicating ranges to a new node is now more reliably performed back-to-back. [#10440](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10440) [#10749](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10749)

- Replica garbage collection is now triggered more reliably by replication changes. [#10500](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10500)

- Reduced memory allocations when encoding dates and times. [#10531](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10531)
- Parsing hexadecimal literals using the `x''` syntax is now more efficient. [#10660](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10660)
- Time series pruning is now more efficient. [#10682](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10682)
- Commands that have been canceled by clients no longer accumulate in the internal command queue. [#10772](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10772)
- When a command that has been retried on multiple replicas succeeds on any of them, any in-flight attempts on the other replicas is canceled. [#10970](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10970)
- The fast-path for local "RPCs" now uses goroutines to avoid blocking the caller. [#11196](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11196)
