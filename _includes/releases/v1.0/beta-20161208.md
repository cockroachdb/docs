### SQL Language Changes

- The `pg_catalog` and [`information_schema`](../v1.0/information-schema.html) databases now include information about the current database only, unless the user is `root`. [#11694](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11694)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_range` table is now supported. [#11725](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11725)
- The `pg_get_userbyid` function is now supported. [#12162](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12162)
- The [`SHOW TABLES`](../v1.0/show-tables.html), [`SHOW DATABASES`](../v1.0/show-databases.html), [`SHOW GRANTS`](../v1.0/show-grants.html) and [`SHOW COLUMNS`](../v1.0/show-columns.html) statements are now aliases for queries on the [`information_schema`](../v1.0/information-schema.html) database. [#10196](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10196)
- Empty passwords are no longer allowed in the [`CREATE USER WITH PASSWORD`](../v1.0/create-user.html) statement. [#11781](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11781)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- Log file names have changed. The new format is `cockroach.kenabook.kena.2016-11-28T20_00_35Z.009524.ERROR.log`. [#11666](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11666)

### Admin UI Changes

- On the **Cluster Overview** page, added a **Summary** section showing total nodes and capacity used, and updated the overall navigation and style. [#11696](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11696) [#11754](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11754)
- Several "allocator" metrics have been replaced with a new "underreplicated range" metric. [#11733](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11733) [#11983](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11983)
- The "ranges available" metric has been replaced with a "ranges unavailable" metric, which is computed differently. [#11760](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11760)
- New metrics have been added for the replication queue and replica GC queue. [#11753](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11753) [#11785](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11785)
- New metrics have been added for RPCs. [#11711](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11711)
- New metrics have been added to track commands that have been stuck for a long time. [#12106](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12106)

### Performance Improvements

- Range leases are now balanced across the nodes in a cluster. [#11757](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11757)
- Raft heartbeats are once again coalesced into one message per pair of nodes instead of per range. [#11757](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11757)
- Persisting the applied index is now faster. [#9993](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9993)
- The replication queue no longer tries to reprocess the same range repeatedly. [#11982](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11982)
- Limited frequent reprocessing of ranges for time series maintenance and consistency checks. [#10665](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10665)
- The time series maintenance queue no longer sends commands when it has nothing to do. [#11762](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11762)
- The `pow()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) is now faster when small numbers are raised to very large powers. [#11738](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11738)
- `JOIN` queries now only scan the columns they need. [#11736](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11736)
- Micro-optimized logging and removed some noisy log events. [#11778](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11778)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a panic when sending a raft message fails. [#11985](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11985)
- Fixed a memory spike that could occur during asymmetric partitions. [#12100](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12100)
- [`DROP DATABASE`](../v1.0/drop-database.html) now works when foreign key constraints are present. [#12036](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12036)
- [`DROP DATABASE`](../v1.0/drop-database.html) no longer hangs when subqueries have been used. [#11730](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11730)
- Requests no longer get stuck forever after a timeout. [#12000](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12000)
- Comparisons of SQL tuples now work for all types. [#10475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10475)
