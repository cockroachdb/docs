### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values are now truncated to microsecond resolution when sent over the network for compatibility with the PostgreSQL protocol. The `format_timestamp_ns(ts)` or `extract(nanosecond from ts)` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) can be used to access the full nanosecond precision of a timestamp. The `now()`, `current_timestamp()`, and `statement_timestamp()` functions are truncated to microsecond resolution to avoid confusion when timestamp values are used in unique indexes; the new `current_timestamp_ns()` function can be used to get a non-truncated timestamp. [#6604](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6604)

### New Features

- `DO NOTHING` is now supported in [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements. [#6633](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6633)
- [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints can now be specified at the table level. [#6625](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6625)
- Binary encoding is now supported in the network protocol for `BOOL`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, and `STRING` types, improving compatiblity with some PostgreSQL drivers. [#6661](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6661)
- The new `cockroach freeze-cluster` [command](../v1.0/cockroach-commands.html) has been added to the command-line interface; it will be used in the upgrade process for a future beta release. [#6675](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6675)

### Bug Fixes

- [`EXPLAIN DELETE`](../v1.0/explain.html) no longer executes the `DELETE` statement. [#6622](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6622)
- [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints are now enforced during [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements. [#6753](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6753)
- [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints now work correctly when columns have been dropped. [#6730](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6730)
- Tuples and the `DEFAULT` keyword now work in [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements. [#6636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6636)
- Errors are now reported with standard PostgreSQL error codes in more places. [#6652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6652), [#6554](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6554)
- Fixed a panic while a node is attempting a clean shutdown. [#6677](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6677)
- Internal retry logic has been improved so requests are no longer stuck retrying endlessly on the wrong replica. [#6688](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6688)

### Performance Improvements

- Snapshot generation is now throttled to reduce peak memory consumption.
  [#6632](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6632)
- Improved performance for transactions with low contention. [#6413](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6413)
- Improved performance for `UPSERT` statements (and the equivalent [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v1.0/insert.html) statements) when the table has no secondary indexes and values are supplied for all columns in the table. [#6673](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6673)

### Doc Updates

- [SQL Grammar](../v1.0/sql-grammar.html) diagrams have been streamlined to reduce unnecessary duplication.   
- Docs on SQL [Constraints](../v1.0/constraints.html) are now available. [#280](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/280)
- Docs on the [`CREATE TABLE`](../v1.0/create-table.html) statement are now available. [#296](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/296)
