- The `information_schema.statistics.NON_UNIQUE` field is now set correctly. [#12793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12793)
- It is now possible to use `EXPLAIN` statements as an input to other queries using a new square bracket syntax: `SELECT MAX(level) FROM [EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM kv ORDER BY v]`. [#12637](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12637)
