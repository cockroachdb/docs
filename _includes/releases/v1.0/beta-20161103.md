### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- Users (other than `root`) must now be created with the `CREATE USER` statement or `cockroach user set` command before they can be used for TLS certificate- or password-based authentication.  [#9794](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9794)
- The `ambiguous result` error message introduced in `beta-20161027` is now simply `result is ambiguous` since it may be returned outside of transactions. [#10279](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10279)

### SQL Language Changes

- Password-based authentication is now supported. Clients can authenticate with either a TLS certificate or a password. Documentation coming soon.[#9794](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9794)
- The `SHOW USERS` statement is now supported. [#10088](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10088)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_type`, `pg_catalog.pg_database`, `pg_catalog.pg_views`, `pg_catalog.pg_proc`, and `pg_catalog.pg_am` tables are now supported. [#10209](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10209), [#10284](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10284), [#10276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10276), [#10217](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10217), [#10363](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10363)
- The `information_schema.statistics` and `information_schema.views` tables are now supported. [#10220](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10220), [#10288](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10288)
- [`SHOW TABLES`](../v1.0/show-tables.html) now adds a `(dropped)` suffix to tables that are being dropped. [#10063](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10063)
- [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](../v1.0/show-create-view.html) now only requires permissions on the view, not the underlying tables. [#10270](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10270)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- When entering a transaction in the [built-in sql shell](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html), the statements are not sent to the server until there is either a `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, or two blank lines. This minimizes the lifetime of the transaction and therefore the risk of conflicts. [#10187](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10187)

### Performance Improvements

- Queries that span multiple ranges are now executed across those ranges in parallel. [#9197](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9197)
- Time series data (used in the admin UI) is now loaded in parallel. [#10250](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10250)
- Rebalancing now reaches an equilibrium faster. [#10330](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10330)

### Bug Fixes

- Memory usage of SQL queries is now monitored, and queries that use too much will fail rather than exhaust the server's memory. [#9259](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9259)
- Fixed a problem with snapshot error handling that could cause the cluster to be unable to make progress after node failure.
- Computing the `log()` of a very large number no longer causes the server to hang. [#10221](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10221)
- Decimal numbers are now parsed correctly in `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries. [#10242](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10242)
- `concat_ws()` with no arguments no longer crashes the server. [#10309](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10309)
- Fixed a bug when a command was executed after its client had disconnected. [#10279](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10279)

### Doc Updates

- Clarified and expanded the [`transactions`](../v1.0/transactions.html) overview documentation, and completed docs on transaction-specific statements: [#672](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/672)
    - [`BEGIN`](../v1.0/begin-transaction.html)
    - [`COMMIT`](../v1.0/commit-transaction.html)
    - [`SET TRANSACTION`](../v1.0/set-transaction.html)
    - [`SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](../v1.0/savepoint.html)
    - [`RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](../v1.0/release-savepoint.html)
    - [`ROLLBACK`](../v1.0/rollback-transaction.html)
    - [`SHOW`](../v1.0/show-vars.html)
- Added language-specific examples for [`INSERT` statements with `RETURNING`](../v1.0/insert.html#insert-and-return-values). [#813](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/813)
- Updated the [SQL Feature Support](../v1.0/sql-feature-support.html) page to reflect support for [views](../v1.0/views.html) (SQL standard) and [interleaved tables](../v1.0/interleave-in-parent.html) (CockroachDB extensions).
