### New Features

- The [`SERIAL`](../v1.0/serial.html) column type is now supported as an alias for `INT DEFAULT unique_rowid()`. In CockroachDB, this type defaults to a unique 64-bit signed integer that is the combination of the insert timestamp and the ID of the node executing the insert. It therefore differs from similar types in PostgreSQL and MySQL, which auto-increment integers in an approximate sequence. [#7032](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7032)
- For client-side [transaction retries](../v1.0/transactions.html#transaction-retries), reissuing the original `SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart` now has the same effect as `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`. This improves compatibility with some client drivers. [#6955](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6955)
- `FAMILY` is now a reserved word in the SQL dialect in preparation for a future feature. [#7069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7069)

### Bug Fixes

- The [command-line SQL shell](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) is now able to print non-ASCII characters. [#7045](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7045), [#7048](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7048)
- Commands issued with a timestamp outside the garbage collection window will now always fail. [#6992](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6992)
- All aggregate functions now return `NULL` when run on a table with no rows. [#7043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7043)

### Performance Improvements

- <a href="http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/" data-proofer-ignore><code>jemalloc</code></a> is now used as the memory allocator for the C++ portions of the server. The build tag `stdmalloc` can be used to switch back to the standard `malloc`. [#7006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7006)
- Raft logs are now garbage collected more aggressively. This should generally make snapshots smaller, reducing memory pressure, but sometimes it may cause more snapshots to be sent. [#7040](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7040)
- Reduced allocations in [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) and [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements involving secondary indexes. [#7011](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7011)
- Improved performance of conditional puts with no existing value. [#7016](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7016)
- Improved performance of small transactions. [#7015](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7015)

### Doc Updates

- The [Build an App](../v1.0/build-a-rust-app-with-cockroachdb.html) tutorial now demonstrates connecting to CockroachDB from the [Rust Postgres driver](../v1.0/install-client-drivers.html).
- Docs on the [`CREATE TABLE`](../v1.0/create-table.html) statement now offer both basic and expanded grammar diagrams. [#347](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/347)
- Docs on [constraints](../v1.0/constraints.html) now include diagrams of all table-level and row-level constraints. [#361](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/361)
