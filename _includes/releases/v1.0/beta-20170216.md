### SQL Language Changes

- The [search path](../v1.0/sql-name-resolution.html#search-path) for table names can now be set with `SET SEARCH_PATH`. [#13313](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13313)
- All built-in [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are now in the global namespace (instead of `pg_catalog`). [#13404](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13404)
- The `pg_extension` table and the `current_database` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are now supported. The `pg_type` and `pg_namespace` tables have had some changes to improve compatibility with ActiveRecord. [#13429](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13429)
- The columns used in foreign keys are now tracked more accurately. [#13439](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13439)

### Admin UI Changes

- The correct fonts are now used. [#13539](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13539)

### Bug Fixes

- Replicas that fall too far behind no longer get stuck in a state in which they can no longer catch up. [#13515](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13515)
- The `cockroach.LEVEL` symlinks created in the log directory now work. [#13585](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13585)

### Performance Improvements

- Reduced memory allocations in various places. [#13466](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13466) [#13487](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13487) [#13455](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13455) [#13579](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13579)
- The [minimum number of file descriptors](../v1.0/recommended-production-settings.html) has been reduced to 1956 (1700 per store + 256 for networking) so that CockroachDB can be run more easily on platforms with a default limit of 2048 file descriptors. [#13462](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13462)
- [`UPSERT`](../v1.0/upsert.html) is now faster in many cases. [#13488](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13488) [#13500](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13500)

### Doc Updates

- The [sample Kubernetes config](../v1.0/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) is now able to recover from a situation in which all nodes are down at once. [#13580](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13580)
- The [Build a Java App with CockroachDB](../v1.0/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html) tutorial now covers using the Hibernate ORM in addition to the jdbc driver. [#1100](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1100)
- The [Start a Cluster in Docker](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker.html) tutorial now offers OS-specific instructions, with specific improvements for running on Windows. [#1095](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1095)
