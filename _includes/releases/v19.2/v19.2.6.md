<h3 id="v19.2.6-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- [`cockroach init`](../v19.2/cockroach-init.html) now waits for server readiness and thus no longer fails when a mistaken server address is provided. [#46477][#46477]

<h3 id="v19.2.6-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- The non-authenticated `/health` HTTP endpoint was previously exposing the private IP address of the node, which can be privileged information in some deployments. This has been corrected. Deployments using automation to retrieve a node build details and address details should use `/_status/details/local` instead and use a valid admin authentication cookie. [#46477][#46477] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- All users can now *view* any comments on any object (bypassing other privileges), but modifying comments require write privilege on the target object. Previously, any user could modify any database/table/view/index comment via direct SQL updates to `system.comments`. This was unintended and a form of privilege escalation, and is now prevented. The privileges required for the [`COMMENT`](../v19.2/comment-on.html) statement, `pg_description`, `col_description()`, `obj_description()`, and `shobj_description()` are operating as in PostgreSQL and are unaffected by this change. [#46833][#46833] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19.2.6-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- The type checking code now prefers aggregate overloads with string inputs if there are multiple possible candidates due to arguments of unknown type. [#46807][#46807]
- Added an unimplemented error when attempting to `ADD CONSTRAINT` with the `EXCLUDE USING` syntax. [#46910][#46910]
- Added support for `CREATE INDEX .... INCLUDE (col1, col2, ...)`, which is an alias that PostgreSQL uses that is analogous to CockroachDB's `STORING (col1, col2, ...)` syntax. [#46910][#46910]
- Added support for parsing the `REINDEX` syntax, which results in an unimplemented error that explains that `REINDEX`ing is not required in CockroachDB. [#46910][#46910]
- `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` are now parsed but return errors. [#46805][#46805]
- Improved the error message for unsupported interactions between correlated subqueries and `WITH` clauses. [#46971][#46971]

<h3 id="v19.2.6-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- The [`cockroach init`](../v19.2/cockroach-init.html) command now waits until the node at the provided server address is ready to accept initialization. This also waits for network readiness. This makes it easier to implement initialization scripts by removing the need for a loop. In addition, implementing such a loop is operationally unsafe and is not recommended. [#46477][#46477]
- CockroachDB will now dump the stacks of all goroutines upon receiving `SIGQUIT` prior to terminating. This feature is intended for use while troubleshooting misbehaving nodes. [#46478][#46478]
- The [`cockroach start`](../v19.2/cockroach-start.html) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](../v20.1/cockroach-start-single-node.html) commands no longer initiate a 1-minute hard shutdown countdown after a request to gracefully terminate. This means that graceful shutdowns are now free to take longer than one minute. It also means that deployments where a maximum shutdown time must be enforced must now use a service manager that is suitably configured to do so. [#46483][#46483]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`](../v19.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html) command now creates valid zip files even if some of its requests encounter an error. [#46635][#46635]

<h3 id="v19.2.6-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI changes</h3>

- Metrics relating to SQL transaction restarts and rollbacks are now properly captured and exported. [#46272][#46272]
- The display options are now saved separately for each authenticated user. **Note:** When upgrading to a version with this change, all current display customizations for admin users are lost. [#46479][#46479]

<h3 id="v19.2.6-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where `pg_catalog.pg_indexes` showed the wrong index definition for inverted indexes. [#46564][#46564]
- Fixed a performance bug where `TRUNCATE` would take 2*num columns round trips. This could lead to slow truncate performance in distributed clusters. [#46648][#46648]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur in the optimizer when a `WHERE` filter contained at least one correlated subquery and one non-correlated subquery. [#46167][#46167]
- CockroachDB no longer returns an internal error in some cases when running queries with `CASE`, `AND`, or `OR` operators via the vectorized execution engine. [#46088][#46088]
- Fixed a bug where various session variables could not be set to the values "on" or "off", only true or false. [#46219][#46219]
- Accesses to `/health` using a non-root authentication token no longer hang when a node is currently under load, or if a system range is unavailable. [#46477][#46477]
- Fixed a race in the vectorized execution engine. [#46486][#46486]
- The `cockroach debug zip` command now properly collects heap profiles. [#46482][#46482]
- The goroutine dump facility now functions properly when logging to files is disabled, e.g., via `--log-dir=""` or `--logtostderr`. [#46482][#46482]
- Fixed a bug where the vectorized engine could sometimes give an incorrect result when reading from interleaved parents or children. [#46495][#46495]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur when an aggregate inside the right-hand side of a `LATERAL` join was scoped at the level of the left-hand side. [#46544][#46544]
- Fixed an error that incorrectly occurred when an aggregate was used inside the `WHERE` or `ON` clause of a [subquery](../v19.2/subqueries.html) but was scoped at an outer level of the query. [#46544][#46544]
- Added support for queries with qualified stars that refer to tables in outer scopes. [#46538][#46538]
- Fixed an incorrect "no data source matches prefix" error in some cases involving subqueries that use views. [#46537][#46537]
- Expressions of the form `NOT(a && b)` no longer fail. [#46539][#46539]
- Fixed a bug where operations on an index that contained a collated string in descending order would fail.[#46578][#46578]
- Fixed a bug where the vectorized engine would throw an internal error when executing a query that utilized an inverted index. [#46506][#46506]
- Fixed an internal error that could happen during planning when a column with a histogram was filtered with a predicate of a different data type. [#46667][#46667]
- CockroachDB no longer incorrectly accounts for some RAM usage when computing aggregate functions. [#46622][#46622]
- Fixed an incorrect query result that could occur when a scalar aggregate was called with a null input. [#46807][#46807]
- Benign "outbox next" errors are now only logged when log verbosity is set to 1 or greater. [#46837][#46837]
- Fixed incorrect result with count(*) when grouping on constant columns. [#46894][#46894]
- Customizations of the Admin UI are once again properly saved across sessions. [#46479][#46479]
- Fixed a rare bug causing transactions that have performed schema changes to deadlock after they restart. [#46904][#46904]

<h3 id="v19.2.6-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Less memory is loaded into memory for `crdb_internal.jobs`. [#46452][#46452]
- Virtual tables that access all table descriptors now make fewer round trips. [#46950][#46950]
