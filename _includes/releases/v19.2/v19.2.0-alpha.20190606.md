In addition to various enhancements and bug fixes, with this first alpha release of the v19.2.0 series, we would like to highlight the following changes:

- **Parallel Commit**: The parallel commit feature is a major optimization that halves the latency of distributed transactions, including those caused by secondary indexes. Previously, transactions would involve two synchronous rounds of replication consensus - one for write operations performed in parallel via [transaction pipelining](../v19.2/architecture/transaction-layer.html#transaction-pipelining) and then another for the commit. Now, replication for the commit runs in parallel with other write operations, avoiding an extra synchronous round trip and dramatically increasing overall transaction performance. This is achieved via a new "implicit" commit status that is distributed yet atomic and durable and that resolves to an "explicit" centralized status quickly for the efficiency of conflicting transactions. Detailed documentation is coming soon; in the meantime, see the [Parallel Commit RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20180324_parallel_commit.md).

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- Removed the deprecated `changefeed.min_high_water` metric; use `changefeed.max_behind_nanos` instead. [#36915][#36915]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Added the `kv.range_merge.manual_split_ttl` [cluster setting](../v19.2/cluster-settings.html). [#37728][#37728] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now uses the Business Source License instead of the Apache License. See our [blog post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/) for details. [#38007][#38007]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- You can now alter the zone configuration for a secondary index partition using the syntax `ALTER PARTITION OF INDEX <tablename>@<indexname> CONFIGURE ZONE ...`. [#36868][#36868] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Zigzag joins will now be planned by the optimizer in certain cases. They were previously available via the `experimental_enable_zigzag_join` session variable and can still be disabled by setting that value to `false`. [#35911][#35911] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `LATERAL` keyword in a `FROM` clause is now supported. [#36613][#36613] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `information_schema.columns` table now gives more conformant output for `varbit`, `char`, `timestamp`, and `time` types. [#36598][#36598] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Extended the list of advertised OIDs in `pg_type` to include additional array-related types, such as `_int2vector`, `_regproc`, etc. [#36598][#36598]
- CockroachDB now displays correct array type `oids` for `oidvector` and `int2vector` types in the `pg_type` table, for better PG compatibility. [#36598][#36598]

- Locale names in `COLLATE` clauses now have dash characters mapped to underscore when printed as part of SQL syntax. [#36598][#36598] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Parallel statement execution has been removed because the performance improvement it provided was absorbed by transactional pipelining, which doesn't require client buy in. The `RETURNING NOTHING` syntax will still be accepted but becomes a no-op. [#35959][#35959] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Only `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `UPSERT`, `DELETE`, `SHOW`, `EXPLAIN` are now supported as data sources using the `SELECT ...  FROM [ ... ]` syntax. [#36977][#36977] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `atttypmod` column of the `pg_attribute` catalog table is now supported. [#37230][#37230]
- Dates are now fully Postgres-compatible, including support for sentinel values (`+/- infinity`) and the Postgres date range (`4714-11-24 BC` to `5874897-12-31`). Existing dates outside of this range will be converted to the `+/- infinity` dates. [#36938][#36938] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added an overload for `now()` that returns a date. [#37284][#37284]
- Added supported for the empty `default_tablespace` session variable for Postgres compatibility. [#37333][#37333]
- Permitted casting empty arrays to any array type. [#37356][#37356]
- Removed the legacy batch-by-batch index backfiller, as well as the `schemachanger.bulk_index_backfill.enabled` [cluster setting](../v19.2/cluster-settings.html) that could be disabled to activate it. [#37213][#37213] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Removed the `transform` option from [`IMPORT`](../v19.2/import.html). [#37338][#37338] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added a new `locality_value` [built-in function](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html) that returns the value of the locality key given as its argument. [#37369][#37369] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now returns `NaN` instead of an error during invalid decimal operations. [#36964][#36964]
- Foreign keys that are added to an existing table using `ALTER TABLE` will now be validated for existing rows, with improved performance compared to running `ADD CONSTRAINT` followed by `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` previously. [#37433][#37433] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `SHOW COLUMNS ... WITH COMMENTS` now supports printing out column comments using the optional phrase `WITH COMMENT`, e.g `SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable WITH COMMENT`. [#37174][#37174] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `SHOW DATABASES WITH COMMENTS` now supports printing out database comments using the optional phrase `WITH COMMENT`, e.g `SHOW DATABASES WITH COMMENT`. [#37175][#37175] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `CREATE TABLE` statements now always trigger automatic statistics collection on a newly created table. [#37611][#37611] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `split_time` column to `crdb_internal.ranges` and `crdb_internal.ranges_no_leases`. [#37610][#37610]
- Corrected interval math when multiplying or dividing by floats or ints. [#37744][#37744]
- Added the `ALTER TABLE/INDEX ... UNSPLIT AT ...` statement. [#37603][#37603] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for the time value `24:00` and variants. [#37898][#37898]
- CockroachDB now reports a dedicated SQL error code in the particular situation where a multi-statement transaction is committed but one of the schema change (DDL) operations failed. As in previous versions, CockroachDB leaves the transaction partly committed and partly aborted in that case; the new error code aims to facilitate the recognition of this case in client code. [#37791][#37791] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for a `SHOW INDEXES FROM DATABASE` command. [#37942][#37942] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Included collected goroutine dumps in [`cockroach debug zip`](../v19.2/cockroach-debug-zip.html). [#36813][#36813] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `movr` workload to the `cockroach workload` command. This workload simulates a fictional ride sharing company and is based on our open-source [MovR GitHub repository](https://github.com/cockroachdb/movr). [#37709][#37709] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI changes</h3>

- CockroachDB now includes only successfully executed statements in the statement counters. [#37264][#37264]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a roundtrip typecasting issue where an `INET` casted to a `STRING` and back to an `INET` would fail. [#37938][#37938]
- Fixed a panic when `json_build_object` is called with `BIT`/`VARBIT` values. [#37057][#37057]
- Fixed a panic when planning zigzag joins against unique indexes. [#36139][#36139]
- `RESTORE` now balances the work of ingesting data more evenly between nodes. [#36665][#36665]
- `IMPORT` now balances the work of ingesting data more evenly between nodes. [#36665][#36665]
- CockroachDB now computes the result of shifting bit arrays to the right properly and avoids generating invalid bit arrays. [#36715][#36715]
- `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION` no longer emits invalid `ALTER` syntax in its output when displaying the zone configuration for a table or index partition that is inheriting from the database or the default configuration. [#36868][#36868]
- `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR TABLE t PARTITION p` no longer ignores the clause `PARTITION p` and now properly displays the zone configuration for that partition instead. [#36868][#36868] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- When a node is restarted with another node's address, CockroachDB now performs fewer attempts to communicate with the wrong node. [#34197][#34197]
- It is now possible to write to columns of type `name[]`. [#37170][#37170]
- Permitted planning of window functions within mutation statements (and others that cannot be distributed). [#37171][#37171]
- Avoided a source of internal connectivity problems that would resolve after restarting the affected node. [#37204][#37204]
- Permitted arrays and other sequences to be type-checkable in certain contexts when all of their elements are null. [#36673][#36673]
- CockroachDB now correctly escapes non-finite JSON number values when marshaling to text. [#37331][#37331]
- The [`cockroach init`](../v19.2/cockroach-init.html) command will now always properly report when a cluster is already initialized, even after the node that it's connecting to is restarted. [#37399][#37399] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Automated table statistics no longer encounter "batch timestamp must be after replica GC threshold" errors on configurations with low TTL. [#36500][#36500]
- Fixed type inference of columns in subqueries for some expressions of the form `scalar IN (subquery)`. [#37578][#37578]
- Fixed a crash in apply join. [#37597][#37597]
- The `age()` function is now correctly marked as impure, causing it to be unavailable in certain contexts. [#37609][#37609]
- Fixed a panic when constructing the error message for an invalid partitioning. [#37689][#37689]
- Fixed incorrect multiplication of `float` and `interval` types. [#37582][#37582]
- Fixed a case in which [`cockroach quit`](../v19.2/cockroach-quit.html) would return success even though the server process was still running in a severely degraded state. [#37668][#37668]
- Fixed a potential source of (faux) replica inconsistencies that can be reported while running a mixed v19.1 / v2.1 cluster. This error (in that situation only) is benign and can be resolved by upgrading to the latest v19.1 patch release. Every time this error occurs a "checkpoint" is created which will occupy a large amount of disk space and which needs to be removed manually (see `<store directory>/auxiliary/checkpoints`). [#37668][#37668]
- Prevented unlimited memory usage during SQL range deletions [#36728][#36728]
- Dividing floats by zero now returns an error instead of `-Inf`. [#37774][#37774]
- Fixed incorrect results or "incorrectly ordered stream" error in some cases of queries with aggregations. [#37713][#37713]
- A null right operand now causes the sub-operator expression to return null. [#37775][#37775]
- Certain binary encodings of numeric/decimal values no longer result in values that are an order of magnitude off. [#35115][#35115]
- Fixed `GROUP BY` for empty arrays. [#37901][#37901]
- Fixed a race condition that could cause a panic during query planning. [#37972][#37972]
- The `cockroach` command line utilities that internally use a RPC connection (e.g., `cockroach quit`, `cockroach init`, etc.) once again properly support passing an IPv6 address literal via the `--host` argument. [#37977][#37977]

<h3 id="v19-2-0-alpha-20190606-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Improved memory efficiency of bulk ingestion and index backfills buffering. [#36743][#36743]
