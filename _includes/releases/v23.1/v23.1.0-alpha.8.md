## v23.1.0-alpha.8

Release Date: March 27, 2023

{% include releases/release-downloads-docker-image.md release=include.release %}

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- Previously, users could gain unauthorized access to [statement diagnostic bundles](../v23.1/ui-statements-page.html#diagnostics) they did not create if they requested the bundle through an HTTP request to `/_admin/v1/stmtbundle/<id>` and correctly guessed its (non-secret) `ID`.  This change ensures that only authorized SQL users can request statement diagnostic bundles. [#99051][#99051]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Increased the specificity of log messages to help troubleshoot [DB Console SSO](../v23.1/sso-db-console.html) issues. [#98522][#98522]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-{{-site.data.products.enterprise-}}-edition-changes">{{ site.data.products.enterprise }} edition changes</h3>

- Enabled the `changefeed.mux_rangefeed.enabled` [cluster setting](../v23.1/cluster-settings.html) for MuxRangeFeed clients to increase the efficiency when running against large-scale workloads. [#97957][#97957]
- The `server.oidc_authentication.claim_json_key` [cluster setting](../v23.1/cluster-settings.html) for DB Console SSO now accepts list-valued token claims. [#98522][#98522]
- Added the `WITH` key_column option to override the message metadata key for [changefeeds](../v23.1/changefeed-examples.html). This changes the key hashed to determine Kafka partitions. It does not affect the output of `key_in_value` or the domain of the per-key ordering guarantee. [#98806][#98806]
- The [Node Map](../v23.1/ui-cluster-overview-page.html#node-map-enterprise) now shows normalized CPU usage. [#98225][#98225]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Fixed a bug where the check constraint on an `OID` type column results in a panic in the legacy schema changer. [#98800][#98800]
- Added a new `WITH REDACT` option to the following statements: [`SHOW CREATE`](../v23.1/show-create.html), [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](../v23.1/show-create.html#show-the-create-table-statement-for-a-table), and [`SHOW CREATE VIEW`](../v23.1/show-create.html#show-the-create-view-statement-for-a-view)  which replaces constants and literals in the printed `CREATE` statement with the redacted marker, `‹×›`. [#98251][#98251]
- Added support for the `REDACT` flag to the following variants of [`EXPLAIN`](../v23.1/explain.html): `EXPLAIN (OPT)`, `EXPLAIN (OPT, CATALOG)`, `EXPLAIN (OPT, MEMO)`, `EXPLAIN (OPT, TYPES)`, and `EXPLAIN (OPT, VERBOSE)`.  These `EXPLAIN` statements will have constants, literal values, parameter values, and any other user data redacted in the output. [#97549][#97549]
- Disallowed the [`RESTORE`](../v23.1/restore.html) of backups taken on a cluster version older than the minimum binary version the current cluster can interoperate with. This is described in an updated version of the policy outlined in ["Restoring Backups Across Versions"](../v23.1/restoring-backups-across-versions.html). [#98597][#98597]
- Bulk [`COPY FROM`](../v23.1/copy-from.html) statements are now processed with a vectorized insert and can be anywhere from 0.5x to 5x faster. Typical hardware and schemas should see a 2x improvement. Vectorized inserts are only used for `COPY` statements and are not yet applied to regular inserts. Both the `vectorize` and `copy_fast_path_enabled` session variables can be used to disable this feature. [#98605][#98605]
- Added the setting `sql.pgwire.multiple_active_portals.enabled`. This setting is only for a `PREVIEWABLE` feature. With it set to `true`, all non-internal portals with read-only [`SELECT`](../v23.1/selection-queries.html) queries without sub/post queries can be paused and resumed in an interleaving manner, but are executed with a local plan. [#99052][#99052]
- Added [stemming and stopword-eliminating](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/full-text-indexing-search/) text search configurations for English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. [#97677][#97677]
- Added the `system.statement_activity` and `system.transaction_activity` tables. These tables are used to populate the [SQL Activity](../v23.1/ui-statements-page.html) pages, and contain the top N statements and transactions based on different key columns. [#99179][#99179]
- Added helper text for [`UPDATE`](../v23.1/update.html) to include `FROM <source>`. [#99301][#99301]
- Added the `default_text_search_config` variable for compatibility with single-argument variants to the following text search functions: `to_tsvector`, `to_tsquery`, `phraseto_tsquery`, and `plainto_tsquery`, which use the value of `default_text_search_config` instead of expecting one to be included as in the two-argument variants. The default value of this setting is `english`. [#99323][#99323]
- Added the `ts_rank` function for ranking text search query results. [#99323][#99323]
- Renamed the `coordinator_locality` option in [`BACKUP`](../v23.1/backup.html) to `execution locality`. [#99176][#99176]
- The nodes involved in the execution of [backups](../v23.1/take-full-and-incremental-backups.html), including processing of row data and job coordination, can now be controlled using an execution-locality filter. [#99176][#99176]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

- Checkpoint directories that can be created in the rare event of range inconsistency are now clearly indicated as `pending` until they are fully populated. This helps operators  distinguish valid checkpoints from corrupted ones. [#99119][#99119]
- [Prometheus](../v23.1/monitor-cockroachdb-with-prometheus.html) metrics available at the `_status/vars` path now contain a `node_id` label that identifies the node they were scraped from. [#99235][#99235]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-db-console-changes">DB Console changes</h3>

- The [Statement & Transaction Fingerprints](../v23.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprint-page) pages no longer poll data, to simplify the user experience and reduce any performance impact. [#98331][#98331]
- Data on the [Statement Fingerprint Details](../v23.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprints-view) page no longer updates automatically every 5mins. [#99298][#99298]
- Updated the Jobs table column name from "Last Modified Time" to "Last Execution Time". [#99021][#99021]
- On the [SQL Activity Fingerprints](../v23.1/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) pages, users will not see stats that have not yet been flushed to disk. [#98815][#98815]
- Users can now request `top-k statements by % runtime` on the SQL Activity Fingerprints pages. [#98815][#98815]
- Added Search Criteria to the [Statements](../v23.1/ui-statements-page.html) and [Transactions](../v23.1/ui-transactions-page.html) pages, and updated the UX with improvements. [#98815][#98815]
- Added badges for each selected filter on the [SQL Activity](../v23.1/ui-overview.html#sql-activity) and [Insights](../v23.1/ui-insights-page.html) pages. [#98988][#98988]
- The default request sort for the [Statement Fingerprints Overview](../v23.1/ui-statements-page.html#statement-fingerprints-view) page is now `% of All Runtime`. [#99298][#99298]
- Fixed a bug where the table's `CREATE` statement would not display correctly on the [Table Details](../v23.1/ui-databases-page.html#table-details) page. [#99434][#99434]
- Added an assertion on the KV side to prevent other existing or future attempts of LeafTxn issuing locking requests. This ensures the KV API is used as agreed upon and can be helpful in debugging latency issues caused by holding locks. [#99412][#99412] 

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a rare panic in `upstream etcd-io/raft` when a message appends race with log compaction. [#98721][#98721]
- In the DB Console Stats pages, issuing a new request for stats while one is pending is now allowed and will replace the pending request. [#98331][#98331]
- Fixed a bug in which [`SET avoid_buffering = true`](../v23.1/set-vars.html) could produce a crash on subsequent operations. [#98290][#98290]
- Fixed a bug where using [`ST_Transform`](../v23.1/functions-and-operators.html#st_transform) could result in a memory leak. [#98740][#98740]
- Fixed internal errors in [`SHOW JOBS`](../v23.1/show-jobs.html) statements that have a `WITH` clause. [#98389][#98389]
- Previously, the [`ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT cluster_logical_timestamp()`](../v23.1/alter-table.html#add-column) statement would crash the node and leave the table in a corrupt state. The root cause is a `nil` pointer dereference. The bug is now fixed by returning an unimplemented error and hence disallowing using the [builtin function](../v23.1/functions-and-operators.html#array-functions) as the default value when backfilling. [#98696][#98696]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a cached query with a user-defined type reference from being invalidated even after a schema change that should prevent the type from being resolved. [#96045][#96045]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent a cached query from being invalidated when a [UDF](../v23.1/user-defined-functions.html) referenced by that query was altered or dropped. [#96045][#96045]
- Fixed the replacement of in-flight requests for `KeyedCachedDataReducer`s to prevent permanent loading on requests stuck on an `inFlight` status. [#99095][#99095]
- Improved the reliability of latency data in v23.1 clusters. [#99294][#99294]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The Raft tick interval has been increased from `200ms` to `500ms` in order to reduce per-replica CPU costs, and can now be adjusted via `COCKROACH_RAFT_TICK_INTERVAL`. Dependant parameters such as the Raft election timeout (`COCKROACH_RAFT_ELECTION_TIMEOUT_TICKS`), reproposal timeout (`COCKROACH_RAFT_REPROPOSAL_TIMEOUT_TICKS`), and heartbeat interval (`COCKROACH_RAFT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_TICKS`) have been adjusted such that their wall-time value remains the same. [#98584][#98584]
- The Raft scheduler is now sharded to relieve contention during range Raft processing, which can significantly improve performance at high CPU core counts. [#98854][#98854]

<h3 id="v23-1-0-alpha-8-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Running `./dev ui test` (or `bazel test //pkg/ui/workspaces/db-console:jest`) now uses less memory. [#98880][#98880]
