CockroachDB introduced a critical bug in the [v20.1.4 release](../releases/v20.1.html#v20-1-4) that affects [`UPSERT`](../v20.1/upsert.html) and [`INSERT â€¦ ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET x = excluded.x`](../v20.1/insert.html#on-conflict-clause) statements involving more than 10,000 rows. All deployments running CockroachDB v20.1.4 and v20.1.5 are affected. A fix is included in [v20.1.6](../releases/v20.1.html#v20-1-6).

<h3 id="v20-1-5-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Reduced memory used by table scans containing JSON data. [#53318][#53318]

<h3 id="v20-1-5-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed an internal error that could occur when an [aggregate function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) argument contained [a correlated subquery](../v20.1/subqueries.html#correlated-subqueries) with another aggregate function referencing the outer scope. This now returns an appropriate user-friendly error, "aggregate function calls cannot be nested". [#52142][#52142]
- Previously, subtracting months from a [`TIMESTAMP`](../v20.1/timestamp.html)/[`DATE`](../v20.1/date.html)/[`TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v20.1/timestamp.html) whose date value is greater than 28 could subtract an additional year. This bug is now fixed. [#52156][#52156]
- Previously, CockroachDB could return incorrect results on queries that encountered `ReadWithinUncertaintyInterval` errors. This bug is now fixed. [#52045][#52045]
- Fixed instances of slow plans for prepared queries involving [CTEs](../v20.1/common-table-expressions.html) or foreign key checks. [#52205][#52205]
- Large write requests no longer have a chance of erroneously throwing a "transaction with sequence has a different value" error. [#52267][#52267]
- Type OIDs in the result metadata were incorrect for the `bit`, `bpchar`, `char(n)`, and `varchar(n)` types, and the corresponding array types. They are now correct. [#52351][#52351]
- CockroachDB now prevents deadlocks on connection close with an open user transaction and [temporary tables](../v20.1/temporary-tables.html). [#52326][#52326]
- Fixed a bug that could prevent schema changes for up to 5 minutes when using the `COPY` protocol. [#52455][#52455]
- Executing a large number of statements in a transaction without committing could previously crash a CockroachDB server. This bug is now fixed. [#52402][#52402]
- Fixed a bug causing the temporary object cleaner to get stuck trying to remove objects that it mistakenly thought were temporary. Note that no persistent data was deleted. The temporary cleaner simply returned an error because it thought certain persistent data was temporary. [#52662][#52662]
- Previously, CockroachDB would erroneously restart the execution of empty, unclosed portals after they had been fully exhausted. This bug is now fixed. [#52443][#52443]
- Fixed a bug causing the Google Cloud API client used by [`BACKUP`](../v20.1/backup.html), [`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html) and [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html) to leak memory when interacting with Google Cloud Storage. [#53229][#53229]
- CockroachDB no longer displays a value for `gc.ttlseconds` if not set. [#52813][#52813]

<h3 id="v20-1-5-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Queries no longer block during planning if cached table statistics have become stale and the new statistics have not yet been loaded. Instead, the stale statistics are used for planning until the new statistics have been loaded. This improves performance because it prevents latency spikes that may occur if there is a delay in loading the new statistics. [#52191][#52191]
