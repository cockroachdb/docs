<h3 id="v20.1.16-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Fixed a correctness bug which caused [partitioned](../v20.1/partitioning.html) index scans to omit rows where the value of the first index column was `NULL`. This bug was present since v19.2.0. [#64050][#64050]
- Fixed a bug where multiple concurrent invocations of [`cockroach debug zip`](../v20.1/cockroach-debug-zip.html) could lead to cluster instability. This bug was present since CockroachDB v20.1. [#64086][#64086]
- Previously, passwords in SQL statements in telemetry updates and crash reports were anonymized as `*****`. Passwords are now anonymized as `'*****'` so that the SQL statements do not result in parsing errors when executed. [#64347][#64347]
- Fixed a race condition where read-only requests during replica removal (e.g., during range merges or rebalancing) could be evaluated on the removed replica, returning an empty result. [#64377][#64377]
- Fixed a bug where [encryption-at-rest](../v20.1/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise) metadata was not synced and might become corrupted during a hard reset. [#64498][#64498]

<h3 id="v20.1.16-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- The Raft processing goroutine pool's size is now capped at 96. This was observed to prevent instability on large machines (32+ vCPU) in clusters with many ranges (50k+ per node). [#64568][#64568]
- The Raft scheduler now prioritizes the node liveness Range. This was observed to prevent instability on large machines (32+ vCPU) in clusters with many ranges (50k+ per node). [#64568][#64568]
