<h3 id="v20-1-2-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Corrected the replicas count for table details in the Admin UI. [#49206][#49206]
- The `rolcanlogin` value for roles is now correctly populated in `pg_roles` and `pg_catalog`. [#49622][#49622]
- Fixed a rare bug in the Pebble storage engine that could lead to storage engine inconsistencies. [#49378][#49378]
- Corrected how engine type is reported in bug reports when using [`cockroach demo`](../v20.1/cockroach-demo.html). [#49377][#49377]
- Fixed a bug where [`cockroach quit`](../v20.1/cockroach-quit.html) would not proceed to perform a hard shutdown when the value passed to `--drain-wait` was very small, but non-zero. This bug existed since v19.1.9, v19.2.7 and v20.1.1. [#49363][#49363]
- Fixed a bug where [`demo node restart`](../v20.1/cockroach-demo.html) would not work due to an invalid certificate directory. [#49390][#49390]
- Fixed some benign errors that were being reported as unexpected internal errors by the vectorized execution engine. [#49534][#49534]
- Fixed a rare bug in the Pebble storage engine where keys were being returned out-of-order from large sstable files. [#49602][#49602]
- When run via the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.1/vectorized-execution.html), queries with a hash routed in the DistSQL plan no longer return an internal error or incorrect results. [#49624][#49624]
- When run via the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.1/vectorized-execution.html), queries that have columns of the [`BYTES`](../v20.1/bytes.html) type in the output no longer result in an internal error. [#49384][#49384]
- CockroachDB no longer leaks file descriptors during [GSS authentication](../v20.1/gssapi_authentication.html). [#49614][#49614]
- Attempting to perform a full cluster [`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html) on a backup that did not contain any user data no longer fails. [#49745][#49745]
- Abandoned intents due to failed transaction coordinators are now cleaned up much faster. This resolves a regression in v20.1.0 compared to prior releases. [#49835][#49835]
- Fixed the descriptions for `--socket-dir` and `--socket` in the CLI help. They were incorrect since v20.1.0. [#49906][#49906]
- Adjusted Pebble's out of memory error behavior to match that of the Go runtime in order to make the condition more obvious. [#49874][#49874]
- When performing incremental backups with revision history on a database (or full cluster), and a table in the database was dropped and then other tables were later created, the backup no longer returns an error. [#49925][#49925]
- Fixed an internal planning error for recursive CTEs (`WITH RECURSIVE` expressions) in which the left side of the `UNION ALL` query used in the CTE definition produced zero rows. [#49964][#49964]

<h3 id="v20-1-2-doc-updates">Doc updates</h3>

- Added a [CockroachCloud Quickstart](../cockroachcloud/quickstart.html) on creating and connecting to a 30-day free CockroachCloud cluster and running your first query. [#7454][#7454]
- Updated the [Active Record tutorial](../v20.1/build-a-ruby-app-with-cockroachdb-activerecord.html) to use a new CockroachDB adapter version. [#7480][#7480]
- Changed instances of "whitelist"/"blacklist" to "allowlist"/"blocklist" throughout the documentation. [#7479][#7479]
- Updated all mentions of `range_min_size` and `range_max_size` to use the new default values of `134217728` and `536870912`, respectively. [#7449][#7449]
- Updated the [hardware storage recommendations](../v20.1/recommended-production-settings.html#storage). [#7514][#7514]
- Revised the node [decommissioning guidance](../v20.1/remove-nodes.html). [#7304][#7304]
