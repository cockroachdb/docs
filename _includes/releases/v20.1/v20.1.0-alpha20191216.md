<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-security-updates">Security updates</h3>

- CockroachDB previously allowed non-authenticated access to privileged HTTP endpoints like `/_admin/v1/events`, which operate using `root` user permissions and can thus access (and sometimes modify) any and all data in the cluster. This security vulnerability has been patched by disallowing non-authenticated access to these endpoints and restricting access to admin users only.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Users who have built monitoring automation using these HTTP endpoints must modify their automation to work using an HTTP session token for an admin user.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Some Admin UI screens (e.g., Jobs) were previously incorrectly displayed using `root` user permissions, regardless of the logged-in user's credentials. This enabled insufficiently privileged users to access privileged information. This security vulnerability has been patched by using the credentials of the logged-in user to display all Admin UI screens.

- Privileged HTTP endpoints and certain Admin UI screens require an admin user. However, `root` is disallowed from logging in via HTTP and it is not possible to create additional admin accounts without an Enterprise license. This is further discussed [here](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/43870) and will be addressed in an upcoming patch revision.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Users without an Enterprise license can create an additional admin user using a temporary evaluation license, until an alternative is available. A user created this way will persist beyond the license expiry.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Some Admin UI screens currently display an error or a blank page when viewed by a non-admin user (e.g., Table Details). This is a known limitation mistakenly introduced by the changes described above. This situation is discussed further [here](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/44033) and will be addressed in an upcoming patch revision. The list of UI pages affected includes but is not limited to:

  - Job details
  - Database details
  - Table details
  - Zone configurations

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Users can access these Admin UI screens using an admin user until a fix is available.

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-backward-incompatible-changes">Backward-incompatible changes</h3>

- The combination of the [`CHANGEFEED`](../v20.1/change-data-capture.html) options `format=experimental_avro`, `envelope=key_only`, and `updated` is now rejected. This is because the use of `key_only` prevents any rows with updated fields from being emitted, which renders the `updated` option meaningless. [#41793][#41793] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-general-changes">General changes</h3>

- Client usernames can now be defined to start with a digit; in particular, all-digit usernames are now permitted. [#42464][#42464] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Changed the default value of the `--max-sql-memory` limit from 128mb to 25% of system memory. [#42480][#42480] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Nodes that have been terminated as the result of a failed consistency check now refuse to restart, making it more likely that the operator notices that there is a persistent issue in a timely manner. [#42401][#42401]
- CockroachDB will now advertise some previously-hidden cluster settings, such as `enterprise.license`, in reports such as the one generated by [`SHOW ALL CLUSTER SETTINGS`](../v20.1/show-cluster-setting.html). Only the names are listed; the values are still redacted out. The values can be accessed/modified using the specific statements `SET`/[`SHOW CLUSTER SETTING`](../v20.1/show-cluster-setting.html) (singular). [#42520][#42520] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is now possible to easily identify cluster settings for which tuning effects are known and documented, via the new column `public` in the output of [`SHOW ALL CLUSTER SETTINGS`](../v20.1/show-cluster-setting.html) and the virtual table `crdb_internal.cluster_settings`. [#42520][#42520] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-enterprise-edition-changes">Enterprise edition changes</h3>

- [`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html) now supports the restoration of empty databases. [#42005][#42005] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-sql-language-changes">SQL language changes</h3>

- Filters of the form `x = D` (as in `SELECT * FROM t WHERE x = D AND f(x)`), where `D` is a constant and `x` is a column name, will now cause `D` to be inlined for `x` in other filters. [#42151][#42151] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The ID of the current session is now available via a `session_id` variable. Session IDs are also now shown in [`SHOW QUERIES`](../v20.1/show-queries.html) results. [#41622][#41622] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [`extract()` function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html) now returns values of type float and includes fractional parts in the values for element 'second', 'millisecond', 'julian', and 'epoch'. This improves compatibility with PostgreSQL's `extract()` which returns values of type double precision. [#42131][#42131] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `pg_index.indoption` now correctly conveys ascending/descending order and nulls the first/last positioning of columns in an index. [#42343][#42343] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Updated pgwire to send `ParameterStatus` messages when certain server parameters are changed for the given session over pgwire. [#42376][#42376]
- Added the ability to run the `avg()` function over intervals. [#42457][#42457] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is now supported to specify selection target aliases as `GROUP BY` columns. Note that the `FROM` columns take precedence over the aliases, which are only used if there are no columns with those names in the current scope. [#42447][#42447] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Updated the error message hint when a client attempts to add a sequence-based column to an existing table (which is an unimplemented feature) to refer to Github issue [#42508](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/42508). [#42509][#42509]
- CockroachDB now returns a more accurate error message, hint, and error code when an error is encountered while adding a new column. [#42509][#42509]
- `EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)` now indicates if auto-commit will be used for mutations. [#42500][#42500] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Mutations in CTEs not at the top level are no longer allowed. This restriction is also implemented by Postgres. [#41033][#41033] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `WITH` expressions are now hoisted to the top level in a query when possible. [#41033][#41033]
- Made the [`date_trunc` function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html) follow Postgres more closely by truncating to Monday when used with `week`.  Previously, it truncated to Sunday. [#42622][#42622] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Introduce precision support for [`TIMESTAMP` and `TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v20.1/timestamp.html), supporting precisions from 0 to 6 inclusive. Previous versions of `TIMESTAMP` and `TIMESTAMPTZ` defaulted to 6 units of precision. Note that if you downgrade while having a precision set, you will have full precision (6) again, but if you re-upgrade you will find your precisions truncated again. [#42580][#42580] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`CREATE/ALTER SEQUENCE`](../v20.1/alter-sequence.html) now support the `OWNED BY` syntax. [#40992][#40992] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Changed [`extract()`](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html) on a `TIMESTAMPTZ` to match the environment's location in which `extract()` is executed. Previously, it would always perform the operation as if it was in UTC. Furthermore, `timezone`, `timezone_hour` and `timezone_minute` are added to the `extract()` command. [#42632][#42632] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`CHANGEFEED`](../v20.1/change-data-capture.html) now supports a `WITH diff` option, which instructs it to include a `before` field in each publication. [#41793][#41793] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The fields in the Avro format for [`CHANGEFEED`](../v20.1/change-data-capture.html) records have been re-ordered to allow for optimized parsing. This is a backwards compatible change. [#41793][#41793] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Users can now use the [`current_timestamp()` function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html) with a given precision from 0-6, e.g., `SELECT current_timestamp(4)`. [#42633][#42633] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- When executed via the [vectorized engine](../v20.1/vectorized-execution.html), make each buffering operator use at most `sql.distsql.temp_storage.workmem` memory (which is 64MB by default).  Previously, all buffering operators (like hash and merge joins, sorts) could use arbitrary amounts of memory which could lead to OOM panics. [#42468][#42468] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added a new statement `SHOW PUBLIC CLUSTER SETTINGS` (abbreviated as `SHOW CLUSTER SETTINGS`), which can be used to list only the public cluster settings that are supported for tuning and configuration. [#42520][#42520] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `kv.allocator.min_lease_transfer_interval` cluster setting, which allows the minimum interval between lease transfers initiated from each node to be configured. [#42724][#42724] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Made string to interval conversion more strict. For example, strings such as `'&#123;&#123;'` and `'{1,2}'` were previously interpreted as the 00:00 interval. They are now rejected. [#42739][#42739]
- Some columns in `pg_type` (`typinput`, `typoutput`, `typreceive`, `typsend`, `typmodin`, `typmodout`, `typanalyze`) were incorrectly typed as `OID` instead of `REGPROC`.  This issue has been resolved. [#42782][#42782]
- Users can now use the `cast()` function to cast strings to `int[]` or `decimal[]`, when appropriate. [#42704][#42704] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `SET TIME ZONE` now accepts inputs beginning with `GMT` and `UTC`, such as `GMT+5` and `UTC-3:59`. This was previously unsupported. [#42781][#42781] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is now possible to reference tables by table descriptor ID in mutations using `INSERT`/`UPSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, in a similar way to what is already allowed in `SELECT` statements. For example: `INSERT INTO [53 AS foo] VALUES (1, 2, 3)`. [#42683][#42683] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added new support for precision for `TIME` types (e.g., `TIME(3)` will truncate to milliseconds). Previously this would raise syntax errors. [#42668][#42668] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-command-line-changes">Command-line changes</h3>

- Users can now use `cockroach demo` to shut down and restart nodes. This is available in `cockroach demo` only as `demo <decommission|recommission|shutdown|restart> <node_num>`. This command is not available in other CLIs, e.g., `cockroach sql`. **This feature is experimental**. [#42230][#42230] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The various CLI commands that use SQL now display errors using a new display format that emphasizes the 5-digit [`SQLSTATE`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLSTATE) code. Users are encouraged to combine these codes together with the error message when seeking help or troubleshooting. [#42779][#42779] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-admin-ui-changes">Admin UI changes</h3>

- Fixed typo that breaks [statements page](../v20.1/admin-ui-statements-page.html) loading. [#42577][#42577]
- Certain web UI pages (like the list of databases or tables) now restrict their content to match the privileges of the logged-in user. [#42563][#42563] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The event log now presents all cluster settings changes, unredacted, when an admin user uses the page. [#42563][#42563] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Customization of the UI by users is now only properly saved if the user has write privilege to `system.ui` (i.e., is an admin user). Also, all authenticated users share the same customizations. This is a known limitation and should be lifted in a future version. [#42563][#42563] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Access to table statistics are temporarily blocked from access by non-admin users until further notice, for security reasons. [#42563][#42563] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Certain debug pages have been blocked from non-admin users for security reasons. [#42563][#42563] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The cluster settings page now lists public and reserved settings in two separate tables. [#42520][#42520] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added a new range selector that supports custom time/date ranges. [#41327][#41327] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

- Reduced the likelihood of out-of-memory errors during histogram collection. [#42357][#42357]
- Fixed a bug which could result in ranges becoming unavailable while a single node is unreachable. The symptoms of this would closely resemble that of a range that has lost a majority of replicas, i.e., the log files would likely include messages of the form "have been waiting [...] for proposing command", except that a majority will be available, though not reflected in the surviving replicas' range status. [#42251][#42251]
- Fixed a Makefile bug that would prevent building CockroachDB from sources in rare circumstances. [#42363][#42363]
- Fixed an out-of-memory error that could occur when collecting statistics on tables with a string index column. [#42372][#42372]
- Changed the return type of (date +- interval) and (interval + date) to be timestamp instead of timestamptz, to be in line with Postgres. Furthermore, this change fixed a bug where these calculations would be incorrect if the current timezone is not UTC. [#42324][#42324]
- Fixed a bug when using `experimental_save_rejected` for CSV [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html) that would cause the rejected row file to overwrite the original input file. [#42398][#42398]
- For tables with dropped indexes, the [`SHOW RANGE FOR ROW`](../v20.1/show-range-for-row.html) command sometimes returned incorrect results or an error. Fixed the underlying issue in the `crdb_internal.encode_key` built-in function. [#42456][#42456]
- Fixed a bug in scenarios where we have `UPDATE` cascades, and we are updating a table that has `CHECK` constraints, and the table is self-referencing or is involved in a reference cycle. In this case an `UPDATE` that cascades back in the original table was not validated with respect to the `CHECK` constraints. [#42231][#42231]
- The [movr workload](../v20.1/movr.html) now populates table columns with randomly generated data instead of nulls. [#42483][#42483]
- Fixed a bug where if a sequence is used by two columns of the same table, the dependency relation with the first column can be lost. [#40900][#40900]
- Fixed a bug where memory was leaking when counting rows during backup. [#42529][#42529]
- Fixed a bug where, if one were to cast the same type into two or more different precisions/widths from a table in the same `SELECT` query, they would only get the first precision specified. For example, `SELECT a::decimal(10, 3), a::decimal(10, 1) FROM t` would return both results as `a::decimal(10, 3)`. [#42574][#42574]
- CockroachDB will now be less likely hang in an inconvenient/inoperative state if it attempts to access an external HTTP server that blocks or is overloaded. A possible symptom of the bug is a node failing to shut down upon `cockroach quit`. This bug is present since at least version 2.0. [#42536][#42536]
- Stopped including tables that are being restored or imported as valid targets in backups and changefeeds. [#42606][#42606]
- Fixed a bug that would produce a spurious failure with the error message "incompatible `COALESCE` expressions" when adding or validating `MATCH FULL` foreign key constraints involving composite keys with columns of differing types. [#42528][#42528]
- When a custom `nullif` is provided during `IMPORT`, always treat it as a null value. [#42635][#42635]
- Changefeeds now emit backfill row updates for a dropped column when the table descriptor drops that column. [#42053][#42053]
- It's now possible to transfer range leases to lagging replicas. [#42379][#42379]
- Long running transactions which attempt to `TRUNCATE` can now be pushed and will commit in cases where they previously could fail or retry forever. [#42650][#42650]
- Fixed multiple existing bugs: a panic on performing cascade updates on tables with  multiple column families; a bug where a self referential foreign key constraint with a `SET DEFAULT` would not be maintained on a cascading update; a bug where multiple self-referential foreign key constraints would cause all the rows in the referenced constraint columns to be set to _NULL_ or a default value on a cascading update. [#42624][#42624]
- Fixed a case where we incorrectly determined that a query (or part of a query) which contains an `IS NULL` constraint on a unique index column returns at most one row, possibly ignoring a `LIMIT 1` clause. [#42760][#42760]
- Fixed a bug with incorrect handling of top _K_ sort by the vectorized engine when _K_ is greater than 1024. [#42831][#42831]
- `ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS` no longer fails when using an unqualified index name that does not match any existing index. Now it is a no-op. [#42797][#42797]
- Prevent internal error in some cases when a _NULL_ literal is passed to the `OVERLAPS` operator. [#42877][#42877]
- CockroachDB now prevents a number of panics from the SQL layer caused by an invalid range split. These would usually manifest with messages mentioning encoding errors (including "found null on not null column", but also possibly various others). [#42833][#42833]
- The result column names for the JSON functions `json{b}_array_elements`, `json{b}_array_elements_text`, `json{b}_each`, `json{b}_each_text` were fixed to be compatible with Postgres. [#41861][#41861]
- Fixed a bug where selecting columns by forcing an `INTERLEAVING` index would error instead of returning the correct results. [#42798][#42798]
- Fixed a bug where attempting to parse `0000-01-01 00:00` when involving `time` did not work, as `pgdate` does not understand `0000` as a year. [#42762][#42762]

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3>

- Transactions are now able to refresh their read timestamp even after the partial success of a batch. [#35140][#35140]
- Some retryable errors are now avoided by declining to restart transactions on some false conflicts. [#42236][#42236]
- CockroachDB now detects the case when the right-hand side of an `ANY` expression is a _NULL_ array (and determine that the expression is always false). [#42698][#42698]
- CockroachDB now generates better plans in many cases where the query has `LEFT` / `RIGHT JOIN`s and also has a `LIMIT`. [#42718][#42718]

<h3 id="v20-1-0-alpha20191216-build-changes">Build changes</h3>

- Go version 1.12.10+ is now required to build CockroachDB successfully. [#42474][#42474] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `make buildshort` is now able to produce valid CCL binaries with all enterprise features (minus UI). [#42541][#42541] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
