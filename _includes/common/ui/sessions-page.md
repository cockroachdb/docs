## Sessions table

Use the **Sessions** table to see active, idle, and closed sessions. A session is *active* if it has an open transaction (including implicit transactions, which are individual SQL statements), and *idle* if it has no open transaction. Active sessions consume hardware resources. A session is *closed* if it has closed the connection to CockroachDB.
