While the `cockroach debug` command has a few subcommands, users are expected to use only the [`zip`](debug-zip.html), [`encryption-active-key`](debug-encryption-active-key.html),  [`merge-logs`](debug-merge-logs.html), and [`ballast`](debug-ballast.html) subcommands.

The other `debug` subcommands are useful only to CockroachDB's developers and contributors.
