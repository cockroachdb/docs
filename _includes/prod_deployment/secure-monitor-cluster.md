View your cluster's Admin UI by going to `https://<address of any node>:8080`. Note that your browser will consider the CockroachDB-created certificate invalid; youâ€™ll need to click through a warning message to get to the UI.

In the UI, verify that the cluster is running as expected:

1. Click **View nodes list** on the right to ensure that all of your nodes successfully joined the cluster.

2. Click the **Databases** tab on the left to verify that `securenodetest` is listed.
