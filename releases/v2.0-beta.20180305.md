### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- [Sequences](../v2.0/create-sequence.html) are now supported in enterprise [`BACKUP`](../v2.0/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v2.0/restore.html) jobs.

    This changes how sequences are stored in the key-value storage layer, so existing sequences must be dropped and recreated. Since a sequence cannot be dropped while it is being used in a column's [`DEFAULT`](../v2.0/default-value.html) expression, those expressions must be dropped before the sequence is dropped, and recreated after the sequence is recreated. The `setval()` function can be used to set the value of a sequence to what it was previously. [#21684][#21684]

- Positive [constraints in replication zone configs](../v2.0/configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) no longer work. Any existing positive constraints will be ignored. This change should not impact existing deployments since positive constraints have not been documented or supported for some time. [#22906][#22906]

### Build Changes

- CockroachDB now builds with go 1.9.4 and higher. [#22608][#22608]

### General Changes

- [Diagnostics reports](../v2.0/diagnostics-reporting.html) now include information about changed settings and statistics on types of errors encountered during SQL execution. [#22705][#22705], [#22693][#22693], [#22948][#22948]

### Enterprise Edition Changes

- Revision history [`BACKUP`](../v2.0/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v2.0/restore.html) is no longer considered experimental. [#22679][#22679]
- Revision history [`BACKUP`](../v2.0/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v2.0/restore.html) now handles schema changes. [#21717][#21717]
- CockroachDB now checks that a backup actually contains the requested restore time. [#22659][#22659]
- Improved [`BACKUP`](../v2.0/backup.html)'s handling of tables after [`TRUNCATE`](../v2.0/truncate.html). [#21895][#21895]
- Ensured that only the backups created by the same cluster can be used in incremental backups. [#22474][#22474]
- Avoided extra internal copying of files during [`RESTORE`](../v2.0/restore.html). [#22281][#22281]
- Added a geographical map to the homepage of the Admin UI enterprise version, showing the location of nodes and localities in the cluster. The map is annotated with several top-level metrics: storage capacity used, queries per second, and current CPU usage, as well as the liveness status of nodes in the cluster. [#22763][#22763]

### SQL Language Changes

- The type determined for constant `NULL` expressions is renamed to `unknown` for better compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#23150][#23150]
- Deleting multiple rows at once now consumes less memory. [#23013][#23013]
- Attempts to modify virtual schemas with DDL statements now fail with a clearer error message. [#23041][#23041]
- The new `SHOW SCHEMAS` statement reveals which are the valid virtual schemas next to the physical schema `public`. [#23041][#23041]
- CockroachDB now recognizes the special syntax `SET SCHEMA <name>` as an alias for `SET search_path = <name>` for better compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#23041][#23041]
- `current_role()` and `current_catalog()` are supported as aliases for the `current_user()` and `current_database()` [built-in functions](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html) for better compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#23041][#23041]
- CockroachDB now returns the correct error code for division by zero. [#22948][#22948]
- The GC of table data after a [`DROP TABLE`](../v2.0/drop-table.html) statement now respects changes to the GC TTL interval specified in the zone config [#22903][#22903]
- The full names of tables/view/sequences are now properly logged in the system event log. [#22848][#22848]
- CockroachDB now recognizes the syntax `db.public.tbl` in addition to `db.tbl` for better compatibility with PostgreSQL. The handling of the session variable `search_path`, as well as that of the built-in functions `current_schemas()` and `current_schema()`, is now closer to that of PostgreSQL. Thus `SHOW TABLES FROM` can now inspect the tables of a specific schema (for example, `SHOW TABLES FROM db.public` or `SHOW TABLES FROM db.pg_catalog`). `SHOW GRANTS` also shows the schema of the databases and tables. [#22753][#22753]
- Users can now configure auditing per table and per access mode with `ALTER TABLE`. [#22534][#22534]
- SQL execution logs enabled by the [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) `sql.trace.log_statement_execute` now go to a separate log file. This is an experimental feature meant to aid troubleshooting CockroachDB. [#22534][#22534]
- Added the `string_to_array()` [built-in function](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html). [#22391][#22391]
- Added the `constraint_column_usage` table and roles-related tables to the [`information_schema`](../v2.0/information-schema.html) database. [#22323][#22323] [#22242][#22242]
- [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) no longer requires the experimental setting. [#22531][#22531]
- Computed columns and `CHECK` constraints now correctly report column names in the case of a type error. [#22500][#22500]
- The output of [`JSON`](../v2.0/jsonb.html) data now matches that of PostgreSQL. [#22393][#22393]
- Allowed [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) jobs to be paused. `IMPORT` jobs now correctly resume instead of being abandoned if the coordinator goes down. [#22291][#22291]
- Removed the `into_db` option in [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html). The database is now specified as part of the table name. [#21813][#21813]
- Changed computed column syntax and improved related error messages. [#22429][#22429]
- Implemented additional [`INET`](../v2.0/inet.html) column type operators such as `contains` and `contained by`, binary operations, and addition/subtraction.
- Implemented the following operators for [`INET`](../v2.0/inet.html) column types: `<<`, `<<=`, `>>`, `>>=`, `&&`, `+`, `-`, `^`, `|`, `&`.  These operators are compatible with PostgreSQL 10 and are described in Table: 9.36 of the PostgreSQL documentation. [#21437][#21437]
- CockroachDB now properly rejects incorrectly-cased SQL function names with an error. [#22365][#22365]
- Allowed [`DEFAULT`](../v2.0/default-value.html) expressions in the `CREATE TABLE` of an [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) CSV. The expressions are not evaluated (data in the CSV is still required to be present). This change only allows them to be part of the table definition. [#22307][#22307]
- Added the `#-` [operator](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html) for `JSON`. [#22375][#22375]
- The `SET transaction_isolation` statement is now supported for better PostgreSQL compatibility. [#22389][#22389]
- Allowed creation of computed columns. [#21823][#21823]
- Avoided extra internal copying of files during [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html). [#22281][#22281]
- Casts between [array types](../v2.0/array.html) are now allowed when a cast between the parameter types is allowed. [#22338][#22338]
- Scalar functions can now be used in `FROM` clauses. [#22314][#22314]
- Added privilege checks on [sequences](../v2.0/create-sequence.html). [#22284][#22284]
- The `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`, `ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and `ON UPDATE SET NULL` [foreign key constraint actions](../v2.0/foreign-key.html#foreign-key-actions-new-in-v2-0) are now fully supported. [#22220][#22220] [#21767][#21767] [#21716][#21716]
- The `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` [foreign key constraint actions](../v2.0/foreign-key.html#foreign-key-actions-new-in-v2-0) can now also contain `CHECK` constraints. [#22535][#22535]
- JSON inverted indexes can now be specified in a [`CREATE TABLE`](../v2.0/create-table.html) statement. [#22217][#22217]
- When a node is gracefully shut down, planning queries are avoided and distributed queries are allowed the amount of time specified by the new `server.drain_max_wait` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) before the node is drained and stopped. [#20450][#20450]
- [Collated string](../v2.0/collate.html) are now supported in [IMPORT](../v2.0/import.html) jobs. [#21859][#21859]
- The new `SHOW GRANTS ON ROLE` statement and `pg_catalog.pg_auth_members` table lists role memberships. [#22205][#22205] [#21780][#21780]
- Role memberships are now considered in permission checks. [#21820][#21820]

### Command-Line Changes

- [Replication zone constraints](../v2.0/configure-replication-zones.html#replication-constraints) can now be specified on a per-replica basis, meaning you can configure some replicas in a zone's ranges to follow one set of constraints and other replicas to follow other constraints. [#22906][#22906]
- Per-replica constraints no longer have to add up to the total number of replicas in a range. If you do not specify all the replicas, then the remaining replicas will be allowed on any store. [#23081][#23081]
- [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now reminds the user about `SET database = ...` and `CREATE DATABASE` if started with no current database set. [#23089][#23089]
- Error messages displayed while connecting to a server with an incompatible version have been improved. [#22709][#22709]
- The `--cache` and `--max-sql-memory` flags of [`cockroach start`](../v2.0/start-a-node.html) now also support decimal notation to support a fraction of total available RAM size, e.g., `--cache=.25` is equivalent to `--cache=25%`. This simplifies integration with system management tools. [#22460][#22460]
- When printing tabular results as CSV or TSV, no final row count is emitted. This is intended to increase interoperability with external tools. [#20835][#20835]
- The `pretty` formatter does not introduce special unicode characters in multi-line table cells, for better compatibility with certain clients. To disambiguate multi-line cells from multiple single-line cells, a user can use `WITH ORDINALITY` to add a row numbering column. [#22324][#22324]
- Allowed specification of arbitrary RocksDB options. [#22401][#22401]
- [Debug commands](../v2.0/debug-zip.html) now open RocksDB in read-only mode. This makes them faster and able to run in parallel. [#21778][#21778]
- The [`cockroach dump`](../v2.0/sql-dump.html) command now outputs `CREATE SEQUENCE` statements before the `CREATE TABLE` statements that use them. [#21774][#21774]
- For better compatibility with `psql`'s extended format, the table formatter `records` now properly indicates line continuations in multi-line rows. [#22325][#22325]
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) client-side option `show_times` is now always enabled when output goes to a terminal, not just when `display_format` is set to `pretty`. [#22326][#22326]
- When formatting [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) results with `--format=sql`, the row count is now printed in a SQL comment at the end. [#22327][#22327]
- When formatting [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) results with `--format=csv` or `--format=tsv`, result rows that contain special characters are now quoted properly. [#19306][#19306]

### Admin UI Changes

- [Decommissioned nodes](../v2.0/remove-nodes.html) are no longer included in cluster stats aggregates. [#22711][#22711]
- Time series metrics dashboards now show their own title rather than the generic "Cluster Overview". [#22746][#22746]
- The URLs for Admin UI pages have been reorganized to provide more consistent structure to the site. Old links will redirect to the new location of the page. [#22746][#22746]
- Nodes being decommissioned are now included in the total nodes count until they are completely decommissioned. [#22690][#22690]
- Added new graphs for monitoring activity of the time series system. [#22672][#22672]
- Disk usage for time series data is now visible on the **Databases** page. [#22398][#22398]
- Added a ui-clean task. [#22552][#22552]
- Added an icon to indicate when descriptions in the **Jobs** table are shortened and expandable. [#22221][#22221]
- Added "compaction queue" graphs to the **Queues** dashboard. [#22218][#22218]
- Added Raft snapshot queue metrics to the **Queue** dashboard. [#22210][#22210]
- Dead nodes are now displayed before live nodes on the **Nodes List** page. [#22222][#22222]
- Links to documentation in the Admin UI now point to the docs for v2.0. [#21894][#21894]

- The `pg_typeof()` function now returns the correct type for the output of `UNION ALL` even when the left sub-select has a `NULL` column. [#22438][#22438]
- `<TYPE> <value>` literal casts now work correctly for all fixed-length types. [#22397][#22397]
- Errors from DDL statements sent by a client as part of a transaction, but in a different query string than the final commit, are no longer silently swallowed. [#21829][#21829]

### Performance Improvements

- Improved a cluster's ability to continue operating when nearly out of disk space on most nodes. [#21866][#21866]
- Disk space is more aggressively freed up when the disk is almost full. [#22235][#22235]
- Experimentally enabled some joins to perform a lookup join and increase join speed for cases where the right side of the join is much larger than the left. [#22674][#22674]
- Supported distributed execution of `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` queries. [#22442][#22442]
- Reduced cancellation time of DistSQL aggregation queries. [#22684][#22684]
- Unnecessary value checksums are no longer computed, speeding up database writes. [#22487][#22487]
- Reduced unnecessary logging in the storage layer. [#22516][#22516]
- Improved the performance of distributed sql queries. [#22471][#22471]
- Distributed execution of `INTERSECT ALL` and `EXCEPT ALL` queries is now supported. [#21896][#21896]
- Allowed `-` in usernames, but not as the first character. [#22728][#22728]
- A `COMMIT` reporting an error generated by a previous parallel statement (i.e., `RETURNING NOTHING`) no longer leaves the connection in an aborted transaction state. Instead, the transaction is considered completed and a `ROLLBACK` is not necessary. [#22683][#22683]
- Significantly reduced the likelihood of serializable restarts seen by clients due to concurrent workloads. [#21140][#21140]
- Reduced disruption from nodes recovering from network partitions. [#22316][#22316]
- Improved the performance of scans by copying less data in memory. [#22309][#22309]
- Slightly improved the performance of low-level scan operations. [#22244][#22244]
- When a range grows too large, writes are now be backpressured until the range is successfully able to split. This prevents unbounded range growth and improves a clusters ability to stay healthy under hotspot workloads. [#21777][#21777]
- The `information_schema` and `pg_catalog` databases are now faster to query. [#21609][#21609]
- Reduced the write amplification of Raft replication. [#20647][#20647]
