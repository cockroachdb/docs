### Enterprise edition changes

- Avro_schema_prefix flag sets Schema.namespace [#66091][#66091]
- `kafka_sink_config` now supports a `version` configuration item to specify Kafka server versions. This is likely only necessary for old (Kafka 0.11/Confluent 3.3 or early) Kafka servers. Further, unspecified items in `kafka_sink_config` now retain their default values. [#66316][#66316]
- CHANGEFEEDs with custom kafka client configurations (via the kafka_sink_config) that could lead to potentially long delays in flushing messages will now produce an error. [#66316][#66316]

### SQL language changes

- Prevent intra-query leak during disk spilling that could cause the database to run out of memory, especially during disk spilling operations on tables with wide rows. [#66170][#66170]
- Creating STORED computed columns with expressions that reference foreign key columns is now allowed. [#66169][#66169]
- Added "WITH full_table_name" option to create a changefeed on "movr.public.drivers" instead of "drivers". [#66091][#66091]
- Added WITH avro_schema_prefix option to avro changefeeds to prevent collisions in a shared schema registry [#66091][#66091]

### Operational changes

- BACKUP now puts backup data files in a "data" sub-directory of the BACKUP path instead of directly in the backup path. [#66164][#66164]

### DB Console changes

- Style fix of password input field for Safari [#66135][#66135]

### Bug fixes

- Queries now use up to 1MB less actual system memory per scan, lookup join, index join, zigzag join, or inverted join in their query plans. This will result in improved memory performance for workloads with concurrent OLAP-style queries. [#66170][#66170]
- Envelope schema in avro registry now honors schema_prefix and full_table_name [#66091][#66091]
- Backups no longer risk the possibility of blocking conflicting writes while being rate limited by the kv.bulk_io_write.concurrent_export_requests concurrency limit. [#66409][#66409]
- Operations like BACKUP can now reuse a previously created S3 client session when operating on the same bucket, which can avoid NoCredentialProviders errors on EC2 when interating with large incremental backups. [#66260][#66260]
- Fix a crash when performing a cluster BACKUP with revision history of a cluster upgraded from 20.1 to 20.2 to 21.1 which contains tables that were truncated by 20.1. [#66638][#66638]
- A bug has been fixed which prevented the optimizer from producing plans with partial indexes when executing some prepared statements that contained placeholders, or stable functions or casts. This bug was present since partial indexes were added in version 20.2.0. [#66641][#66641]

### Performance improvements

- The `COCKROACHDB_REGISTRY` file is no longer rewritten whenever a new unencrypted file is created. [#66424][#66424]
