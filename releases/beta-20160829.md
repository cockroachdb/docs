### General Changes

- CockroachDB now uses Go 1.7. [#8579](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8579)
- CockroachDB now uses RocksDB 4.9. [#8815](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8815)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- The [`cockroach zone set`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command no longer takes its input directly on the command line. Instead, it accepts a `--file` flag to read from a file, or `--file=-` to read from standard input. [#7953](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7953)

### New Features

- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` can now be used with `JOIN` queries. [#8198](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8198)
- The type `BIT` now works correctly (as a shorthand for `BIT(1)`). The length limit is now enforced. [#8326](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8326)
- The `SHOW` commands now only show tables that the current user has permission to access. [#8070](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8070)
- [Foreign keys](../v1.0/foreign-key.html) can now use a prefix of an index. [#8059](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8059)
- The standard `information_schema` database is now partially supported. New tables will be added to this database in future beta releases. [#7965](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7965), [#8119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8119)

### Bug Fixes

- Clusters with a large number of ranges no longer experience persistently broken connections on node restarts. [#8828](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8828)
- The `RENAME` command now requires the `DROP` privilege on the table or database. It is no longer possible to rename the `system` database. [#7998](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7998)
- The `repeat()` and `substr()` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) with very large numeric arguments will no longer crash the server as easily. [#8073](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8073), [#8078](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8078)
- Certain errors now cause a replica to be marked as corrupt so the corruption will not be replicated to other nodes. [#7684](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7684)
- A `CloseComplete` packet is now sent in response to a `Close` command, improving compatibility with come PostgreSQL client drivers (including the Elixir driver). [#8309](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8309)
- SQL name parsing has been improved to fix several panics and allow foreign key constraints that span databases. [#8152](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8152)
- Fixed some panics. [#8283](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8283), [#8282](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8282)
- Fixed a deadlock if a range grew too large. [#8387](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8387)
- Fixed a race in which multiple conflicting snapshots could be accepted at the same time. [#8365](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8365)
- Decimal values are now represented correctly in the binary protocol. [#8319](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8319)

### Performance Improvements

- Snapshots are now sent synchronously during replica changes. This controls the rate of the replication process and prevents spikes in memory usage that often caused servers to crash. [#8613](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8613)
- Raft logs are now truncated less aggressively, reducing the chance that replication will need to send a snapshot instead of the log. [#8343](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8343), [#8629](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8629), [#8656](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8656)
- Snapshots and the raft log are now written more efficiently. [#8644](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8644)
- Raft log entries are now cached. [#8494](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8494)
- Raft groups are now created lazily at startup. [#8592](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8592)
- Raft heartbeats are now sent less often by default. [#8695](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8695)
- Improved performance and reliability of clusters with large numbers of ranges. [#8125](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8125), [#8162](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8162), [#8495](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8495)
- The heuristics used by the rebalancing system have been improved. [#8124](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8124)
- Some noisy log messages have been removed or reduced. [#8071](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8071), [#8021](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8021), [#8240](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8240), [#8292](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8292), [#8529](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8529), [#8687](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8687), [#8689](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8689)
- The gossip network reconnects more reliably after a failure. [#8128](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8128)
- RPC connections to failed nodes are now detected sooner. [#8163](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8163)
- The cache of the first range descriptor is now properly invalidated. [#8163](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8163)
- Removed replicas are now garbage-collected sooner in many cases. [#8172](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8172)
- The resolution of the block profiler has been reduced, saving CPU. [#8384](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8384)
- Range lease extensions no longer block concurrent reads. [#8352](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8352)

### UI Changes

- The "capacity used" is now computed correctly. [#8048](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8048)
- The CPU and garbage-collection graphs now display averages. [#8048](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8048)
- The Databases section now includes more details. [#8364](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8364)

### Doc Updates

- The new [SQL Feature Support](../v1.0/sql-feature-support.html) page explains which standard SQL features are supported by CockroachDB. [#550](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/550)
- The new Features on Develop Branch page tracks features that are available on the `develop` branch but not yet on `master`. [#552](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/552) (Page no longer available.)
- Added docs on [foreign key constraints](../v1.0/foreign-key.html). [#528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/528)
- Added docs on the [`TRUNCATE`](../v1.0/truncate.html) statement. [#542](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/542)
- Updated [Recommended Production Settings](../v1.0/recommended-production-settings.html) to include cache size recommendations for machines running multiple applications and `systemd`-specific instructions for increasing the file descriptors limit. [#532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/532), [#554](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/554)
- Fixed errors in the commands for [starting CockroachDB in Docker](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker.html). [#567](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/567)
