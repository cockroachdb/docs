### General Changes

- CockroachDB now uses RocksDB version 4.11.2. [#9616](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9616)

### SQL Language Changes

- Additional support for standard database introspection required by popular ORMs. These features apply to built-in tables only; eventually, they will be made available for user-generated tables as well.
  - The `array_agg` [aggregate function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) is now supported for ints and strings. [#12186](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12186)
  - The `ANY`, `SOME` and `ALL` array operators are now supported. [#12102](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12102)
  - `GROUP BY` can now be used with columns of type `ARRAY`. [#12198](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12198)
- The `SET` command now recognizes the `search_path`, `client_encoding`, `standard_conforming_strings`, and `client_min_messages` variables for compatibility with PostgreSQL. Setting these variables currently has no effect. [#12149](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12149)
- The `SHOW server_version` command now returns the version of PostgreSQL that CockroachDB most closely resembles. [#12149](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12149)

### Admin UI Changes

- Aggregated rates are now computed correctly. [#12200](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12200)
- Various stylistic improvements. [#12118](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12118) [#12152](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12152)
- Metrics have been added for lease-related operations. [#12205](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12205)

### Performance Improvements

- Raft snapshots are now applied one at a time. [#12192](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12192)

### Bug Fixes

- The repair system now detects unresponsive nodes more accurately in the event of asymmetric partitions. [#12178](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12178)
- String arrays are now quoted correctly on the wire. [#12268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12268)

### Doc Updates

- Each SQL [constraint](../v1.0/constraints.html) now has a dedicated page of documentation. [#901](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/901)
- The [`cockroach zone`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) documentation now offers minimum and maximum recommendations for the `ttlseconds` setting, which defines the number of seconds overwritten values are retained before garbage collection. [#912](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/912)
