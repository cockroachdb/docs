### Security updates

- HTTP endpoints beginning with `/debug/` now require a valid [`admin`](../v19.1/authorization.html) login session. [#50491][#50491]

### Bug fixes

- Previously, HTTP requests would start to fail with error 503 "`transport: authentication handshake failed: io: read/write on closed pipe`" and never become possible again until restarting the node. This has been fixed. This bug has existed since v2.1 or earlier. [#48483][#48483]
- Previously, when the value passed to `--drain-wait` was very small, but non-zero, [`cockroach quit`](../v19.1/stop-a-node.html) in certain cases would not proceed to perform a hard shutdown. This has been corrected. This bug was present in v19.1.9, v19.2.7, and v20.1.1. [#49365][#49365]
- Fixed a RocksDB bug that could result in inconsistencies in rare circumstances. [#50510][#50510]

### Build changes

- Release Docker images are now built on Debian 9.12. [#50480][#50480]

### Doc updates

- Updated guidance on [node decommissioning](../v19.1/remove-nodes.html). [#7304][#7304]
- Renamed "whitelist/blacklist" terminology to "allowlist/blocklist". [#7535][#7535]
- Updated the Releases navigation in the sidebar to expose the latest Production and Testing releases. [#7550][#7550]
- Fixed scrollbar visibility on Chrome. [#7487][#7487]
