### General changes

New CockroachCloud clusters will now run CockroachDB [v20.2.2](v20.2.2.html).

- CockroachCloud is now offering [larger machine sizes](../cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.html#step-2-select-the-cloud-provider) to be configured directly in the Console. You will now be able to select from four options in the create cluster workflow. The [pricing has also been updated](../cockroachcloud/create-your-cluster.html#step-2-select-the-cloud-provider) for newly created clusters. Existing clusters are not impacted by the pricing changes.
