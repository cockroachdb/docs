### Build Changes

- Binaries are now built with Go 1.10 by default. [#23311][#23311]

### General Changes

- [Logging data](../v2.0/debug-and-error-logs.html) is now flushed to files every second to aid troubleshooting and monitoring. Synchronization to disk is performed separately every 30 seconds. [#23231][#23231]
- Disabling [diagnostics reporting](../v1.1/diagnostics-reporting.html) also disables new version notification checks. [#23007][#23007]
- Removed the `diagnostics.reporting.report_metrics` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html), which is duplicative with the `COCKROACH_SKIP_ENABLING_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORTING` environment variable. [#23007][#23007]
- All internal error messages are now logged when logging is set to a high enough verbosity. [#23127][#23127]

### SQL Language Changes

- Improved handling of large [`DELETE`](../v2.0/delete.html) statements. They are now either allowed to complete or exited with an error message indicating that the transaction is too large to complete. [#23289][#23289]
- The `pg_catalog` virtual tables, as well as the special casts `::regproc` and `::regclass`, can now only be queried by clients that [set a current database](../v2.0/set-database.html). [#23148][#23148]

### Command-Line Changes

- When a node spends more than 30 seconds waiting for an `init` command or to join a cluster, a help message now gets prints to `stdout`. [#23181][#23181]

### Admin UI Changes

- Added a new debug page that allows users to create a "custom" graph displaying any combination of metrics. [#23227][#23227]
- In the geographical map on the homepage of the Admin UI enterprise version, node components now link to **Note Details** page. [#23283][#23283]
- Removed the **Keys Written per Second per Store** graph. [#23303][#23303]
- Added the **Lead Transferee** field to the **Range Debug** page. [#23241][#23241]

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a correctness bug where some `ORDER BY` queries would not return the correct results. [#23541][#23541]
- The Admin UI no longer hangs after a node's network configuration has changed. [#23348][#23348]
- The binary format for [`JSONB`](../v2.0/jsonb.html) values is now supported. [#23215][#23215]
- A node now waits in an unready state for the length of time specified by the `server.shutdown.drain_wait` cluster setting before draining. This helps ensure that load balancers will not send client traffic to a node about to be drained. [#23319][#23319]
- Fixed a panic when using `UPSERT ... RETURNING` with `UNION`. [#23317][#23317]
- Prevented disruptions in performance when gracefully shutting down a node. [#23300][#23300]
- Hardened the [cluster version upgrade](../v2.0/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) mechanism. Rapid upgrades through more than two versions could sometimes fail recoverably. [#23287][#23287]
- Fixed a deadlock when tables are rapidly created or dropped. [#23288][#23288]
- Fixed a small memory leak in [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) CSV. [#23259][#23259]
- Prevented a panic in DistSQL under certain error conditions. [#23201][#23201]
- Added a [readiness endpoint](../v2.0/monitoring-and-alerting.html#health-ready-1) (`/health?ready=1`) for better integration with load balancers. [#23247][#23247]
- Fixed a zero QPS scenario when gracefully shutting down a node. [#23246][#23246]
- Secondary log files (e.g., the SQL execution log) are now periodically flushed to disk, in addition to the flush
  that occurs naturally when single log files are full (`--log-file-max-size`) and when the process terminates gracefully. Log file rotation is also now properly active for these files. [#23231][#23231]
- Previously, the `ranges` column in the `node status` command output only included ranges whose raft leader was on the node in question. It now includes the count of all ranges on the node, regardless of where the raft leader is. [#23180][#23180]
- Fixed a panic caused by empty `COCKROACH_UPDATE_CHECK_URL` or `COCKROACH_USAGE_REPORT_URL` environment variables. [#23008][#23008]
- Prevented stale reads caused by the system clock moving backwards while the `cockroach` process is not running. [#23122][#23122]
- Corrected the handling of cases where a replica fails to retrieve the last processed timestamp of a queue. [#23127][#23127]
- Fixed a bug where the liveness status would not always display correctly on the single-node page in the Admin UI. [#23193][#23193]
- Fixed a bug that showed incorrect descriptions on the **Jobs** page in the Admin UI. [#23256][#23256]
