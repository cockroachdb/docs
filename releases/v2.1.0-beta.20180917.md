### Backward-incompatible changes

- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) created with previous betas and alphas will not work with this version. [#29559][#29559]
- The experimental, non-recommended `kv.allocator.stat_based_rebalancing.enabled` and `kv.allocator.stat_rebalance_threshold` [cluster settings](../v2.1/cluster-settings.html) have been replaced by an improved approach to load-based rebalancing that can be controlled via the new `kv.allocator.load_based_rebalancing` [cluster setting](../v2.1/cluster-settings.html). By default, leases will be rebalanced within a cluster to achieve better QPS balance. [#29663][#29663]

### SQL language changes

- Renamed the `EXPERIMENTAL_OPT` [session setting](../v2.1/set-vars.html) to `OPTIMIZER`. The default value is `ON`, as before. [#29530][#29530]
- Special characters, such as newlines, are now formatted using `octal`, instead of `hex`, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#29593][#29593]

### Command-line changes

- All `cockroach` client sub-commands (except for `cockroach workload`) now support the `--url` flag. [#29621][#29621]
- Removed `--log-backtrace-at` and `--verbosity` flags, which were documented as being only useful by CockroachDB developers yet never actually used by CockroachDB developers. [#30092][#30092]

### Admin UI changes

- Long table rows now wrap, when necessary. [#29551][#29551]
- [Diagnostics](../v2.1/diagnostics-reporting.html) requests are now proxied through Cockroach Labs to prevent exposing user IP addresses. [#29194][#29194]
- Added attributes to the login form to allow LastPass to properly recognize it. [#29561][#29561]
- Custom and regular charts now have the same width. [#30083][#30083]
- Improved the UX of the [**Custom Chart**](../v2.1/admin-ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html) page, and added the ability to configure multiple independent charts. [#30118][#30118]
- Improved the design and accessibility of tooltips. [#30115][#30115]
- Various improvements to the [**Statements**](../v2.1/admin-ui-statements-page.html) pages. [#30115][#30115]
    - Simplified and cleaned-up the appearance.
    - Added statement retries.
    - Right-aligned all numeric stats.
    - Added more tooltips, including for the **By Gateway Node** table on the **Statement Details** page.
    - Improved tooltips by adding a legend detailing the parts of the bar chart.
    - Highlighted summary rows.
    - Improved table headers.
    - Reordered tables to highlight the most useful data.
    - Widened bar charts.
    - Summarized [`SET`](../v2.1/set-vars.html) statements.
    - When a statement fingerprint has sometimes failed, used the optimizer, or been distributed, the number of matching executions is now shown.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that would allow the cluster summary text in the Admin UI to overflow its space. [#29548][#29548]
- Corrected the behavior of `INSERT INTO t DEFAULT VALUES` when there are active schema changes. [#29496][#29496]
- Fixed a race condition in [`IMPORT`](../v2.1/import.html) with a column that was a [collated string](../v2.1/collate.html). [#29386][#29386]
- Fixed crash caused by certain kinds of [`UPSERT ... RETURNING`](../v2.1/upsert.html) statements on tables with active schema changes. [#29543][#29543]
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) now error when a watched table backfills (instead of undefined behavior). [#29559][#29559]
- Fixed a panic that occurs when verbose logging is enabled. [#29534][#29534]
- Fixed a panic caused by inserting values of the wrong type into columns depended on by [computed columns](../v2.1/computed-columns.html). [#29598][#29598]
- Fixed an issue where, under severe load, clients were sometimes receiving [retryable errors](../v2.1/transactions.html#error-handling) with a non-retryable error code. [#29614][#29614]
- The [`cockroach gen haproxy`](../v2.1/generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) command now recognizes nodes that specify the HTTP port number using `--http-addr` instead of `--http-port`. [#29536][#29536]
- Fixed a panic in SQL execution. [#29669][#29669]
- Fixed a panic caused by malformed UTF-8 SQL strings. [#29668][#29668]
- Corrected the Postgres `oid` type returned for collated string columns. [#29674][#29674]
- Enterprise [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) now correctly skip the initial scan when started with the `cursor=` option. [#29613][#29613]
- Hash functions with `NULL` input now return `NULL`. [#29974][#29974]
- Prevented a very rare premature failure in [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) caused by a race condition with range splits. [#30009][#30009]
- Fixed a crash when `SELECT MIN(NULL)` was run with the [SQL optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) enabled. [#30014][#30014]
- Fixed a rare crash with the message `retryable error for the wrong txn`. [#30046][#30046]
- Fixed a bug where certain queries, like merge joins, would appear to run out of memory due to incorrect memory accounting and fail. [#30087][#30087]
- The `string_agg()` [function](../v2.1/functions-and-operators.html) can now accept a `NULL` as a delimiter. [#30076][#30076]

### Performance improvements

- Range replicas are now automatically rebalanced throughout the cluster to even out the amount of QPS being handled by each node. [#29663][#29663]
- Prevented allocation when checking RPC connection health. [#30055][#30055]

### Doc updates

- Updated the description of [correlated subqueries](../v2.1/subqueries.html#correlated-subqueries). More updates coming soon. [#3714](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/3714)
- Update the description of [`cockroach` client connection parameters](../v2.1/connection-parameters.html). [#3715](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/3715)
- Added documentation of the `public` role, which all users belong to. [#3722](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/3722)
- Update the [Diagnostics Reporting](../v2.1/diagnostics-reporting.html) page with a summary of details reported and how to view the details yourself. [#3737](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/3737)
