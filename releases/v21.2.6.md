### Enterprise edition changes

- [Kafka sink](../v21.2/changefeed-sinks.html#kafka) supports larger messages, up to 2GB in size. [#76321][#76321]

### SQL language changes

- Added new [built-in functions](../v21.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) called `crdb_internal.revalidate_unique_constraint`, `crdb_internal.revalidate_unique_constraints_in_table`, and `crdb_internal.revalidate_unique_constraints_in_all_tables`, which can be used to revalidate existing [unique constraints](../v21.2/unique.html). The different variations support validation of a single constraint, validation of all unique constraints in a table, and validation of all unique constraints in all tables in the current database, respectively. If any constraint fails validation, the functions will return an error with a hint about which data caused the constraint violation. These violations can then be resolved manually by updating or deleting the rows in violation. This will be useful to users who think they may have been affected by [#73024][#73024]. [#75858][#75858]
- S3 URIs used in [`BACKUP`](../v21.2/backup.html), [`EXPORT`](../v21.2/export.html), or [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](../v21.2/create-changefeed.html) statements can now include the query parameter `S3_STORAGE_CLASS` to configure the storage class used when that job creates objects in the designated S3 bucket. [#75608][#75608]
- Non-admin users can now use the [`SHOW RANGES`](../v21.2/show-ranges.html) statement if the [`ZONECONFIG`](../v21.2/grant.html#supported-privileges) privilege is granted. [#76071][#76071]
- `ST_MakePolygon` is now disallowed from making empty polygons from empty linestrings. This is not allowed in PostGIS. [#76255][#76255]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where ownership information for sequence descriptors and column descriptors was incorrect. To elaborate, a sequence is created when a column is defined as the [`SERIAL`](../v21.2/serial.html) type and the `serial_normalization` session variable is set to `sql_sequence`. In this case, the sequence is owned by the column and the table where the column exists. The sequence should be dropped when the owner table/column is dropped, which is the PostgreSQL behavior. The bug caused CockroachDB never to set ownership information correctly, only the dependency relationship, which caused the sequence to stay even though the owner table/column did not exist anymore. This is now fixed. [#75704][#75704]
- Fixed a bug that could cause nodes to crash when truncating abnormally large Raft logs. [#75979][#75979]
- The [DB Console](../v21.2/ui-overview.html) [**Databases**](../v21.2/ui-databases-page.html) page now shows stable, consistent values for database sizes. [#76324][#76324]

### Performance improvements

- Sorting data with bytes-like types ([`BYTES`](../v21.2/bytes.html), [`STRING`](../v21.2/string.html), [`JSON`/`JSONB`](../v21.2/jsonb.html), [`UUID`](../v21.2/uuid.html)) when the [`LIMIT`](../v21.2/limit-offset.html) clause is specified has now become more predictable. [#75847][#75847]
