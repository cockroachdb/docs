### Security bug fix

- Fixed a vulnerability in which TLS certificates were not validated correctly for internal RPC interfaces. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user with network access to read and write to the cluster. [#30821](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/30821)

### Command-line changes

- The [`cockroach zone`](../v2.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command is now compatible with CockroachDB v2.1. However, note that `cockroach zone` is also *deprecated* in CockroachDB v2.1 in favor of `ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE` and `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION` statements to update and view replication zones. [#29632][#29632]

### Bug fixes

- The [**Jobs** page](../v2.0/admin-ui-jobs-page.html) now sorts by **Creation Time** by default instead of by **User**. [#30429][#30429]
- Fixed out-of-memory errors caused by very large raft logs. [#28398][#28398] [#28526][#28526]
- Fixed a rare scenario where the value written for one system key was seen when another system key was read, leading to the violation of internal invariants. [#28798][#28798]
- Fixed a memory leak when contended queries time out. [#29100][#29100]
- Fixed a bug causing index creation to fail under rare circumstances. [#29203][#29203]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when not all values were present in a composite foreign key. [#30154][#30154]
- The `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` [foreign key actions](../v2.0/foreign-key.html#foreign-key-actions-new-in-v2-0) no longer cascade through `NULL`s. [#30129][#30129]
- Fixed the occasional improper processing of the `WITH` operand with `IMPORT`/`BACKUP`/`RESTORE` and [common table expressions](../v2.0/common-table-expressions.html). [#30199][#30199]
- Transaction size limit errors are no longer returned for transactions that have already committed. [#30309][#30309]
- Fixed a potential infinite loop when the merge joiner encountered an error or cancellation. [#30380][#30380]
- This release includes the following fixes to the [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) command:
    - The command now properly prints a warning when a `?` character is mistakenly used to receive contextual help in a non-interactive session, instead of crashing. [#28325][#28325]
    - The command now works properly even when the `TERM` environment variable is not set. [#28614][#28614]
    - The commands are now properly able to customize the prompt with `~/.editrc` on Linux. [#28614][#28614]
    - The commands once again support copy-pasting special unicode character from other documents. [#28614][#28614]

### Performance improvements

- Greatly improved the performance of catching up followers that are behind when Raft logs are large. [#28526][#28526]
