### Deprecation Notice

- Integers with a leading zero (e.g., `0755`) are currently treated as octal. In a future release, leading zeros will be ignored and the numbers will be treated as decimal. [#7205](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7205)

### New Features

- `SELECT` statements now accept an `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clause to read values from the recent past (up to the GC policy set in the [zone configuration](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html)). [#7139](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7139)
- [Hexadecimal byte string literals](../v1.0/string.html) of the form `x'f00d'` can now be used to create byte strings containing arbitrary characters. [#7138](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7138)
- `BIGSERIAL` and `SMALLSERIAL` are now supported as aliases for [`SERIAL`](../v1.0/serial.html). All three types use the same 64-bit value size. [#7187](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7187)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a panic in some uses of subqueries. [#6994](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6994), [#7146](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7146)
- [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) now allows the addition of columns with a uniqueness constraint only when the table is empty. [#7094](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7094)
- Improved availability when [`--raft-tick-interval`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html#flags) is increased from its default value. [#7086](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7086)
- Improved reporting of errors from single statements run outside transactions. [#7080](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7080)
- Invalid octal literals (e.g., `09`) no longer crash the server. [#7134](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7134)
- When [`ALTER TABLE`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) fails, it now rolls back dependent items in the correct order. [#6789](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6789)
- [Aggregate functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) like `SUM()` are no longer allowed in `CHECK` or `DEFAULT` expressions. [#7221](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7221)

### Performance Improvements

- Improved rate limiting of snapshots during rebalancing, reducing memory usage and improving availability. [#6878](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6878)
- Splitting a range that has grown beyond the target size is now faster. [#7118](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7118)
- Raft elections are now initiated lazily instead of shortly after server startup. [#7085](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7085)
- The raft log is now garbage-collected more eagerly. [#7125](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7125)
- Increased RocksDB block size, which reduces memory usage. [#7219](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7219)

### Doc Updates

- Docs on the [Built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now cover pretty-printing to the standard output when executing SQL from the command line. The examples have been improved as well. [#373](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/373)
- Docs on the [`STRING`](../v1.0/string.html) and [`INT`](../v1.0/int.html) data types now cover hexadecimal-encoded literal format. Also, the `STRING` docs now cover escape string format. [#392](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/392)
- On [Functions and Operators](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html), functions are now identified as "built-in" or "aggregate". Also, function categorization has been improved. [#379](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/379), [#387](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/387) 
- On [`CREATE INDEX`](../v1.0/create-index.html), the syntax diagram has been clarified and expanded. [#382](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/382)
