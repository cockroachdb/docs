### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- The implementation of indexing for [collated string columns](../v1.0/collate.html) has changed. Any secondary indexes containing collated strings must be [dropped](../v1.0/drop-index.html) before upgrading to this version and then [re-created](../v1.0/create-index.html) after upgrading. Note that this applies only to secondary indexes, not to primary indexes. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

- Any row with a `-0` [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) or [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) value in a primary key or index must be [deleted](../v1.0/delete.html) before upgrading to this version and then [re-inserted](../v1.0/insert.html) after upgrading. Otherwise, the row containing `-0` will show up during table scans, but it will not be possible to delete it or select it as part of an index scan.

  If you suspect `-0` values are present but don't know where, an alternative approach is to use [`cockroach dump`](../v1.0/sql-dump.html) to back up tables with `FLOAT` or `DECIMAL` columns, drop the tables before upgrading, and then use the backup files to recreate the tables and indexes after upgrading. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)

- The `experimental_strptime` and `experimental_strftime` [functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you are currently using these functions, please let us know [here](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/t/are-you-using-experimental-strptime-or-experimental-strftime/545).

- Several undocumented environment variables have been removed. [#14786](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14786) [#14797](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14797)
- Clusters which have used the `COCKROACH_PROPOSER_EVALUATED_KV` environment variable require special care when upgrading to this release; contact us for more information. [#14773](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14773)

### Build Changes

- Building CockroachDB from source no longer uses `$GOPATH/bin` for anything except the final binary produced by `make install`. [#14629](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14629)
- Developers should use `make generate` instead of `go generate` to ensure the correct tool versions are used. [#14672](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14672)

### SQL Language Changes

- SQL variables can now be reset to their default values with the `RESET` statement or `SET x TO DEFAULT`. [#14105](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14105)
- Schema changes within [transactions](../v1.0/transactions.html) are now restricted. Certain combinations of schema changes with other statements (which would previously hang) will now return an error. It is recommended that DDL statements be issued outside of transactions, or as the only statement within a transaction. [#14368](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14368)
- Subqueries are now supported as the source of `UPDATE` statements. [#14611](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14611)
- Timestamp parsing now understands the format used by JDBC's `setTimestamp`. [#14712](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14712)
- [`INTERVAL`](../v1.0/interval.html) values larger than a month now use the suffix `mon` instead of `m` (which is also used for minutes). Intervals can now be parsed from strings containing decimals and negative numbers. [#14534](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14534)
- [`INTERVAL`](../v1.0/interval.html) values now support multiplication and division by [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) values. [#14614](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14614)
- Arithmetic operations on integers now check for overflow. [#14682](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14682)
- Comparisons involving tuples with non-identical types are now allowed whenever the comparison of the individual elements would be allowed. [#14674](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14674)
- The implementation of the `experimental_strptime` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) is now consistent across platforms. [#14801](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14801)
- `BETWEEN` now supports any combination of types that would be supported by individual comparison operators. [#14754](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14754)
- Handling of untyped literals during overload resolution is now more consistent. [#14593](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14593)
- [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](../v1.0/rollback-transaction.html) is now allowed at any time, not only after receiving a "retry transaction" error. [#14538](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14538)
- [`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`](../v1.0/create-table-as.html) now returns the number of rows affected to the SQL client driver. [#13187](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13187)
- [`ALTER TABLE .. ADD CONSTRAINT`](../v1.0/add-constraint.html) can now be used to add a self-referential foreign key. [#14711](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14711)
- The `RETURNING NOTHING` clause can now be used outside of a transaction, although it does not provide any performance benefit in this case. [#14551](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14551)
- [SQL user names](../v1.0/create-user.html) are now required to start with a letter, contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, and be no longer than 63 characters. [#14525](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14525)
- The [`BYTES`](../v1.0/bytes.html) type name is now reported as `bytea` in `pg_catalog.pg_type` for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#14495](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14495)
- The PostgreSQL type IO functions (like `int8in`, `int8out`, `int8send`, and `int8recv`) have dummy implementations for compatibility with some ORMs. [#14529](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14529)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- The [`cockroach zone set`](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command now recognizes the special zone names `.meta`, `.timeseries`, and `.system` to set configurations for system metadata. [#14740](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14740)
- The [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command no longer uses the `COCKROACH_PORT` environment variable; the port must be set on the server's command line (similar to `--host` and other flags). [#14612](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14612)
- The [`cockroach quit`](../v1.0/stop-a-node.html) command is now more robust. [#14775](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14775)
- Command history no longer corrupts previous commands when normalizing them. [#14496](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14496)
- Commands entered as a single line are now saved together in the history. [#14846](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14846)
- The config file generated by [`cockroach gen haproxy`](../v1.0/generate-cockroachdb-resources.html) now enables health checks for the server. [#14624](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14624)
- The `--store` and `--log-dir` flags now reject arguments starting with `~` that were not expanded by the shell. [#14746](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14746)

### Admin UI Changes

- The **Node List** page has been improved. [#14395](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14395)
- A new `node-id` metric with labels for the node's address is now exported for use in external monitoring systems. [#14544](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14544)
- The `/debug/` pages are now accessible only from `localhost` by default. Set the environment variable `COCKROACH_REMOTE_DEBUG=any` when running the server to allow remote access. [#14647](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14647) [#14675](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14675)

### Performance Improvements

- A new, more efficient format is now used for indexes with the [`STORING`](../v1.0/create-index.html#store-columns) clause. Existing indexes will still work, but will need to be dropped and recreated to get the benefits of the new format. [#14758](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14758)
- A single `TimestampCache` is now shared by all replicas on a store, providing better control over memory usage and better support for large transactions. [#14489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14489)
- Reduced memory used by the `TimestampCache`. [#14516](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14516) [#14514](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14514)
- Replica garbage collection is now much more efficient. [#14391](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14391)
- [Adding](../v1.0/add-column.html) and [dropping](../v1.0/drop-column.html) columns now uses the distributed SQL engine. [#14331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14331)
- The health of inter-node connections is now monitored using HTTP/2 ping frames instead of regular RPCs. This ensures that HTTP flow control cannot cause a connection to be considered unhealthy. [#14424](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14424)
- The limit on the number of concurrent inter-node RPCs has been increased. [#14785](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14785)
- The bandwidth used by range snapshots is now limited to 2MB/sec by default to reduce impact on live traffic. [#14718](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14718)
- If a single row grows larger than the configured maximum range size, the split queue will no longer spin trying to split the range repeatedly. [#14654](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14654)
- Several kinds of tracing and logging have been disabled by default. [#14677](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14677)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) and [`DELETE`](../v1.0/delete.html) on tables with [`STORING`](../v1.0/create-index.html#store-columns) indexes. Indexes affected by this bug will need to be dropped and recreated. [#14643](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14643)
- `BETWEEN` now handles `NULL` in the same way as other comparison operators. [#14686](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14686)
- Fixed a bug with comparisons involving division with a constant negative divisor. [#14702](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14702)
- [`INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v1.0/insert.html#update-values-on-conflict) no longer uses an error-prone optimization. The [`UPSERT`](../v1.0/upsert.html) statement is now faster than the equivalent `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement. [#14485](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14485)
- Schema changes now abort more reliably when encountering errors. [#14025](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14025)
- Joining nodes of two different clusters is now detected more reliably. [#14475](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14475)
- Fixed a panic during prepared [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements. [#14481](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14481)
- [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) and [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values in primary keys and indexes now consider `0` and `-0` equal (although the sign will correctly be retained). [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)
- [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values in primary keys and indexes no longer have zeros truncated. If a secondary index contains a `DECIMAL` value with trailing zeros, you can [drop](../v1.0/drop-index.html) and [re-create](../v1.0/create-index.html) the index to have the value returned correctly when the index is used. [#14528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14528)
- Fixed a crash when assigning with the `DEFAULT` keyword in [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html) statements. [#14640](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14640)

### Doc Updates

- Updated the [Start a Local Cluster](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster.html) tutorial to better highlight core CockroachDB capabilities such as automated replications and fault tolerance. [#1257](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1257)
- Expanded the [Build a Ruby App with CockroachDB](../v1.0/build-a-ruby-app-with-cockroachdb-activerecord.html) tutorial to feature the ActiveRecord ORM. [#1234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1234)
- Clarified the `--store` flag in the [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) documentation. [#1243](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1243)
- Updated the [build from source](../v1.0/install-cockroachdb.html) instructions to use a source tarball instead of the `cockroach` GitHub repository. The source tarball downloads faster and doesn't need to be extracted in the `GOPATH`. Developers who want to contribute to CockroachDB should use the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) instead. [#1209](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/1209)
- Added Google Cloud Spanner to the [CockroachDB in Comparison](../v1.0/cockroachdb-in-comparison.html) chart. [#1264](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1264)
