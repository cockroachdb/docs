### SQL language changes

- The following [cluster settings](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) were added or changed: 
  - `sql.defaults.statement_timeout` was added to control the default value for the `statement_timeout` session setting.
  - `sql.defaults.idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` was added to control the default value for the `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` timeout setting.
  - `sql.defaults.idle_in_session_timeout` is now a public cluster setting. [#62185][#62185]

### Bug fixes

- Previously, [changefeeds](../v20.2/change-data-capture.html) were checking the `SELECT` privilege on every descriptor associated with targeted tables, including the database and custom types. They now only check `SELECT` on the targeted tables. [#61661][#61661]
- The names of custom types are no longer sent to Cockroach Labs in telemetry and crash reports. [#61645][#61645]
- Fixed a bug where some import failures would cause tables to stay `OFFLINE` when they should have been brought back to `PUBLIC`. [#61480][#61480]
- Fixed a runtime error observed with a `SpanFromContext` call in the stack trace. [#61703][#61703]
- Exporting data to userfile locations now works correctly. [#61789][#61789]
- The `indexdef` column in the `pg_indexes` table would always report that the index belonged to the public schema. Now it correctly reports user-defined schemas if necessary. [#61753][#61753]
- Previously, when using `SHOW`, the `idle_in_session_timeout` and `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` settings would incorrectly display the value of the `statement_timeout` setting. This is now fixed. [#61958][#61958]
- Fixed a bug where random numbers generated as default expressions during an [`IMPORT`](../v20.2/import.html) would be likely to match (collide with) other generated values in the same column. [#61630][#61630]
- Previously, using [`EXPLAIN (OPT, ENV)`](../v20.2/explain.html) would fail when used on a query that referenced a table in a user-defined schema. This is now fixed. [#61890][#61890]
- Fixed a bug that caused `column does not exist` errors in specific cases of [`UPDATE ... FROM`](../v20.2/update.html) statements. The error occurred when updating a `DECIMAL` column to a column in the `FROM` clause where the column had a `CHECK` constraint or was referenced by a partial index predicate. [#61953][#61953]
- Fixed `command is too large` errors in some cases when using [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DEBUG)`](../v20.2/explain-analyze.html) or statement diagnostics on complex queries. [#61910][#61910]
- Previously, the `target` column of `crdb_internal.zones` would show names without properly accounting for user-defined schemas. This is now fixed. [#62019][#62019]
- Dropping and recreating a view/table/sequence in a transaction will now correctly error out if a conflicting object exists or if the drop is incomplete. [#62343][#62343]
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused queries sent to a freshly restarted node to hang for a long time while the node caught up with replication. [#62204][#62204]
- Previously, the `pg_type_is_visible` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) function did not correctly handle user-defined types. This is now fixed. [#62231][#62231]
- Fix a bug where [full cluster restore](../v20.2/restore.html#full-cluster) would sometimes (very rarely) fail after retrying. [#61217][#61217]
- Fixed a bug where an enum with large numbers of values might cause unexpected errors when attempting to read from tables with columns using that enum. [#62211][#62211]
