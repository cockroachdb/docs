{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}A bug that could cause transactional anomalies was introduced in this release, so this release has been withdrawn.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Enterprise Edition Changes

- [Sequences](../v2.0/create-sequence.html) are now supported in enterprise [`BACKUP`](../v2.0/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v2.0/restore.html) jobs.

    This changes how sequences are stored in the key-value storage layer, so existing sequences must be dropped and recreated. Since a sequence cannot be dropped while it is being used in a column's `DEFAULT` expression, those expressions must be dropped before the sequence is dropped, and recreated after the sequence is recreated. The `setval` function can be used to set the value of a sequence to what it was previously. [#21684][#21684]

### SQL Language Changes

- Casts between [array types](../v2.0/array.html) are now allowed when a cast between the parameter types is allowed. [#22338][#22338]
- Scalar functions can now be used in `FROM` clauses. [#22314][#22314]
- Added privilege checks on [sequences](../v2.0/create-sequence.html). [#22284][#22284]
- The `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`, `ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and `ON UPDATE SET NULL` foreign key constraint actions are now fully supported. [#22220][#22220] [#21767][#21767] [#21716][#21716]
- JSON inverted indexes can now be specified in a [`CREATE TABLE`](../v2.0/create-table.html) statement. [#22217][#22217]
- When a node is gracefully shut down, planning queries are avoided and distributed queries are allowed the amount of time specified by the new `server.drain_max_wait` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) before the node is drained and stopped. [#20450][#20450]
- [Collated string](../v2.0/collate.html) are now supported in [IMPORT](../v2.0/import.html) jobs. [#21859][#21859]
- The new `SHOW GRANTS ON ROLE` statement and `pg_catalog.pg_auth_members` table lists role memberships. [#22205][#22205] [#21780][#21780]
- Role memberships are now considered in permission checks. [#21820][#21820]

### Command-Line Changes

- [Debug commands](../v2.0/debug-zip.html) now open RocksDB in read-only mode. This makes them faster and able to run in parallel. [#21778][#21778]
- The [`cockroach dump`](../v2.0/sql-dump.html) command now outputs `CREATE SEQUENCE` statements before the `CREATE TABLE` statements that use them. [#21774][#21774]
- For better compatibility with `psql`'s extended format, the table formatter `records` now properly indicates line continuations in multi-line rows. [#22325][#22325]
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) client-side option `show_times` is now always enabled when output goes to a terminal, not just when `display_format` is set to `pretty`. [#22326][#22326]
- When formatting `cockroach sql` results with `--format=sql`, the row count is now printed in a SQL comment at the end. [#22327][#22327]
- When formatting `cockroach sql` results with `--format=csv` or `--format=tsv`, result rows that contain special characters are now quoted properly. [#19306][#19306]

### Admin UI Changes

- Added an icon to indicate when descriptions in the **Jobs** table are shortened and expandable. [#22221][#22221]
- Added "compaction queue" graphs to the **Queues** dashboard. [#22218][#22218]
- Added Raft snapshot queue metrics to the **Queue** dashboard. [#22210][#22210]
- When there are dead nodes, they are now show before live nodes on the **Nodes List** page. [#22222][#22222]
- Links to documentation in the Admin UI now point to the docs for v2.0. [#21894][#21894]

### Bug Fixes

- Errors from DDL statements sent by a client as part of a transaction, but in a different query string than the final commit, are no longer silently swallowed. [#21829][#21829]
- Fixed a bug in cascading foreign key actions. [#21799][#21799]
- Tabular results where the column labels contain newline characters are now rendered properly. [#19306][#19306]
- Fixed a bug that prevented long descriptions in the Admin UI **Jobs** table from being collapsed after being expanding. [#22221][#22221]
- Fixed a bug that prevented using `SHOW GRANTS` with a grantee but no targets. [#21864][#21864]
- Fixed a panic with certain queries involving the `REGCLASS` type. [#22310][#22310]
- Fixed the behavior and types of the `encode()` and `decode()` functions. [#22230][#22230]
- Fixed a bug that prevented passing the same tuple for `FROM` and `TO` in `ALTER TABLE ... SCATTER`. [#21830][#21830]
- Fixed a regression that caused certain queries using `LIKE` or `SIMILAR TO` with an indexed column to be slow. [#21842][#21842]
- Fixed a stack overflow in the code for shutting down a server when out of disk space [#21768][#21768]
- Fixed Windows release builds. [#21793][#21793]
- Fixed an issue with the wire-formatting of `BYTES` arrays. [#21712][#21712]
- Fixed a bug that could lead to a node crashing and needing to be reinitialized. [#21771][#21771]
- When a database is created, dropped, or renamed, the SQL session is blocked until the effects of the operation are visible to future queries in that session. [#21900][#21900]
- Fixed a bug where healthy nodes could appear as "Suspect" in the Admin UI if the web browser's local clock was skewed. [#22237][#22237]

### Performance Improvements

- Significantly reduced the likelihood of serializable restarts seen by clients due to concurrent workloads. [#21140][#21140]
- Reduced disruption from nodes recovering from network partitions. [#22316][#22316]
- Improved the performance of scans by copying less data in memory. [#22309][#22309]
- Slightly improved the performance of low-level scan operations. [#22244][#22244]
- When a range grows too large, writes are now be backpressured until the range is successfully able to split. This prevents unbounded range growth and improves a clusters ability to stay healthy under hotspot workloads. [#21777][#21777]
- The `information_schema` and `pg_catalog` databases are now faster to query. [#21609][#21609]
- Reduced the write amplification of Raft replication. [#20647][#20647]

### Doc Updates

- Added [cloud-specific hardware recommendations](../v2.0/recommended-production-settings.html#cloud-specific-recommendations). [#2312](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2312)
- Added a [detailed listing of SQL standard features with CockroachDB's level of support](../v2.0/sql-feature-support.html). [#2442](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2442)
- Added docs on the [`INET`](../v2.0/inet.html) data type. [#2439](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2439)
- Added docs on the [`SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE`](../v2.0/show-create-sequence.html) statement. [#2406](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2406)
