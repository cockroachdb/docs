### Enterprise edition changes

- Added a setting to opt in or out of including [SQL statistics](../v20.1/create-statistics.html) in [backups](../v20.1/backup.html). [#55879][#55879]

### SQL language changes

- Parsing [intervals](../v20.1/interval.html) with fractional years now produces intervals with no more precision than months, to match the behavior of PostgreSQL. [#56247][#56247]
- Table names are now listed before index names in [`EXPLAIN (DISTSQL)`](../v20.1/explain.html) diagram output. Previously, the diagrams used `index@table`, and now they use `table@index`. [#56396][#56396]

### Bug fixes

- [Changefeeds](../v20.1/changefeed-for.html) were previously incompatible with the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.1/vectorized-execution.html), and creating changefeeds with the vectorized engine enabled could cause a server to hang. This could happen in v20.2 releases with `SET vectorize_row_count_threshold=0;`, and in v20.1 releases with `SET vectorize=on`. This bug is now fixed. [#55754][#55754]
- Fixed possible write skew in distributed queries that have both zigzag [joins](../v20.1/joins.html) and table readers with the zigzag joins reading keys not read by the table readers. [#55874][#55874]
- CockroachDB previously could return incorrect results when computing [aggregation functions](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) when some of the functions contained a `DISTINCT` clause and some did not. This bug is now fixed. [#55873][#55873]
- CockroachDB previously could incorrectly evaluate the `sqrdiff` function when used as a [window function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html#window-functions) in some cases. This bug is now fixed. [#55999][#55999]
- Fixed a `top-level relational expression cannot have outer columns` error in some queries that involve `WITH`. [#56086][#56086]
- Fix a bug causing [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html)s of malformed Avro records to hang forever. [#56097][#56097]
- Fixed a bug causing CockroachDB to crash when a [`BACKUP`](../v20.1/backup.html) query was unable to count the total nodes in the cluster. [#56096][#56096]
- Fixed an error that could occur at the end of a restoration of a backup that had ongoing [schema change jobs](../v20.1/online-schema-changes.html). [#56021][#56021]
- Previously, cluster backups created in releases before v20.2 could not be [restored](../v20.1/restore.html) in 20.2 clusters, and would produce an error message about failing to restore a system table. This bug is now fixed. [#56024][#56024]
- [Options set on users](../v20.1/alter-user.html) (e.g. `ALTER USER <username> CREATEDB`) were not included in cluster backups and thus not restored. Role options are now included in cluster backups. [#55442][#55442]
- Fixed a bug that did not respect disabling [protected timestamp settings](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html) with zero values. [#56454][#56454]
- Fixed a bug which that result in a failed restore when restoring into a database with a different set of [privileges](../v20.1/authorization.html) than the backup privileges. [#55880][#55880]
- Fixed a race between job completion and sending the result of the job to the client. CockroachDB now sends results to the client after a job completes. [#56146][#56146]
- In [v20.1.8](v20.1.8.html), we attempted to fix the `age()` [function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html)'s normalization of `H:M:S` input into years, months, and days. However, the v20.1.8 fix was broken for values greater than 1 month, and for `a::timestamp(tz) - b::timestamp(tz)` expressions. This bug has been resolved. [commit 59b2bc218][59b2bc218]
