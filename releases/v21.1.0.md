### Enterprise features

These features require an [enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/). Use [`cockroach demo`](../v21.1/cockroach-demo.html) to test enterprise features in a local, temporary cluster.

Area | Feature | Description
--------|---------|------------
SQL | **Multi-Region Improvements** | It is now much easier to leverage CockroachDB's low-latency, resilient multi-region capabilities. For an introduction to the high-level concepts, see the [Multi-Region Overview](../v21.1/multiregion-overview.html). For further details and links to related SQL statements, see [Choosing a Multi-Region Configuration](../v21.1/choosing-a-multi-region-configuration.html), [When to Use ZONE vs. REGION Survival Goals](../v21.1/when-to-use-zone-vs-region-survival-goals.html), and [When to Use REGIONAL vs. GLOBAL Tables](../v21.1/when-to-use-regional-vs-global-tables.html). For a demonstration of these capabilities using a local cluster, see the [Multi-Region Tutorial](../v21.1/demo-low-latency-multi-region-deployment.html). Finally, for details about related architectural enhancements, see [Non-Voting Replicas](../v21.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#non-voting-replicas) and [Non-Blocking Transactions](../v21.1/transaction-layer.html#non-blocking-transactions).

### Core featurees

These features are freely available in the core version and do not require an enterprise license.

Area | Feature | Description
--------|---------|------------
SQL | **`EXPLAIN` Improvements** | The responses of [`EXPLAIN`](../v21.1/explain.html) and [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v21.1/explain-analyze.html) have been unified and extended with additional details, including automatic statistics-backed row estimates for `EXPLAIN`, and maximum memory usage, network usage, nodes used per operator, and rows used per operator for `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
SQL | **Inverted Joins** | CockroachDB now supports [inverted joins](../v21.1/joins.html#inverted-joins), which force the optimizer to use an inverted index on the right side of the join. Inverted joins can only be used with `INNER` and `LEFT` joins.
SQL | **Partial Inverted Indexes** | You can now create a [partial inverted index](../v21.1//inverted-indexes.html#partial-inverted-indexes) on a subset of `JSON`, `ARRAY`, or geospatial container column data.
SQL | **Virtual Computed Columns** | You can create [virtual computed column](../v21.1/computed-columns.html), which are not stored on disk and are recomputed as the column data in the expression changes.
SQL | **Renaming and Dropping User-Defined Types** | It's now possible to [rename a user-defined type](../v21.1/alter-type.html#rename-a-user-defined-type) and [drop a value in a user-defined type](../v21.1/alter-type.html#drop-a-value-in-a-user-defined-type).
Dev Tools | **ORM Compatibility for Spatial** | [Spatial libraries for Hibernate, ActiveRecord, and Django](../v21.1/spatial-data.html#orm-compatibility) are now fully compatible with CockroachDB's spatial features.
Dev Tools | **Connection Pooling Guidance** | Creating the appropriate size pool of connections is critical to gaining maximum performance in an application. For guidance on sizing, validating, and using connection pools with CockroachDB, as well as examples for Java and Go applications, see [Use Connection Pools](../v21.1/use-connection-pools.html).
I/O | **Import from Local Dump File** | The new [`cockroach import`](../v21.1/cockroach-import.html) command imports a database or table from a local `PGDUMP` or `MYSQLDUMP` file into a running cluster. This is useful for quick imports of 15MB or smaller. For larger imports, use the [`IMPORT`](../v21.1/import.html) statement.

### Backward-incompatible changes

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v21.1](../v20.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes and adjust your deployment as necessary.

- Rows containing empty arrays in [`ARRAY`](../v21.1/array.html) columns are now contained in [inverted indexes](../v21.1/inverted-indexes.html). This change is backward-incompatible because prior versions of CockroachDB will not be able to recognize and decode keys for empty arrays. Note that rows containing `NULL` values in an indexed column will still not be included in inverted indexes.
- Concatenation between a non-null argument and a null argument is now typed as string concatenation, whereas it was previously typed as array concatenation. This means that the result of `NULL || 1` will now be `NULL` instead of `{1}`. To preserve the old behavior, the null argument can be casted to an explicit type.
- The payload fields for certain event types in `system.eventlog` have been changed and/or renamed. Note that the payloads in `system.eventlog` were an undocumented, reserved feature so no guarantee was made about cross-version compatibility to this point. The list of changes includes (but is not limited to):
  - `TargetID` has been renamed to `NodeID` for `node_join`.
  - `TargetID` has been renamed to `TargetNodeID` for `node_decommissioning` / `node_decommissioned` / `node_recommissioned`.
  - `NewDatabaseName` has been renamed to `NewDatabaseParent` for `convert_to_schema`.
  - `grant_privilege` and `revoke_privilege` have been removed; they are replaced by `change_database_privilege`, `change_schema_privilege`, `change_type_privilege`, and `change_table_privilege`. Each event only reports a change for one user/role, so the `Grantees` field was renamed to `Grantee`.
  - Each `drop_role` event now pertains to a single [user/role](../v21.1/authorization.html#sql-users).
- The connection and authentication logging enabled by the [cluster settings](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) `server.auth_log.sql_connections.enabled` and `server.auth_log.sql_sessions.enabled` was previously using a text format which was hard to parse and integrate with external monitoring tools. This has been changed to use the standard notable event mechanism, with standardized payloads. The output format is now structured; see the generated [reference documentation](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/generated/eventlog.md) for details about the supported event types and payloads.
- The logging format for [SQL audit](../v21.1/sql-audit-logging.html), [execution](../v21.1/query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#cluster-wide-execution-logs), and [query](../v21.1/query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#slow-query-logs) logs has changed from a crude space-delimited format to JSON. To opt out of this new behavior and restore the pre-v21.1 logging format, you can set the [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html) `sql.log.unstructured_entries.enabled` to `true`.
- The [`cockroach debug ballast`](../v21.1/cockroach-debug-ballast.html) command now refuses to overwrite the target ballast file if it already exists. This change is intended to prevent mistaken uses of the `ballast` command by operators. Scripts that integrate `cockroach debug ballast` can consider adding a `rm` command.
- Removed the `kv.atomic_replication_changes.enabled` [cluster setting](../v21.1/cluster-settings.html). All replication changes on a range now use joint-consensus.

### Deprecations

- The CLI flags `--log-dir`, `--log-file-max-size`, `--log-file-verbosity`, `--log-group-max-size` are deprecated. Logging configuration can now be specified via the `--log` parameter. See the documentation for details.  
- The client-side command `\show` for the [SQL shell](../v21.1/cockroach-sql.html#commands) is deprecated in favor of the new command `\p`. This prints the contents of the query buffer entered so far.

### Known limitations

For information about new and unresolved limitations in CockroachDB v21.1, with suggested workarounds where applicable, see [Known Limitations](../v21.1/known-limitations.html).
