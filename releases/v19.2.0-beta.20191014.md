### SQL language changes

- The new `SHOW RANGE ... FOR ROW` statement identifies the range containing a specific row of a table or secondary index. This is particularly useful for validating the location of a specific piece of data when using [partitions](../v19.2/topology-geo-partitioned-replicas.html) to control data location for improved performance or GDPR compliance. Note that this new statement is **experimental** and its interface and output are subject to change. [#40954][#40954]
- The [`SHOW PARTITIONS`](../v19.2/show-partitions.html) statement now displays inherited as well as explicitly set zone configurations for partitions. Also, it is now possible to retrieve full zone configurations via the `full_config_sql` column in the `crdb_internal.zones` table, and the new `zone_id` and `subzone_id` columns in the `crdb_internal.partitions` table point to partitions' corresponding zone configurations in `crdb_internal.zones`. [#40493][#40493]

### Command-line changes

- When `vmodule` is set to `exec_logs=2` to [log queries executed by a node](../v19.2/query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#per-node-execution-logs), CockroachDB-generated statements are no longer logged alongside client-generated statements. To log CockroachDB-generated statements as well, you must now use `exec_logs=3`. [#41149][#41149]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that would cause queries combining SQL mutation statements in sub-queries inside `UNION` to return invalid results or to modify the wrong rows if the transaction is forced to retry. [#41307][#41307]
- Fixed a bug that prevented changes to the `kv.bulk_io_write.concurrent_addsstable_requests` [cluster setting](../v19.2/cluster-settings.html) from taking effect. [#41195][#41195]
- Fixed a memory leak that affected secondary logging (SQL audit logs, statement execution, and RocksDB logging). [#41231][#41231]
- Fixed a bug where zone configuration changes on tables with existing index zone configurations would not take effect unless the `num_replicas` field was also set. [#41261][#41261]
- Fixed a bug where zone configuration changes on secondary indexes wouldn't perform setting verification, such as constraints with lease preferences or setting only one of `min_range_size` and `max_range size`. [#41216][#41216]
- Fixed a rare data corruption bug in RocksDB caused by newer Linux kernels' handling of `i_generation` on certain filesystems. [#41346][#41346]

### Performance improvements

- Stabilized performance of [`IMPORT`](../v19.2/import.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v19.2/restore.html) by changing the default value of the `rocksdb.ingest_backpressure.pending_compaction_threshold` [cluster setting](../v19.2/cluster-settings.html) from 64 GiB to 2 GiB. [#41263][#41263]

### Doc updates

- Expanded the architecture documentation to describe the new [Parallel Commits](../v19.2/architecture/transaction-layer.html#parallel-commits) protocol, which cuts the commit latency of a transaction in half, from two rounds of consensus down to one. [#5394][#5394]
- The tutorial on getting [Low Latency Reads and Writes in a Multi-Region Cluster](../v19.2/demo-low-latency-multi-region-deployment.html) now features two of the most important multi-region data topologies, [Geo-Partitioned Replicas](../v19.2/topology-geo-partitioned-replicas.html) and [Duplicate Indexes](../v19.2/topology-duplicate-indexes.html), to dramatically reduce the impact of network latency. [#5558][#5558]
- Documented the new [`cockroach start-single-node`](../v19.2/cockroach-start-single-node.html) cli command, which starts a single-node cluster with replication disabled for quick SQL testing or app development. [#5445][#5445]
- Documented how to use `SPLIT AT ... WITH EXPIRATION` SQL statement to [set an expiration on a range split](../v19.2/split-at.html#set-the-expiration-on-a-split-enforcement) as well as how to remove a split enforcement via [`UNSPLIT AT`](../v19.2/unsplit-at.html). [#5360][#5360]
- Updated hardware recommendations in the [Production Checklist](../v19.2/recommended-production-settings.html#hardware). [#5472][#5472]
- Clarified the benefit of [merge joins over hash joins](../v19.2/joins.html#merge-joins). [#5464][#5464]
- Updated the [recommendations for improving `IMPORT` performance](../v19.2/import.html#performance). [#5452][#5452]
- Documented the [`ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL`](../v19.2/alter-column.html#set-not-null-constraint) SQL statement, which adds a non-null constraint to an existing column. [#5456][#5456]
- Documented how to use the `pg_collation_for()` built-in function, or its alternative syntax form `COLLATION FOR`, to [return the locale name of a collated string](../v19.2/collate.html#show-collation-for-strings). [#5576][#5576]
- Documented how to use [`SHOW BACKUP SCHEMAS`](../v19.2/show-backup.html#show-a-backup-with-schemas) SQL statement to list the schemas of enterprise backups alongside their contents. [#5455][#5455]
- Updated the [SQL statements that are allowed as row sources for table expressions](../v19.2/table-expressions.html#using-the-output-of-other-statements).
- Documented how to use the [`SHOW JOBS WHEN COMPLETED`](../v19.2/show-jobs.html#show-job-when-complete) SQL statement to list only just that have completed. [#5395][#5395]
- Documented the [`skip_missing_views`](../v19.2/restore.html#skip_missing_views) option for the `RESTORE` SQL statement, which restores a table with a view but does not restore the view's dependencies.
- Documented the [`--display-every` and `--display-format` flags for the `cockroach workload` cli command](../v19.2/cockroach-workload.html#customize-the-frequency-and-format-of-per-operation-statistics), which control the frequency and format of per-operation statistics. [#5424][#5424]
- Documented the [naming requirements for CSR names](../v19.2/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html#csr-names) when orchestrating CockroachDB with Kubernetes. [#5422][#5422]
- Documented the [`--watch` flag for the `cockroach sql` cli command](../v19.2/cockroach-sql.html#repeat-a-sql-statement), which repeats the SQL statements specified with `--execute` or `-e` until a SQL error occurs or the process is terminated. [#5543][#5543]
- Documented how to use the JDBC driver to [retrieve large data sets in chunks using cursors](../v19.2/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html#retrieve-large-data-sets-in-chunks-using-cursors). [#5544][#5544]
- Clarified that [`CHANGEFEED` cursors must be in quotes](../v19.2/create-changefeed.html#options). [#5529][#5529]
- Documented how to [show the locality of a node using the `crdb_internal.locality_value()` built-in function](../v19.2/show-locality.html#show-locality-with-a-built-in-function). [#5540][#5540]
- Documented how to [reference a common table expression (CTE) multiple times in a single query, using a `WITH` operator](../v19.2/common-table-expressions.html#reusing-common-table-expressions). [#5485][#5485]
