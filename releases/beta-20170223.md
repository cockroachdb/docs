### SQL Language Changes

- Fixed parsing of interval constants with precision modifiers such as `INTERVAL '5' YEARS`. [#13702](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13702)
- String literals containing `true`, `false`, or their synonyms (but not placeholders or other expressions of type string) can now be used where a `BOOL` is required. [#13685](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13685)
- The underlying implementation of the `DECIMAL` type has been replaced. This may change the results of some calculations. The default rounding behavior for `DECIMAL` values is now "half away from zero", which is consistent with PostgreSQL. [#13551](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13551)
- The column headers in the results of `SHOW` commands are now lower-case to match PostgreSQL. [#13484](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13484)
- The `pg_index.indkey` column is now an `int2vector`, improving compatibility with Sequelize. [#13484](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13484)
- Improved support for arrays (still limited to the `pg_catalog` tables). [#13636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13636) [#13535](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13535)
- The output of `SHOW USERS` is now sorted. [#13661](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13661)

### Admin UI Changes

- A new graph displays the execution latency for SQL statements. [#12790](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12790)
- A new "All Events" page displays cluster history. [#13093](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13093)
- New metrics for round-trip time between nodes are now recorded. [#13533](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13533)
- Fixed-width fonts now correctly use Inconsolata. [#13631](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13631)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in error handling that could causes ranges to get stuck if an error occurred during a rebalance. [#13605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13605)
- Retry table lease errors during schema changes, preventing them from getting stuck. [#13606](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13606)
- Inter-node connections are now closed on heartbeat timeouts, improving the handling of network partitions. [#13654](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13654)

### Performance Improvements

- Metadata for queries using unqualified table names is now cached, speeding up these queries by 130%. [#13635](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13635)
- Eliminated an unnecessary sort phase in table scans, making `cockroach dump` usable on larger tables. [#13703](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13703)
- Leases and replicas will no longer be transferred to nodes that are draining. [#11724](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/11724) [#13601](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13601)
- Reduced unnecessary copying and allocations. [#13660](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13660) [#13649](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13649)
