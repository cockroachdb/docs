### General Changes

- Alpha and beta releases are now published as [Docker images under the name cockroachdb/cockroach-unstable](https://hub.docker.com/r/cockroachdb/cockroach-unstable/). [#20331](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20331)

### SQL Language Changes

- The protocol statement tag for [`CREATE TABLE ... AS ...`](../v2.0/create-table-as.html) is now [`SELECT`](../v2.0/select-clause.html), like in PostgreSQL. [#20268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20268)
- OIDs can now be compared with inequality operators. [#20367](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20367)
- The [`CANCEL JOB`](../v2.0/cancel-job.html) statement now supports canceling [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) jobs. [#20343](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20343)
- [`PAUSE JOB`](../v2.0/pause-job.html)/[`RESUME JOB`](../v2.0/resume-job.html)/[`CANCEL JOB`](../v2.0/cancel-job.html) statements can now be used within SQL [transactions](../v2.0/transactions.html). [#20185](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20185)
- Added a cache for the internal `system.table_statistics` table. [#20212](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20212)
- The `intervalstyle` [session variable](../v2.0/set-vars.html) is now supported for PostgreSQL compatibility. [#20274](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20274)
- The [`SHOW [KV] TRACE`](../v2.0/show-trace.html) statement now properly extracts file/line number information when analyzing traces produced in debug mode. Also, the new `SHOW COMPACT [KV] TRACE` statement provides a more compact view on the same data. [#20093](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20093)
- Some queries using `IS NOT NULL` conditions are now better optimized. [#20436](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20436)
- [Views](../v2.0/views.html) now support `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`. [#20246](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20246)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- Reduced temporary disk space usage for the `cockroach debug compact` command. [#20460](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20460)
- The [`cockroach node status`](../v2.0/view-node-details.html) and [`cockroach node ls`](../v2.0/view-node-details.html) commands now support a timeout. [#20308](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20308)

### Admin UI Changes

- The Admin UI now sets the `Last-Modified` header when serving assets to permit browser caching. This improves page load times, especially on slow connections [#20429](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20429).

### Bug Fixes

- Removed the possibility for OOM errors during distributed [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) from csv. [#20506](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20506)
- Fixed a crash triggered by some corner-case queries containing [`ORDER BY`](../v2.0/query-order.html). [#20489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20489)
- Added missing Distributed SQL flows to the exported `sql.distsql.flows.active` and `sql.distsql.flows.total` metrics and the "Active Flows for Distributed SQL Queries" admin UI graph. [#20503](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20503)
- Fixed an issue with stale buffer data when using the binary format for [`ARRAY`](../v2.0/array.html) values. [#20461](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20461)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell now better reports the number of rows inserted by a [`CREATE TABLE ... AS ...`](../v2.0/create-table-as.html) statement. Note,  however, that the result are still formatted incorrectly if the `CREATE TABLE ... AS ...` statement creates zero rows in the new table. [#20268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20268)
- Self-referencing tables can now reference a non-primary index without manually adding an index on the referencing column. [#20325](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20325)
- Fixed an issue where spans for descending indexes were displaying incorrectly and updated `NOT NULL` tokens from `#` to `!NULL`. [#20318](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20318)
- Fixed `BACKUP` jobs to correctly resume in all conditions. [#20185](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20185)
- Fix various race conditions with jobs. [#20185](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20185)
- It is no longer possible to use conflicting `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clauses in different parts of a query. [#20267](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20267)
- Fixed a panic caused by dependency cycles with `cockroach dump`. [#20255](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20255)
- Prevented context cancellation during lease acquisition from leaking to coalesced requests. [#20424](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20424)

### Performance Improvements

- Improved handling of `IS NULL` conditions. [#20366](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20366)
- Improved p99 latencies for garbage collection of previous versions of a key, when there are many versions. [#20373](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20373)
- Smoothed out disk usage under very write heavy workloads by syncing to disk more frequently. [#20352](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20352)
- Improved garbage collection of very large [transactions](../v2.0/transactions.html) and large volumes of abandoned write intents. [#20396](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20396)
- Improved table scans and seeks on interleaved parent tables by skipping interleaved children rows at the end of a scan. [#20235](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20235)
- Replaced the interval tree structure in `TimestampCache` with arena-backed concurrent skiplist. This reduces global locking and garbage collection pressure, improving average and tail latencies. [#20300](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20300)

### Doc Updates

- Added an [introduction to CockroachDB video](../v2.0/). [#2234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2234)
- Clarified that we have tested the PostgreSQL-compatible drivers and ORMs featured in our documentation enough to claim **beta-level** support. This means that applications using advanced or obscure features of a driver or ORM may encounter incompatibilities. If you encounter problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/new) with details to help us make progress toward full support.
