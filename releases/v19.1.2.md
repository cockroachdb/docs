### Enterprise edition changes

- You can now alter the zone configuration for a secondary index partition using the syntax `ALTER PARTITION OF INDEX <tablename>@<indexname> CONFIGURE ZONE ...`. [#36883][#36883] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- CockroachDB now computes the result of shifting bit arrays to the right properly and avoids generating invalid bit arrays. [#36751][#36751]
- `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION` no longer emits invalid `ALTER` syntax in its output when displaying the zone configuration for a table or index partition that is inheriting from the database or the default configuration. [#36883][#36883]
- `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION FOR TABLE t PARTITION p` no longer ignores the clause `PARTITION p` and now properly displays the zone configuration for that partition instead. [#36883][#36883]
- Automated table statistics no longer encounter "batch timestamp must be after replica GC threshold" errors on configurations with low TTL. [#37588][#37588]
- Fixed type inference of columns in subqueries for some expressions of the form `scalar IN (subquery)`. [#37598][#37598]
- Fixed a panic when constructing the error message for an invalid partitioning. [#37703][#37703]
- Fixed a potential source of (faux) replica inconsistencies that can be reported while running a mixed v19.1 / v2.1 cluster. This error (in that situation only) is benign and can be resolved by upgrading to the latest v19.1 patch release. Every time this error occurs, a "checkpoint" is created which will occupy a large amount of disk space and which needs to be removed manually (see `<store directory>/auxiliary/checkpoints`). [#37722][#37722]
- Fixed a case in which [`cockroach quit`](../v19.1/stop-a-node.html) would return successfully even though the server process was still running in a severely degraded state. [#37722][#37722]
- Fixed incorrect results or "incorrectly ordered stream" errors in response to some queries with aggregations, and improved the `EXPLAIN` output for aggregations. [#37792][#37792]
- A `NULL` right operand now causes the sub-operator expression to return `NULL`. [#37886][#37886]
- The `age()` function is now correctly marked as impure, causing it to be unavailable in certain contexts. [#37922][#37922]
- Certain binary encodings of numeric/decimal values no longer result in values that are an order of magnitude off. [#37921][#37921]
- Fixed a race condition that could cause a panic during query planning. [#37974][#37974]
- Fixed `GROUP BY` for empty arrays. [#37940][#37940]
- Fixed a bug when estimating result set sizes in the optimizer that caused queries involving very large integer ranges to have poor plans. [#38038][#38038]
- The [`cockroach` commands](../v19.1/cockroach-commands.html) that internally use a RPC connection (e.g., `cockroach quit`, `cockroach init`, etc.) once again properly support passing an IPv6 address literal via the `--host` argument. [#37982][#37982]
- The [`cockroach init`](../v19.1/initialize-a-cluster.html) command will now always properly report when a cluster is already initialized, even after the node that it's connecting to is restarted. [#37593][#37593]

### Security improvements

- Stack memory used by CockroachDB is now marked as non-executable, improving security and compatibility with SELinux. [#38011][#38011]
