{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}A bug that could trigger an assertion failure was discovered in this
release. Bringing up a node too soon after the assertion fired could introduce consistency problems, so this release has been withdrawn.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

<!--
### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- Removed the obsolete `kv.gc.batch_size` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html). [#21070](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21070)
- Removed the `COCKROACH_METRICS_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` environment variable. Users that relied on it should reduce the value for the `timeseries.resolution_10s.storage_duration` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) instead. [#20810](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20810)

### General Changes

- CockroachDB now proactively rebalances data when the diversity of the localities that a given range is located on can be improved. [#19489](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19489)
- Clusters are now initialized with default `.meta` and `.liveness` replication zones with lower GC TTL configurations. [#17628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17628)

### SQL Language Changes

- The new `SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE` statement shows the [`CREATE SEQUENCE`](../v2.0/create-sequence.html) statement that would create a carbon copy of the specified sequence. [#21208](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21208)
- The [`DROP COLUMN`](../v2.0/drop-column.html) statement now drops [`CHECK`](../v2.0/check.html) constraints. [#21203](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21203)
- The `pg_sequence_parameters()` built-in function is now supported. [#21069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21069)
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign key constraints are now fully supported and memory bounded. [#20064](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20064) [#20706](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20706)
- For improved troubleshooting, more complete and useful details are now reported to clients when SQL errors are encountered. [#19793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19793)
- The new `SHOW SYNTAX` statement allows clients to analyze arbitrary SQL syntax server-side and retrieve either the (pretty-printed) syntax decomposition of the string or the details of the syntax error, if any. This statement is intended for use in the CockroachDB interactive SQL shell. [#19793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19793)
- Enhanced type checking of subqueries in order to generalize subquery support. As a side-effect, fixed a crash with subquery edge cases such as `SELECT (SELECT (1, 2)) IN (SELECT (1, 2))`. [#21076](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21076)
- Single-use common table expressions are now supported. [#20359](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20359)
- Statement sources with no output columns are now disallowed. [#20998](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20998)

- The `sql_safe_updates` session variable now defaults to `false` unless the shell is truly interactive (using `cockroach sql`, `-e` not specified, standard input not redirected) and `--unsafe-updates` is not specified. Previously, `sql_safe_updates` would always default to `true` unless `--unsafe-updates` was specified. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- The `errexit` client-side option now defaults to `false` only if the shell is truly interactive, not only when the input is not redirected as previously. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- The `display_format` client-side option now defaults to `pretty` in every case where the output goes to a terminal, not only when the input is not redirected as previously. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- The `check_syntax` and `smart_prompt` client-side options, together with the interactive line editor, are only enabled if the session is interactive and output goes to a terminal. [#20805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20805)
- Table aliases are now permitted in `RETURNING` clauses. [#20808](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20808)

- For compatibility with PostgreSQL and related tools:
    - Parsing of the `COMMENT ON` syntax is now allowed. [#21063](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21063)
    - The following built-in functions are now supported: `pg_catalog.pg_trigger()`, `pg_catalog.pg_rewrite()`, `pg_catalog.pg_operator()`, `pg_catalog.pg_user_mapping()`, `pg_catalog.foreign_data_wrapper()`, `pg_get_constraintdef()`, `inet_client_addr()`, `inet_client_port()`, `inet_server_addr()`, `inet_server_port()`. [#21065](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21065) [#20788](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20788)
    - Missing columns have been added to `information_schema.columns`, and the `pg_catalog.pg_user()` virtual table has been added. [#20788](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20788)
    - A string cast to `regclass` is interpreted as a possibly qualified name like `db.name`. [#20788](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20788)
    - Rendered columns for built-in functions are now titled by the name of the built-in function. [#20820](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20820)

### Command-Line Changes

- Client `cockroach` commands that use SQL (`cockroach sql`, `cockroach node ls`, etc.) now print a warning if the server is running an older version of CockroachDB than the client. Also, this and other warning messages are now clearly indicated with the "warning:" prefix. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- Client-side syntax checking performed by [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) when the `check_syntax` option is enabled has been enhanced for forward-compatibility with later CockroachDB versions. [#21119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21119)
- The `\?` [client-side command](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html#sql-shell-commands) of `cockroach sql` now prints out a description of each option. [#21119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21119)
- The `--unsafe-updates` of `cockroach sql` was renamed to `--safe-updates`. The default behavior is unchanged: The previous flag defaulted to `false`; the new flag defaults to `true`. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- The `cockroach sql` command no longer fails when the server is running a version of CockroachDB that does not support the sql_safe_updates session variable. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)

### Admin UI Changes

- Added graphs of node liveness heartbeat latency, an important internal signal of health, to the **Distributed** dashboard. [#21002](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21002)
- **Capacity Used** is now shown as "-" instead of 100% when the UI cannot load the real data from the server. [#20824](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20824)
- Removed a redundant rendering of the GC pause time from the **CPU Time** graph. [#20802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20802)
- The **Databases** page now reports table sizes that are better approximations to actual disk space usage. [#20627](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20627)
- Added a system table to allow operators to designate geographic coordinates for any locality. This is for use with upcoming cluster visualization functionality in the Admin UI. [#19652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/19652)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the `debug compact` command to compact all sstables. [#21293](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21293)
- Fixed tuple equality to evaluate correctly in the presence of NULL elements. [#21230](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21230)
- Fixed a bug where the temporary directory was being wiped on failed CockroachDB restart, causing importing and DistSQL queries to fail. [#20854](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20854)
- The "JSON" column in the output of `EXPLAIN(DISTSQL)` is now properly hidden by default. It can be shown using `SELECT *, JSON FROM [EXPLAIN(DISTSQL) ...]`. [#21154](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21154)
- `EXPLAIN` queries with placeholders no longer panic. [#21168](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/21168)
- The `--safe-updates` flag of `cockroach sql` can now be used effectively in non-interactive sessions. [#20935](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20935)
- Fixed a bug where non-matching interleaved rows were being inner-joined with their parent rows. [#20938](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20938)
- Fixed an issue where seemingly irrelevant error messages were being returned for certain `INSERT` statements. [#20841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20841)
- Crash details are now properly copied to the log file even when a node was started with `--logtostderr` as well as in other circumstances when crash details could be lost previously. [#20839](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20839)
- It is no longer possible to log in as a non-existent user in insecure mode. [#20800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20800)
- The `BIGINT` type alias is now correctly shown when using `SHOW CREATE TABLE`. [#20798](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20798)
- Fixed a scenario where a range that is too big to snapshot can lose availability even with a majority of nodes alive. [#20589](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20589)
- Fixed `BETWEEN SYMMETRIC`, which was incorrectly considered an alias for `BETWEEN`. Per the SQL99 specification, `BETWEEN SYMMETRIC` is like `BETWEEN`, except that its arguments are automatically swapped if they would specify an empty range. [#20747](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20747)
- Fixed a replica corruption that could occur if a process crashed in the middle of a range split. [#20704](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20704)
- Fixed an issue with the formatting of unicode values in string arrays. [#20657](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20657)
- Fixed detection and proper handling of certain variations of network partitions using server-side RPC keepalive in addition to client-side RPC keepalive. [#20707](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20707)

- Dangling intents are now eagerly cleaned up when `AmbiguousResultErrors` are seen. [#20628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20628)
- Fixed the return type signature of the JSON `#>>` operator and `array_positions()` built-in function. [#20524](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20524)
- Fixed an issue where escaped characters like `\A` and `\\` in `LIKE`/`ILIKE` patterns were not handled properly. [#20600](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20600)
- Fixed an issue with `(NOT) (I)LIKE` pattern matching on `_...%` and `%..._` returning incorrect results. [#20600](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20600)
- Fixed a small spelling bug that made it such that a `DOUBLE PRECISION` specified type would erroneously display as a float. [#20727](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20727)
- Fixed a crash caused by null collated strings. [#20637](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/20637)
