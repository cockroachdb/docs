### SQL Language Changes

- CockroachDB now properly reports an error
  when a query attempts to use ORDER BY within a function argument list,
  which is an unsupported feature. [#25147][#25147]
- The binary postgres wire format is now supported for
  intervals. [#28135][#28135]

### Bug Fixes

- Fix bug that could skip the row following a deleted row during BACKUP. [#28196][#28196]
- Limit the size of "batch groups" when committing
  a batch to RocksDB to avoid rare scenarios in which multi-gigabyte batch
  groups are created which can cause a server to run out of memory when
  replaying the RocksDB log at startup. [#28009][#28009]
- Prevent unbounded growth of the raft log
  caused by a loss of quorum. [#27868][#27868]

### Performance Improvements

- Fix batch commit performance
  regression that reduced write performance by 20%. [#28009][#28009]

### Miscellaneous

#### Missing Category

- `\r\n` characters in CSV files were silently converted into `\n`. This
  causes imported data to be different. This is now fixed. [#28225][#28225]
