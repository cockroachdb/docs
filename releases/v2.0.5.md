### SQL language changes

- The binary Postgres wire format is now supported for [`INTERVAL`](../v2.0/interval.html) values. [#28135][#28135] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) no longer silently converts `\r\n` characters in CSV files into `\n`. [#28225][#28225]
- Fixed a bug that could cause the row following a deleted row to be skipped during [`BACKUP`](../v2.0/backup.html). [#28196][#28196]
- Limited the size of "batch groups" when committing a batch to RocksDB to avoid rare scenarios in which multi-gigabyte batch groups are created, which can cause a server to run out of memory when replaying the RocksDB log at startup. [#28009][#28009]
- Prevented unbounded growth of the Raft log caused by a loss of quorum. [#27868][#27868]
- CockroachDB now properly reports an error when a query attempts to use `ORDER BY` within a function argument list,
  which is an unsupported feature. [#25147][#25147]

### Doc updates

- Added a [Performance Tuning tutorial](../v2.0/performance-tuning.html) that demonstrates essential techniques for getting fast reads and writes in CockroachDB, starting with a single-region deployment and expanding into multiple regions. [#3378][#3378]
- Expanded the [Production Checklist](../v2.0/recommended-production-settings.html#networking) to cover a detailed explanation of network flags and scenarios and updated [production deployment tutorials](../v2.0/manual-deployment.html) to encourage the use of `--advertise-host` on node start. [#3352][#3352]
- Expanded the [Kubernetes tutorials](../v2.0/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) to include setting up monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Alertmanager. [#3370][#3370]
- Updated the [OpenSSL certificate tutorial](../v2.0/create-security-certificates-openssl.html) to allow multiple node certificates with the same subject. [#3423][#3423]
