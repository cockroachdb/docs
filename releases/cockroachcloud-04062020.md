### Security updates

CockroachCloud now requires a user to have a CockroachCloud account before accepting an invite to join an Organization.

### General changes

- CockroachCloud users who are not a member of an existing Organization can now create an Organization when they log into the CockroachCloud Console.

### Doc updates

- Documented the [upgrade policy](../v20.1/cockroachcloud-upgrade-policy.html) for CockroachDB upgrades for CockroachCloud clusters.
