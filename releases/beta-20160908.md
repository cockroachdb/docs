### General Changes

- CockroachDB has reverted to RocksDB 4.8. [#9118](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9118)
- The logging format has changed to include a goroutine ID. [#8977](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8977)
- CockroachDB now builds correctly when Git worktrees are used; as a consequence Git version 2.5 or newer is now required when [building from source](../v1.0/install-cockroachdb.html). [#9072](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9072)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- The `--from` and `--to` arguments of debugging commands now support backslash-escaped keys. [#8903](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8903)
- If any [environment variables](../v1.0/cockroach-commands.html#environment-variables) are used to configure the server, the names of those variables are printed to the logs. [#9069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9069)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that would result in the server locking up after a few hours on a machine or VM with only one CPU. [#8908](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8908)
- Fixed another cause of persistently broken connections on node restarts. [#8947](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8947)
- [`CREATE TABLE`](../v1.0/create-table.html) now reports errors correctly instead of failing silently. [#9011](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9011)
- The replica garbage collection process is no longer confused by uninitialized replicas. [#9021](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9021)
- Fixed various data races. [#8865](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8865), [#8933](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8933)
- Fixed a panic in the time-series query system. [#9038](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9038)

### Performance Improvements

- Internal locking mechanisms have been refactored to improve parallelism. [#8941](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8941)
- GRPC request tracing has been disabled due to its memory cost. [#9113](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9113)
- Raft leadership is more reliably transferred to coincide with the range lease. [#8932](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8932)
- Raft snapshots are now limited to one at a time on both the receiving and sending nodes. [#8974](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/8974)
- Node startup time has been improved. [#9020](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9020)
- Reduced memory usage of the timestamp cache. [#9102](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9102)
- Old replicas are now garbage-collected with higher priority. [#9019](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9019)
- Transaction records for splits and replica changes are now garbage-collected sooner. [#9036](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9036)

### Doc Updates

- Added docs on [deploying CockroachDB on Google Cloud Platform GCE](../v1.0/deploy-cockroachdb-on-google-cloud-platform.html). [#574](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/574)
- Added docs on [orchestrating CockroachDB with Kubernetes](../v1.0/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html). [#584](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/584)
- Updated [troubleshooting](../v1.0/troubleshoot.html) docs to cover cases when nodes won't join a cluster. [#610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/610) 
- Each version's release notes now link to the corresponding Mac and Linux binaries. [#604](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/604)
- Updated docs on [secure local](../v1.0/secure-a-cluster.html) and [secure distributed](../v1.0/manual-deployment.html) deployment to show how to stop nodes. [#619](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/619)
