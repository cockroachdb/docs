~~~

### Enterprise edition changes

- The `WITH avro_schema_prefix` option for Avro [changefeeds](../v21.1/create-changefeed.html) now sets `schema.namespace` [#61734][#61734] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now fails fast when [Change Data Capture](../v21.1/change-data-capture.html) writes are blocked. [#62756][#62756] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

#### Multi-region SQL changes

- Users can now use a multi-region [`ALTER DATABASE`](../v21.1/alter-database.html) command if:

    - The user is an [`admin`](../v21.1/authorization.html#admin-role) user
    - The user is the owner of the database.
    - The user has [`CREATE`](../v21.1/authorization.html#privileges) privileges on the database. [#62528][#62528] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Availability zones are now ordered when using the `SHOW REGIONS` set of commands. [#62619][#62619] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

#### General SQL changes

- Added the `stub_catalog_tables` [session variable](../v21.1/set-vars.html), which is enabled by default. If disabled, querying an unimplemented [`pg_catalog`](../v21.1/pg-catalog.html) table will result in an error, as is the case in v20.2 and earlier. Otherwise, the query will simply return no rows. [#62621][#62621] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### DB Console changes

-  The [**Statements** page](../v21.1/ui-statements-page.html) now shows internal statements when the *all* filter option is selected. [#62677][#62677] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that in rare circumstances could cause an implicitly committed (`STAGING`) transaction to be uncommitted if any unresolved intents were removed by a range clear (e.g. when cleaning up a dropped table). This bug fix is only effective with separated intents, which are disabled by default. [#62376][#62376]
- Added a `DuplicateObject` error code for when a user attempts to `ADD REGION` to a database where the region already exists. [#62491][#62491]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur during planning for queries involving tables with many columns and at least one [inverted index](../v21.1/inverted-indexes.html). The error, "estimated distinct count must be non-zero", was caused by an invalid pointer access in the cardinality estimation code. This has now been fixed. [#62545][#62545]
- Writing files to `userfile` would sometimes result in an error claiming that the `userfile` table already exists. This is now fixed. [#62544][#62544]
- When adding/dropping regions from a multi-region database, the user must now have privileges on all regional-by-row tables as these are implicitly re-partitioned under the hood. [#62612][#62612]
- Fixed an internal error caused by comparing collation names that had different upper/lower case characters. [#62637][#62637]
- Fixed a bug whereby [`ENUM`](../v21.1/enum.html) types which have large numbers of values would cause unexpected errors when attempting to read from tables with columns using that `ENUM` type. [#62210][#62210]
- Fixed a bug introduced in earlier v21.1 alpha releases which could cause panics when [dropping indexes](../v21.1/drop-index.html) on tables partitioned by [user-defined types](../v21.1/enum.html). [#62725][#62725]
- Fixed a bug from earlier v21.1 alpha releases whereby dropping an index on a table partitioned by a user-defined type and then [dropping the table](../v21.1/drop-table.html) and then [dropping the type](../v21.1/drop-type.html) before the GC TTL for the index has expired could result in a crash. [#62725][#62725]

### Performance improvements

- Improved the performance of the [vectorized engine](../v21.1/vectorized-execution.html) when scanning fewer than 1024 rows at a time. [#62365][#62365]
- Improved logic in determining the configuration for data to avoid expensive work when there are a large number of [user-defined schemas](../v21.1/create-schema.html). [#62577][#62577]
- Addressed a performance regression from a past change regarding read-triggered compactions. [#62676][#62676]
