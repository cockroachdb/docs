### Upgrade Procedure

- This release cannot be run concurrently with older beta releases. Please stop all nodes running older releases before restarting any node with this version.

### New Features

- The [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statement now accepts an `ON CONFLICT` clause, for a more flexible alternative to `UPSERT`. [#6591](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6591)
- The new [`EXPLAIN (TYPES)`](../v1.0/explain.html) subcommand prints information about the types of expressions in a statement. [#6482](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6482)
- Added the aggregate functions [`BOOL_AND()`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) and [`BOOL_OR()`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html). [#6535](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6535)
- The aggregate functions [`SUM(INT)`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) and [`AVG(INT)`](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) now return `DECIMAL` instead of `INT` and `FLOAT` respectively. [#6532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6532)
- The new command-line flag [`--raft-tick-interval`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) allows the raft heartbeat frequency to be changed in high-latency deployments. [#6615](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6615)
- [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html) values can now be cast to type `STRING`. [#6605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6605)
- The [`CREATE DATABASE`](../v1.0/create-database.html) statement now accepts an `ENCODING` option for compatibility with PostgreSQL, although `UTF8` is the only supported encoding. [#6614](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6614)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug when a single [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html) statement inserts multiple values for the same primary key. [#6564](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6564)
- Fixed an inconsistency that could occur when a transaction in [`SNAPSHOT` isolation](../v1.0/transactions.html#isolation-levels) used the internal `DeleteRange` operation. [#6548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6548)
- Fixed an integer underflow that could result in log messages like `transport: http2Server received 4294965918-bytes`. [#6567](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6567)
- Long-running transactions are no longer allowed to exceed their table descriptor lease. [#6418](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6418)
- Subtracting an `INTERVAL` from a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` returns a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` instead of one without a time zone. [#6540](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6540)
- Improved type checking of comparisons involving tuples. [#6517](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6517)
- [`CREATE TABLE`](../v1.0/create-table.html), [`ALTER TABLE`](../v1.0/alter-table.html), and [`DROP INDEX`](../v1.0/drop-index.html) now do more validation of their arguments. [#6492](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6492)

### Performance improvments

- Improved tracking of keys modified during a transaction, improving performance of bulk inserts. [#6611](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6611)
- Schema changes can now continue past transient errors. [#6552](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6552)

### Doc Updates

- The new [Tech Talks](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/community/tech-talks/) page links to recordings and slides from talks by CockroachDB founders and engineers.
- Docs for the [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now demonstrate various ways to execute SQL statements from the command line and run external commands from the interactive shell.
- [Data type](../v1.0/data-types.html) docs now provide details about storage size.
- Although it's not possible to access CockroachDB's key-value store directly, the [FAQ](../v1.0/frequently-asked-questions.html#can-i-use-cockroachdb-as-a-key-value-store) now suggests a SQL alternative.
- [Replication recommendations](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html#node-replica-recommendations) now address cross-datacenter scenarios.
