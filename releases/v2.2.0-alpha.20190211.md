toc: true
summary: Additions and changes in CockroachDB version v2.2.0-alpha.20190211 since version v2.2.0-alpha.20190114
---

## February 11, 2019

In addition to SQL language enhancements, general usability improvements, performance improvements, and bug fixes, this release includes several major highlights:

- [**Follower Reads**](../v19.1/follower-reads.html): Enterprise users can now reduce read latencies by allowing queries to perform historical reads of the closest replica of a given piece of data rather than reading from the more distant "leaseholder" replica. To enable follower reads on a query, use the `experimental_follower_read_timestamp()` [built-in function](../v19.1/functions-and-operators.html) in conjunction with the `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clause.  
- [**Cost-Based Optimizer**](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html): The cost-based optimizer now supports almost all read-only queries (except window functions) and almost all mutations (e.g., `CREATE TABLE AS`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `UPSERT`, `DELETE`). In addition, the cost-based optimizer now reorders up to 4 joins in a query to attempt to find the most performant ordering (via the new `experimental_reorder_joins_limit` [session variable](../v19.1/set-vars.html)) and takes advantage of automatic statistics without impacting foreground traffic. Note that statistics are created by default on all indexed columns when a user upgrades to this version. Finally, a query plan cache now saves a portion of the planning time for frequent queries used in the cost-based optimizer.
- [**Change Data Capture**](../v19.1/change-data-capture.html): Enterprise users can now create `CHANGEFEED`s that deliver table updates as JSON files to cloud storage endpoints like Google Storage or AWS S3. In addition, all CockroachDB users can now use the core implementation of change data capture, via the new `EXPERIMENTAL CHANGEFEED FOR` statement, to consumes table updates over a streaming Postgres connection. Finally, all `CHANGEFEEDS` now default to using a new "push" mechanism called _rangefeeds_ to deliver data with increased reliability and lower latency.

~~~

### Backward-incompatible changes

- The [`CHANGEFEED`](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) `experimental_avro` format is now backward- and forward-compatible with adjacent schemas for the same table. [#34095][#34095] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### General changes

- [Go 1.11.4](https://golang.org/dl/) is now the minimum required version necessary to build CockroachDB. [#33668][#33668] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Increased the maximum length of queries in crash reports, to make debugging easier. [#34479][#34479]

### Enterprise edition changes

- [`CHANGEFEED`](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html)s now experimentally support writing to cloud storage, for easy use with analytics databases. [#33647][#33647] [#34193][#34193]
- The `CHANGEFEED` `envelope=row` option is now deprecated and will be removed in the Fall 2019 release. The default envelope for new changefeeds is now `wrapped`. [#34309][#34309] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `CHANGEFEED`s now operate on an end-to-end "push" model, reducing latency of row changes. Some workloads will also see fewer transaction restarts on tables being watched by `CHANGEFEED`s. [#34457][#34457] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for standard HTTP proxy environment variables in HTTP and S3 storage. [#34067][#34067]
- Added support for performing sufficiently old historical reads against the closest replicas rather than leaseholders as well as a new `experimental_follower_read_timestamp()` [built-in function](../v19.1/functions-and-operators.html), which can be used with [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v19.1/as-of-system-time.html) clauses to generate a timestamp that is likely to be safe for reads from a follower. [#33478][#33478] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- [`VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`](../v19.1/validate-constraint.html) is now compatible with the new `MATCH FULL` and `MATCH SIMPLE` foreign key semantics and is more performant. [#34365][#34365] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Table data is now validated against a newly added [`CHECK`](../v19.1/check.html) constraint asynchronously after the transaction commits. [#32504][#32504] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `NULL` values are now supported in int and text arrays in the driver protocol. [#33675][#33675]
- CockroachDB now supports transmitting bit array values using the decimal encoding in the low-level client protocol. [#34050][#34050]
- It is now possible to force a reverse scan of a specific index using `table@{FORCE_INDEX=index,DESC}`. [#34075][#34075] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Improved the output of [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.1/explain.html) for `index-join` and `lookup-join`. [#34138][#34138] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `FILTER` expressions are now supported by the cost-based optimizer. [#34077][#34077] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`EXPLAIN (OPT)`](../v19.1/explain.html) now has a much shorter output. `EXPLAIN (OPT,VERBOSE)` and `EXPLAIN (OPT,TYPES)` can be used for more verbose output. [#34128][#34128] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Using a sequence as a [`SELECT`](../v19.1/select-clause.html) target is now supported by the cost-based optimizer. [#33196][#33196] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Removed the `2.0-off` and `2.0-auto` modes for the `sql.defaults.distsql` [cluster setting](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html). All queries are now run via the newer, distributed SQL engine; queries are still only distributed if appropriate. [#34163][#34163] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `experimental_force_lookup_join` [session variable](../v19.1/set-vars.html) has been removed. [#34142][#34142] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `experimental_reorder_joins_limit` [session variable](../v19.1/set-vars.html), which defaults to `4` and causes the cost-based optimizer to reorder up to 4 joins in a query to attempt to find the most performant ordering. This behavior can be disabled per-session by setting the `experimental_reorder_joins_limit` session variable to 0. [#34549][#34549] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Formatting of timestamps as JSON strings has been changed to always use the RFC3339 format instead of Cockroach's customary format. Users can now expect to see a `T` separator instead of a space between the date and time components. [#34412][#34412] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Introduced a new top-level statement for an experimental version of [`CHANGEFEED`](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) that doesn't require an enterprise license and that returns results as a stream over the sql connection. [#34386][#34386] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The result buffer size can now be controlled on a per-connection basis with the `results_buffer_size` connection string parameter. [#34385][#34385] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v19.1/create-statistics.html) now runs as a job instead of as a regular SQL statement. [#34279][#34279] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`INT`](../v19.1/int.html) values are now stored with microsecond precision instead of nanoseconds. Existing intervals with nanoseconds are no longer able to return their nanosecond part. An existing table `t` with nanoseconds in intervals of column `s` can round them to the nearest microsecond with `UPDATE t SET s = s + '0s'`. Note that this could potentially cause uniqueness problems if the interval is a primary key. [#34202][#34202] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v19.1/as-of-system-time.html) clauses in [`BEGIN TRANSACTION`](../v19.1/begin-transaction.html) and [`SET TRANSACTION`](../v19.1/set-transaction.html) statements, which enables entire read-only transactions to be run against a historical timestamp. This functionality simplifies performing complex analytics against a consistent snapshot of historical data and eases the burden to use historical reads with ORMs which generally make modifying the syntax of generated `SELECT` statements difficult. [#34305][#34305] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The behavior of the `now()` [built-in function](../v19.1/functions-and-operators.html) inside of historical `SELECT ... AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries now reflects the historical timestamp at which the query is being run rather than the current clock time when the statement is executed. [#34305][#34305] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `ORDER BY` clause can no longer be used with a `DELETE` statement when there is no `LIMIT` clause present. Sorting the output should instead be done using `SELECT ... FROM [DELETE ...] ORDER BY ...`. [#34303][#34303] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Enabled automatic statistics collection. [#34529][#34529] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`DELETE`](../v19.1/delete.html), [`UPDATE`](../v19.1/update.html), and [`UPSERT`](../v19.1/upsert.html) statements are now planned by the cost-based optimizer. [#34522][#34522] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The value of `information_schema.columns.character_maximum_column` is set to `NULL` for all integer types, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#34182][#34182] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Command-line changes

- The modified time is now set for entries in [`cockroach debug zip`](../v19.1/debug-zip.html) output. [#33714][#33714] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Clarified the informational message printed upon running `cockroach start --join`. [#33435][#33435]

### Admin UI changes

- Added a debug endpoint listing the hottest ranges by QPS on each node/store. [#33336][#33336] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Improved performance of graph detail tooltips when viewing long timespans (e.g., 1 month) [#34032][#34032]
- [`CHANGEFEED`](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) metrics are now exposed in the UI. [#34427][#34427] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in [`RESTORE`](../v19.1/restore.html) that prevented restoring some [`BACKUP`](../v19.1/backup.html)s containing previously dropped or truncated interleaved tables. [#34413][#34413]
- Fixed a bug in [`cockroach node status`](../v19.1/view-node-details.html) that prevented it from displaying down nodes in the cluster in some circumstances. [#34448][#34448]
- Fixed several related panics in the optimizer related to plan exploration. [#34667][#34667]
- Resolved a cluster degradation scenario that could occur during [`IMPORT`](../v19.1/import.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v19.1/restore.html) operations, manifested through a high number of pending Raft snapshots. [#33582][#33582]
- Fixed a bug where some comparison operations with constant inputs were not getting folded during query optimization, causing the optimizer to produce sub-optimal plans. [#33597][#33597]
- [Window functions](../v19.1/window-functions.html) with non-empty `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are now handled correctly when invoked via the low-level client protocol. [#33591][#33591]
- Fixed a memory leak around `DEALLOCATE` and `DISCARD` statements that could result in panics with the `unexpected <amount> leftover bytes` message. [#33423][#33423]
- Lookup joins now properly preserve their input order even if more than one row of the input corresponds to the same row of the lookup table. [#33536][#33536]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when performing an [`INSERT ON CONFLICT`](../v19.1/insert.html) with a `SET UPDATE` that uses values from a subquery. [#33553][#33553]
- Preparing queries with missing placeholders (e.g., `SELECT $2::int`) now results in an error. [#33716][#33716]
- Fixed a goroutine leak that would occur while a cluster was unavailable (or a subset of nodes partitioned away from the cluster) and would cause a resource spike to resolve. [#33282][#33282]
- Fixed panics or incorrect results in some cases when grouping on constant columns (either with `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT ON`). [#34123][#34123]
- Prevented down-replicating widely replicated ranges when nodes in the cluster are temporarily down. [#34126][#34126]
- Fixed a panic when an internal implementation error prevents proper handling of placeholders (query parameters). [#34134][#34134]
- CockroachDB now enables re-starting a node at an address previously allocated for another node. [#34155][#34155]
- The values reported in `information_schema.columns` for integer columns created prior to CockroachDB v2.1 as `BIT` are now fixed and consistent with other integer types. [#34182][#34182]
- CockroachDB 2.2-alpha releases can once again be built from source on FreeBSD (unsupported platform). [#34244][#34244]
- Fixed a back up in flow creation observed by "no inbound stream connection" caused by not releasing a lock before attempting a possibly blocking operation. [#34218][#34218]
- [`CHANGEFEED`](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html)s now can be started on tables that have been backfilled by schema changes. [#34317][#34317]
- Fixed a possible panic in `crdb_internal.pretty_key()`. [#34480][#34480]
- `CHANGEFEED`s with `changefeed.push.enabled` set to `true` now resolve timestamps in the presence of inactive ranges. [#34550][#34550]
- Fixed a panic when updating a job that doesn't exist. [#34574][#34574]
- Fixed a panic due to incorrect statistics calculations when all values of a column are NULL. [#34578][#34578]
- Fixed a bug where lease transfers passed through Snapshots could forget to update in-memory state on the new leaseholder, allowing write-skew between read-modify-write operations. [#34548][#34548]

### Performance improvements

- Reduced the network and storage overhead of multi-range transactions. [#33566][#33566]
- A query plan cache now saves a portion of the planning time for frequent queries. [#34454][#34454]
- Transaction record garbage collection requests are now batched on a per range basis to reduce the number of Raft entries in a high-throughput, write-heavy, transactional workload. [#34242][#34242]

### Doc updates

- The new [Life of a Distributed Transaction](../v2.1/architecture/life-of-a-distributed-transaction.html) details the path that a query takes through CockroachDB's architecture, starting with a SQL client and progressing all the way to RocksDB (and then back out again). [#4281](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4281)
- Added a [warning about cross-store rebalancing](../v19.1/start-a-node.html#store) not working as expected in 3-node clusters with multiple stores per node. [#4320](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4320)
- Updated the [`INT`](../v19.1/int.html) documentation to include examples of actual min/max integers supported by each type for easier reference. Also added a description of possible compatibility issues caused by 64-bit integers vs., for example, JavaScript runtimes. [#4317](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4317)
- Documented the `sql.metrics.statement_details.plan_collection.period` [cluster setting](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html), which controls how often the logical plan for a fingerprint is sampled (5 minutes by default) on the [**Statements**](../v19.1/admin-ui-statements-page.html) page of the Admin UI. [#4316](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4316)
- Added guidance on [removing `UNIQUE` constraints](../v19.1/constraints.html#remove-constraints). [#4276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4276)
- Added a note that when a table that was previously [split](../v19.1/split-at.html) is truncated, the table must be pre-split again. [#4274](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4274)
- Updated the [SQL Performance Best Practices](../v19.1/performance-best-practices-overview.html#interleave-tables) with caveats around interleaving tables. [#4273](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4273)
