### Upgrade Notes

- This release cannot be run concurrently with older beta releases. Please stop all nodes running older releases before restarting any node with this version.

### SQL Language Changes

- The `ALTER TABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` statement can now be used to validate foreign keys in the `UNVALIDATED` state. [#12682](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12682)
- [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](../v1.0/drop-column.html) can now drop columns that are involved in indexes. If the index includes columns other than the one being dropped, the `CASCADE` modifier is required. [#12782](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12782)
- Leading zeros in numeric literals are now ignored instead of causing the number to be parsed as octal. [#12803](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12803)
- Collated strings can now be cast to the non-collated string type. [#12820](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12820)
- Arithmetic with [aggregated functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) no longer crashes when the input table is empty. [#12733](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12733)
- The [`SHOW COLUMNS`](../v1.0/show-columns.html) statement now works for non-root users with the appropriate permissions. [#12776](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12776)
- The `information_schema.statistics.NON_UNIQUE` field is now set correctly. [#12793](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12793)
- It is now possible to use `EXPLAIN` statements as an input to other queries using a new square bracket syntax: `SELECT MAX(level) FROM [EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM kv ORDER BY v]`. [#12637](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12637)
- The format of SQL error messages has been standardized. [#12401](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12401)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- The prototype `cockroach backup` and `cockroach restore` commands have been removed (backup and restore functionality will be provided through SQL statements instead). [#12788](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12788)

### Admin UI Changes

- The set of graphs displayed in the UI has been changed. [#12797](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12797)
- The node list and cluster pages has been updated. [#12643](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12643) [#12719](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12719)
- A new metric `raftlog.behind` is now reported to track how far behind raft processing is on a node. [#12800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12800)

### Bug Fixes

- Ranges can no longer be rebalanced away from their current lease holder. [#12598](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12598)
- Eliminated a source of incorrect "not lease holder" errors. [#12542](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12542)
- Reduced spammy "purgatory" log messages. [#12528](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12528)

### Performance Improvements

- The maximum allowable clock offset has been increased from 250ms to 500ms. [#12821](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12821)
- Replica destruction is now much faster. [#12745](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12745)
- Raft snapshots and replica destruction no longer run concurrently. [#12737](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12737)
- Raft snapshots are now managed by a new internal queue. [#12686](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12686)
- Raft logs are now garbage collected more aggressively. [#12686](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12686)
- Replicas that are behind are no longer considered targets for lease rebalancing. [#12736](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12736)
- Tuned some RocksDB parameters. [#12677](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/12677)
