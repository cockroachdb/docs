### General changes

- The default disk size on Kubernetes has been changed from 1 GiB to 100 GiB. [#32428][#32428] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- A new cluster setting (`sql.defaults.conn_results_buffer_size`) can be used to control server-side buffering of results. [#32366][#32366] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Enterprise edition changes

- Disabled range merges on tables that are being restored or imported into. [#32538][#32538]
- Added timeseries metrics for debugging `CHANGEFEED` performance issues. [#32241][#32241] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the option to supply Google Cloud Storage credentials on a per-statement basis with the query parameter `credentials`. [#32544][#32544] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is now possible to use AWS S3 temporary credentials for `BACKUP`/`RESTORE` and `IMPORT`/`EXPORT` using the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` parameter in the URL. [#32455][#32455] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- Users can customize the auto-retry savepoint name used by the `SAVEPOINT` command by setting the `force_savepoint_restart` session variable. For example, `SET force_savepoint_restart=true; BEGIN; SAVEPOINT foo` will now function as desired. This session variable may also be supplied as part of a connection string to support existing code that assumes that arbitrary savepoint names may be used. [#31971][#31971] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The names supplied to a `SAVEPOINT` command are now properly treated as SQL identifiers.  For example, `SAVEPOINT foo` and `SAVEPOINT FOO` are now equivalent statements. [#31971][#31971] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is now an error to run `ALTER TABLE ... DROP STORED` on a column which is not actually a computed, stored column. Previously, this statement would be a successful no-op. [#32279][#32279]
- Many queries containing a correlated `EXISTS` subquery with a generator function can now be decorrelated and executed successfully. Previously, these queries caused a decorrelation error. [#31922][#31922]
- `IMPORT` now uses larger integer sizes when converting unsigned MySQL integer columns to their signed cockroach counterparts. [#32481][#32481]
- An `ALTER TABLE` statement to add a foreign key constraint now automatically creates the necessary index if the referencing table is empty and the index does not already exist. [#32234][#32234] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Queries involving `COLLATE` expressions are now supported by the cost-based optimizer. [#32500][#32500] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Some categories of `SELECT` queries that return 0 or 1 rows (namely, queries by a PK, a unique index, or LIMIT 1 queries) are now guaranteed to not return retryable errors when running as implicit transactions (i.e., outside of a `BEGIN...COMMIT` block). [#32401][#32401] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` with the `CREATE STATISTICS` statement. [#32643][#32643] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now accepts ordinary string values for placeholders of type `BPCHAR`, for compatibility with PostgreSQL clients that use them. [#32654][#32654]
- CockroachDB now supports associating comments to SQL tables using PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON TABLE` syntax. This also provides proper support for pg's `pg_catalog.pg_description` and built-in function `obj_description()`. [#32442][#32442] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `SHOW TABLES` statement now supports printing out table comments using the optional phrase `WITH COMMENT`, e.g `SHOW TABLES FROM mydb WITH COMMENT`. [#32442][#32442] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `INT` type is now treated as an alias for `INT8`. [#32831][#32831] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added an `experimental_optimize_updates` flag, which uses the cost-based optimizer to plan `UPDATE` statements when set to true. [#32774][#32774] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Command-line changes

- `cockroach sql` and other commands that print query results and query execution latency will now exclude the time required to prepare the display client-side from the latency measurement. [#32663][#32663] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `cockroach workload` now includes the `kv` and `ycsb` generators. [#32719][#32719] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `cockroach debug merge-logs` command to combine logs from multiple nodes. [#32790][#32790] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Admin UI changes

- All existing uses of the Loading component now properly surface data errors. Previously, data errors weren't consistently surfaced. [#32464][#32464]
- The Node map now uses an `equirectangular` projection. [#32617][#32617]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a panic on `UPDATE RETURNING *` during a schema change. [#32188][#32188]
- Fixed a panic when expression contains both a correlated and uncorrelated subquery. [#32443][#32443]
- Fixed a panic on `UPSERT` in the middle of a schema change adding a non-nullable column. [#32585][#32585]
- Fixed an error when configuring `NOT NULL` computed columns. [#32585][#32585]
- Fixed a deadlock when using `ALTER TABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` in a transaction with a schema change. [#32772][#32772]
- Prevented non-superusers from seeing other user's sessions and queries via the `ListSessions` and `ListLocalSessions` status server API methods. [#32253][#32253]
- Avoided occasional unnecessary Raft snapshots after range splits. [#31875][#31875]
- `CHANGEFEED`s emitting into Kafka now more quickly notice new partitions. [#32297][#32297]
- Ensured that space in the temporary storage directory is reclaimed more promptly. [#32385][#32385]
- `CHANGEFEED`s with the `experimental_avro` option now work with column `WIDTH`s and `PRECISION`s. [#32474][#32474] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now properly rejects queries that use an invalid function (e.g., an aggregation) in the `SET` clause of an `UPDATE` statement. [#32505][#32505]
- Prevented `VALUES` clauses from returning incorrect results for certain special OID values. [#32494][#32494]
- CockroachDB now reports an unimplemented error when a `WHERE` clause is used after `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`. [#32556][#32556]
- Fixed an issue where calling `CREATE STATISTICS` on a large table could cause the server to crash due to running out of memory. [#32614][#32614]
- CockroachDB now properly handles foreign key cascading actions `SET DEFAULT` and `SET NULL` in `SHOW CREATE` and `cockroach dump`. [#32589][#32589]
- Fixed a node data loss bug that occurs when a disk becomes temporarily full. [#32605][#32605]
- Fixed a panic caused by `WITH ORDINALITY` in some cases. [#32596][#32596]
- Dates no longer have a time component in their text encoding over the wire. [#32144][#32144]
- Intervals now match Postgres in their text encoding over the wire. [#32144][#32144]
- Intervals no longer sometimes lose 1ns of precision. This only happened rarely due to floating point inaccuracy. [#32144][#32144]
- Corrected the `pgwire` encoding for arrays and tuples. [#32144][#32144]
- Corrected the binary decimal encoding for `NaN`. [#32144][#32144]
- Prevented a panic when running certain subqueries that get planned in a distributed fashion. [#32652][#32652]
- Fixed a panic that could occur during or after a data import on Windows. [#32664][#32664]
- Lookup joins now properly preserve ordering for outer joins. Prior to this fix, `LEFT JOIN` queries under specific conditions could produce results which did not respect the `ORDER BY` clause. [#32317][#32317]
- CockroachDB now again enables admin users, including `root`, to list all user sessions besides their own. [#32629][#32629]
- Fixed a panic involving `json_agg` and window functions. [#32716][#32716]
- CockroachDB no longer panics when encountering an internal error related to invalid entries in the output of `SHOW SESSION`s. [#32713][#32713]
- Resolved a cluster degradation scenario that could occur during `IMPORT`/`RESTORE` operations, manifested through a high number of pending Raft snapshots. [#32594][#32594]
- CockroachDB now properly evaluates `CHECK` constraints after a row conflict in `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` when the `CHECK` constraint depends on a column not assigned by `DO UPDATE SET`. [#32779][#32779]
- CockroachDB now properly records statistics for sessions where the value of `application_name` is given by the client during initialization instead of `SET`. [#32754][#32754]
- `cockroach workload run` no longer includes data-only generators [#32720][#32720]
- Fixed a bug where metadata about contended keys was inadvertently ignored, allowing for a failure in transaction cycle detection and transaction deadlocks in rare cases. [#32773][#32773]
- Fixed a bug where `SCRUB` would erroneously report that index keys were out of order. [#32908][#32908]

### Performance improvements

- Removed locking when reading physical time. [#32225][#32225]
- CockroachDB now users a faster randomness source to generate transaction IDs. [#32238][#32238]
- Implemented more efficient execution for some queries with `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT ON` and an `ORDER BY` clause where an index with a suitable ordering is not available. [#32307][#32307]
- CockroachDB now rewrites the Raft entry cache to optimize for access patterns, reduce lock contention, and reduce memory footprint. [#32618][#32618]
- Re-enabled usage of RocksDB FlushWAL, which is a minor performance improvement for synchronous RocksDB write operations. [#32674][#32674]
- Replaced the Replica latching mechanism with a new optimized data structure that improves throughput, especially under heavy contention. [#32865][#32865]

### Build changes

- `ncurses` is now linked statically so that the cockroach binary no longer requires a particular version of the `ncurses` shared library to be available on deployment machines. [#32959][#32959]

### Doc updates

- Updated the [Performance Tuning](../v19.1/performance-tuning.html) and [TPC-C Benchmarking](../v19.1/performance-benchmarking-with-tpc-c.html) tutorials to clarify that the `--advertise-addr` flag must be set uniquely for each node. [#4164](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4164)
- Fixed a method in the [Build a C# (.NET) App with CockroachDB](../v19.1/build-a-csharp-app-with-cockroachdb.html) code samples. [#4161](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4161)
- Expanded the [Build a Rust App with CockroachDB](../v19.1/build-a-rust-app-with-cockroachdb.html) tutorial to cover secure clusters. [#4127](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4127)
