### General changes

- Go 1.12.10 is now required to build CockroachDB from source. [#41647][#41647] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Named ports in URLs are no longer supported due to a [URL parsing security fix in Go 1.12.8](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3226f2d492963d361af9dfc6714ef141ba606713). Use port numbers instead. [#41647][#41647] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- Mutations under [`UNION` or `UNION ALL`](../v19.2/selection-queries.html#union-combine-two-queries) are once again supported. [#41500][#41500] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added new `skip` and `nullif` options for [`IMPORT ... DELIMITED DATA`](../v19.2/import.html), which ignore the specified number of lines at the beginning of the file and force all empty string fields to be inserted as `NULL` in the imported table, respectively. [#41656][#41656] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- It is no longer possible to use [`IMPORT INTO`](../v19.2/import-into.html) with an [interleaved table](../v19.2/interleave-in-parent.html). This restriction is temporary and will be lifted in a future release. [#41651][#41651] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`IMPORT`](../v19.2/import.html) is no longer allowed during a [rolling upgrade](../v19.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html). [#41733][#41733] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- Fixed multiple bugs relating to `COPY FROM PARENT` in [replication zones](../v19.2/configure-replication-zones.html). [#41677][#41677]
- The `system.replication_stats` table no longer incorrectly shows some ranges belonging to [table partitions](../v19.2/partitioning.html) as over-replicated. [#41700][#41700]
- Fixed a bug that resulted in some queries returning an "index join must be against primary index" error. [#41723][#41723]
- Fixed a bug where backfills could lead to certain [changefeed](../v19.2/change-data-capture.html) row updates never being emitted. [#41721][#41721]
- Fixed a bug that could cause [changefeed](../v19.2/change-data-capture.html) row updates to be emitted at a timestamp less than or equal to an already forwarded resolved timestamp. [#41714][#41714]
- Fixed a bug in cloud storage sink file naming for [changefeeds](../v19.2/change-data-capture.html) that could violate ordering in the presence of schema changes. [#41693][#41693]

### Performance improvements

- Increased [`BACKUP`](../v19.2/backup.html) parallelism in some cases. [#41729][#41729]
- Improved the performance of generating the `system.replication_*` tables for large clusters. [#41757][#41757]
- Improved performance of bulk ingestion. [#41768][#41768]

### Doc updates

- Clarified that to upgrade to the next major version [upgrade path for rolling upgrades](../v19.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html), a cluster must be on a production release of the previous version, as opposed to a testing release (alpha/beta). [#5644][#5644]
- Documented the experimental [`SHOW RANGE FOR ROW`](../v19.2/show-range-for-row.html) statement, which shows information about a range for a particular row of data. This information is useful for verifying how SQL data maps to underlying ranges, and where the replicas for a range are located. [#5612][#5612]
- Improved the usability of the tutorial on [deploying a Python To-Do app with Flask, Kubernetes, and CockroachCloud](../cockroachcloud/deploy-a-python-to-do-app-with-flask-kubernetes-and-cockroachcloud.html). [#5694][#5694]
- Updated [Helm-specific instructions](../v19.2/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) for Kubernetes version 1.16.0 and fixed various errors. [#5657][#5657], [#5659][#5659]
- Documented the [`FOR UPDATE` locking clause](../v19.2/postgresql-compatibility.html#locking-and-for-update), which is supported in [selection queries](../v19.2/selection-queries.html#parameters) for database migration compatibility. [#5658][#5658]
- Documented using `timezone()` and `AT TIME ZONE` functions to convert a `TIMESTAMPTZ` into a [`TIMESTAMP`](../v19.2/timestamp.html), or vice versa, in a specified timezone. [#5614][#5614]
- Clarified the required privileges for the [`CONFIGURE ZONE`](../v19.2/configure-zone.html) statement. [#5609][#5609]
