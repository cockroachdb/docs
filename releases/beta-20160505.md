### New Features

* New SQL command `UPSERT` is available. This is syntactically similar
  to `INSERT` but will update the row with the supplied columns if
  there is a conflicting row for the primary key.
  [#6456](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6456)
* The SQL type system has been overhauled, reducing the number of
  explicit casts required.
  [RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20160203_typing.md)
* Tuples are now considered for index selection, so `SELECT * FROM t
  WHERE (a, b) > ($1, $2)` can use an index defined on `(a, b)`.
  [#6332](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6332)

### Performance improvements

* Bulk inserts to previously-empty table spans are now faster.
  [#6375](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6375),
  [#6414](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6414)
* Ranges that have grown above the target size are now split before
  being rebalanced, reducing memory usage.
  [#6447](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6447)
* Reduced rapid memory growth during partitions.
  [#6448](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6448)
* [`ALTER TABLE`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) now performs backfill operations in chunks.
  [#6056](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6056)
* [`DROP TABLE`](../v1.0/drop-table.html) now uses the schema change mechanism intead of
  synchronously deleting all data.
  [#6336](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6336)
* Scanning over records that have only one MVCC version is faster.
  [#6351](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6351)
* The command queue now uses coarse-grained spans until a conflict has
  occurred.
  [#6412](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6412)
* When a replica is rebalanced from one node to another, the old node
  no longer triggers unnecessary Raft elections.
  [#6423](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6423)

### Production

* Servers now attempt to drain more gracefully when restarted.
  [#6313](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6313)
* Metrics on lease requests are now available internally.
  [#5596](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5596)
* The RocksDB cache will no longer use all available memory if
  `cgroups` reports a limit higher than physical memory.
  [#6379](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6379)

### Bug Fixes

* The range descriptor cache is now invalidated correctly, fixing a
  bug in which requests could be retried repeatedly on the wrong node.
  [#6425](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6425)
* Fixed a bug with some queries using aggregate functions like `MIN()`
  and `MAX()`. [#6380](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6380)
* Tuple comparisons now work correctly when one tuple contains `NULL`.
  [#6370](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6370)

### Doc Updates

* Community-supported docs and configuration files for [running CockroachDB inside a single VirtualBox virtual machine](http://uptimedba.github.io/cockroach-vb-single/cockroach-vb-single/home.html). [#263](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/263)
* Docs on using [environment variables](../v1.0/cockroach-commands.html#environment-variables) as default values for command-line flags. [#235](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/235)
* Docs on using the [`version`](../v1.0/view-version-details.html) and [`node`](../v1.0/view-node-details.html) commands.
