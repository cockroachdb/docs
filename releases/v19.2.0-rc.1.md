### SQL language changes

- `INTERVAL(6)` is now supported as an alias for [`INTERVAL`](../v19.2/interval.html), for compatibility with third-party tools. [#41447][#41447]
- Added the `pg_available_extensions` table, for compatibility with third-party tools. [#41447][#41447]
- The `pg_attrdef()` and `pg_get_indexdef()` [built-in functions](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html) no longer include type annotations on default expressions, and `pg_get_indexdef()` now includes the index method in the returned `CREATE INDEX` statement, for compatibility with third-party tools. [#41447][#41447]

### Bug fixes

- The `generate_subscripts()` [built-in function](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html) now behaves properly on `int2vector` and `oidvector` types. [#41447][#41447]
- Fixed a bug causing the `cluster_logical_timestamp()` [built-in function](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html) to sometimes return incorrect results. [#41439][#41439]
- Prevented an unlikely race condition where a WAL pending recycling could be deleted, leading to a crash. This bug was present in past 19.2 alphas/betas only, not in any earlier release. [#41523][#41523]

### Performance improvements

- Metadata queries that use the `'string'::regclass` form are now much more efficient in the presence of a large number of tables. [#41447][#41447]
- The `pg_get_coldesc()` [built-in function](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html) now retrieves comments more efficiently. [#41447][#41447]

### Doc updates

- Clarified epoch-based vs. expiration-based leases in the [Replication Layer](../v19.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#epoch-based-leases-table-data) architecture documentation. [#5578][#5578]
- Updated the list of [Enterprise features](../v19.2/enterprise-licensing.html). [#5599][#5599]
- Documented the new [`--geo-partitioned-replicas` flag of the `cockroach demo` command](../v19.2/cockroach-demo.html#start-a-multi-region-demo-cluster-with-automatic-geo-partitioning), which starts a 9-node in-memory cluster with the [Geo-Partitioned Replicas](../v19.2/topology-geo-partitioned-replicas.html) data topology applied to the `movr` database. This lets you quickly simulate one of the most effective data topology patterns for getting low latency in a multi-region cluster. [#5587][#5587]
