### Enterprise edition changes

- [Changefeeds](../v21.1/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) now reliably fail when [`IMPORT INTO`](../v21.1/import-into.html) is run against a targeted table, as change data capture is [not supported](../v21.1/known-limitations.html#change-data-capture) for this action. [#64372][#64372]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a correctness bug, which caused partitioned index scans to omit rows where the value of the first index column was `NULL`. This bug was present since v19.2.0. [#64046][#64046]
- [`IMPORT`](../v21.1/import.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v21.1/restore.html) jobs that were in progress during a cluster backup will now be canceled when that cluster backup is restored. This fixes a bug where these restored jobs may have assumed to make progress that was not captured in the backup. [#64352][#64352]
- Fixed a race condition where read-only requests during replica removal (for example, during range merges or rebalancing) could be evaluated on the removed replica, returning an empty result. [#64370][#64370]
- Fixed a bug where encryption-at-rest metadata was not synced and could become corrupted during a hard reset. [#64473][#64473]
