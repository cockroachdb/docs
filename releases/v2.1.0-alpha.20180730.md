## July 25, 2018

For our July 30th alpha release, in addition to PostgreSQL compatibility enhancements, general usability improvements, and bug fixes, we want to highlight some major benefits:

- [**Troubleshoot performance problems with hardware metrics**](../v2.1/admin-ui-hardware-dashboard.html) - The new Web UI **Hardware** dashboard provides more visibility into how cluster CPU, networking, disk, and memory resources are being utilized so you can quickly identify and remove performance bottlenecks.
- [**Easier PostgreSQL migration**](../v2.1/import-data.html) - We’ve made further enhancements to reduce PostgreSQL migration friction. Notable improvements include support for foreign keys, sequences, and `COPY` in `IMPORT ... PGDUMP`.
- [**Monitor Kubernetes-orchestrated clusters with Prometheus**](../v2.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) - We expanded our guides for running CockroachDB on Kubernetes in production to include setting up monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Alertmanager.

Please give these features and the ones below a try. If you see something that can be improved, we’d love to hear from you on [GitHub](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues) or the [Forum](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/).

### General changes

- The [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) is now on by default. [#26893][#26893]
- The time series system used by CockroachDB to store internal monitoring data now utilizes pre-computed rollups to significantly increase the duration for which monitoring data is available while using less storage. Monitoring data will be available for up to a year by default; however, data older than seven days will be stored at a reduced resolution, and thus will only be able to give details about 30 minute intervals. [#27121][#27121]
- Building CockroachDB from source now requires yarn at version 1.7.0 or above. [#27262][#27262]
- Added support for signing server and client certificates by different CAs. [#27636][#27636]

### Enterprise edition changes

- Core dumps are now disabled when [encryption](../v2.1/encryption.html) is enabled. [#27426][#27426]
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) now use an asynchronous Kafka producer, increasing throughput. [#27421][#27421]

### SQL language changes

- CockroachDB now supports custom frame specification for [window functions](../v2.1/window-functions.html) using `ROWS` (fully-supported) and `RANGE` modes. For `RANGE`, `<value> PRECEDING` and `<value> FOLLOWING` are not supported. [#26666][#26666]
- The `SNAPSHOT` [isolation level](../v2.1/transactions.html#isolation-levels) has been removed. Transactions that request to use it are now mapped to `SERIALIZABLE`. [#27040][#27040].
- When the cost-based optimizer is enabled, it will also affect prepared queries. [#27034][#27034]
- Upon failing to gather data from other nodes, the [`SHOW CLUSTER QUERIES`](../v2.1/show-queries.html) and [`SHOW CLUSTER SESSIONS`](../v2.1/show-sessions.html) statements now report the details of the error. [#26821][#26821]
- Improved the description for the `age()` [built-in function](../v2.1/functions-and-operators.html). [#27082][#27082]
- The `pg_get_indexdef()` built-in function now supports 3 arguments. [#27161][#27161]
- Added `COPY` support to `IMPORT .. . PGDUMP`. [#27062][#27062]
- The new `max_row_size` option overrides default limits on line size for `IMPORT ... PGDUMP` and `PGCOPY`. [#27062][#27062]
- The `SHOW TRACE FOR <stmt>` statement was incomplete and incorrect and has thus been removed. To turn on tracing, use `SET tracing = ...` and `SHOW SESSION TRACE`, or enable the new `auto_trace` client-side option for `cockroach sql`. [#26729][#26729] [#27805][#27805]
- `SET tracing` accepts a new option `results`, which causes result rows and row counts to be copied to the session trace. This was previously implicit with option `kv` but must now be specified explicitly when desired. [#26729][#26729]
- The word `view` is now supported as an identifier like in PostgreSQL. [#27204][#27204]
- `IMPORT ... PGDUMP` no longer requires the `--no-owner` flag. [#27268][#27268]
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` can now use some more complex expressions to compute the desired timestamp. [#27206][#27206]
- Added support for the `convert_from()` and `convert_to()` built-in functions, for compatibility with PostgreSQL.  For `convert_from()`, however, in contrast with PostgreSQL, the function in CockroachDB accepts NUL in the input, because null characters are valid in CockroachDB strings. [#27328][#27328]
- The `ALTER ... EXPERIMENTAL CONFIGURE ZONE` statement now accepts arbitrary scalar expressions (including possibly containing sub-queries) to compute the YAML operand. [#27213][#27213]
- CockroachDB now recognizes PostgreSQL's abbreviated time units when converting strings to intervals. [#27393][#27393]
- Sorting with a limit and/or input ordering now falls back to disk. [#27083][#27083]
- CockroachDB now reports a hint in the error message if it encounters a correlated query that it does not
  support yet. [#27396][#27396]
- The new `EXPERIMENTAL_RELOCATE LEASE` command for `ALTER TABLE` and `ALTER INDEX` allows manually transferring the leases for specific ranges to specific stores. [#26436][#26436]
- Added the `sql.distsql.flow_stream_timeout` and `sql.distsql.max_running_flows` [cluster settings](../v2.1/cluster-settings.html) to fine-tune flow setup [#27404][#27404]
- `IMPORT` now supports a `WITH oversample = ...` option to decrease variance in data distribution during processing. [#27341][#27341]
- `IMPORT ... PGDUMP` now supports foreign keys. [#27425][#27425]
- `IMPORT ... PGDUMP` now supports sequences. [#27739][#27739]
- `IMPORT ... PGDUMP` now supports empty and public schemas. [#27782][#27782]
- `SHOW JOBS` now reports results even when a job entry is incomplete or incorrect. [#27430][#27430]
- The column labels in the output of `EXPLAIN` and all `SHOW` statements have been renamed for consistency. [#27098][#27098]
- The column labels in the output of `SHOW COLUMNS` have been renamed for consistency with `information_schema`. The new `generation_expression` column reports the expression used for computed columns. [#27098][#27098]
- The `SHOW CREATE` statement has been simplified and can be used equivalently on tables, views, and sequences without having to specify the type of object to inspect. [#27098][#27098]
- Added the `chr()` built-in function (the inverse of `ascii()`). [#27278][#27278]
- Added support for skipping foreign keys in `IMPORT`s that support them. [#27606][#27606]
- The new `sql.optimizer.count` metric has been added to track the number of queries with the experimental
  cost-based optimizer. [#26981][#26981]
- More statement types are now reported in the collected statement statistics in the web UI and diagnostics reporting. [#27646][#27646]
- Added support for KV traces (`SHOW KV TRACE FOR SESSION`) on DistSQL-executed queries. [#27802][#27802]
- The return type of single-column generator functions has been changed from `tuple{columnType}` to `columnType`. This is a compatibility change to match the behavior of PostgreSQL. [#27773][#27773]

### Command-line changes

- CockroachDB now computes the correct number of replicas on down nodes. Therefore, when [decommissioning nodes](../v2.1/remove-nodes.html) via the [`cockroach node decommission`](../v2.0/view-node-details.html) command, the `--wait=all` option no longer hangs indefinitely when there are down nodes. As a result, the `--wait=live` option is no longer necessary and has been deprecated. The `--wait=all` option is now the default. [#27027][#27027]
- Added the `cockroach sqlfmt` command for formatting SQL statements. [#27240][#27240]
- The output labels of `cockroach user ls` and `cockroach user get` have been renamed for consistency with the SQL `SHOW USERS` statement. Also, to reduce inadvertent data leaks, the output of `cockroach user get` no longer includes hashed passwords. [#27098][#27098]
- The new client-side option `prompt1` can be used to customize the `cockroach sql` interactive prompt. [#27803][#27803]
- The new `auto_trace` client-side option can be use to turn on tracing for a `cockroach sql` session. [#27805][#27805]

### Web UI changes

- The new **Hardware** dashboard displays time series data about CPU, memory, and disk and network IO. [#27626][#27626]
- Time series metric metadata is now available at `<Web UI>/_admin/metricmetada`. [#25359][#25359]
- Encryption progress is now reported on `<Web UI>/#/reports/stores/local` debug page. [#26802][#26802]
- Statement statistics can now be filtered by app on the **Statements** page. [#26949][#26949] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Improved the readability of the mean and standard deviation bar chart on the **Statement Details** page. [#26949][#26949] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added a visualization of the standard deviation of the latency of statements to the **Statements** page. [#26949][#26949] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The **Statements** page now shows statements that executed on all nodes in the cluster, not just the gateway node. [#26605][#26605] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The **Statement Details** page now includes a table showing statistics broken down by which node was the gateway node. [#26605][#26605] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the ordering of columns in the [`cockroach node status`](../v2.1/view-node-details.html) output. [#27042][#27042]
- Fixed a bug that would make the **Statement Details** page in the Web UI break if a statement wasn't found. [#27105][#27105]
- Fixed some incorrectly typed columns in the `pg_index` virtual table. [#27723][#27723]
- Fixed permissions and audit logging issues with the optimizer. [#27108][#27108]
- Prevented a situation in which ranges repeatedly fail to perform a split. [#26934][#26934]
- Fixed a crash that could occur when distributed `LIMIT` queries were run on a cluster with at least one unhealthy node. [#26950][#26950]
- Failed [`IMPORT`s](../v2.1/import.html) now begin to clean up partially imported data immediately and in a faster manner. [#26959][#26959]
- `IMPORT` now detects node failure and will restart instead of fail. [#26881][#26881]
- Fixed a panic in the optimizer with `IN` filters. [#27053][#27053]
- Fixed a panic that could occur when renaming a scalar function used as a data source. [#27039][#27039]
- The server will not finalize a version upgrade automatically and erroneously if there are nodes temporarily inactive in the cluster. [#26821][#26821] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `DISTINCT ON` clause is now reported properly in statement statistics. [#27221][#27221]
- Fixed a panic in [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) when creating a table using a sequence operation (e.g., `nextval()`) in a column's [DEFAULT](../v2.0/default-value.html) expression.  [#27122][#27122]
- `SET` now properly rejects attempts to use
  invalid variable names starting with `tracing.`. [#27216][#27216]
- Fixed `NULL` equality handling in the experimental lookup join feature. [#27336][#27336]
- `ALTER ... EXPERIMENTAL CONFIGURE ZONE` is now properly tracked in statement statistics. [#27213][#27213]
- Invalid uses of set-generating functions in `FROM` clauses are now reported with the same error code as PostgreSQL. [#27390][#27390]
- The number of `COPY` columns is now correctly verified during `IMPORT ... PGDUMP`. [#27345][#27345]
- `CHANGFEED`s now correctly emit all versions of quickly changing rows. [#27612][#27612]
- Alleviated a scenario in which a large number of uncommitted Raft commands could cause memory pressure at startup time. [#27009][#27009]
- Prevented the unbounded growth of the Raft log caused by a loss of quorum. [#27774][#27774]
- Foreign key references in `IMPORT ... PGDUMP` are now processed in the correct order. [#27782][#27782]

### Performance improvements

- Transactional writes are now pipelined when being replicated and when being written to disk, dramatically reducing the latency of transactions that perform multiple writes. This can be disabled using the new `kv.transaction.write_pipelining_enabled` [cluster setting](../v2.1/cluster-settings.html). [#26599][#26599] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Reduced CPU utilization in clusters with many ranges, also during periods of lease rebalancing. [#26910][#26910] [#26907][#26907]
- Reduced the memory size of commonly used Request and Response objects. [#27112][#27112]
- Improved low-level iteration performance. [#27299][#27299]
- Prevented a scenario when dropping a table could cause excessive compaction activity that would degrade performance significantly. [#27353][#27353]
- Limited the scanner from running incessantly on stores with 100s of thousands of replicas. [#27441][#27441]
- Prevented dead nodes in clusters with many ranges from causing unnecessarily high CPU usage. [#26911][#26911]
- Significantly reduce CPU usage when a large number of ranges are deleted from a node. [#27520][#27520]
- Min, max, sum, and avg now take linear time when used for aggregation as window functions for all supported window frame options. [#26988][#26988]
- `CHANGEFEED`s no longer hold all data for each poll in memory at once, increasing scalability. [#27612][#27612] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Build changes

- Expanded the [Production Checklist](../v2.1/recommended-production-settings.html#networking) to cover a detailed explanation of network flags and scenarios and updated [production deployment tutorials](../v2.1/manual-deployment.html) to encourage the use of `--advertise-host` on node start. [#3352][#3352]
- Expanded the [Kubernetes tutorials](../v2.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) to include setting up monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Alertmanager. [#3370][#3370]
