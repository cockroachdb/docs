### Bug fixes

- Fixed help text that erroneously labeled [Encryption at Rest](../v19.1/encryption.html) as experimental. [#38237][#38237]
- Fixed an incorrect type mismatch error when empty [`ARRAY`](../v19.1/array.html) values are used as [`DEFAULT` values](../v19.1/default-value.html) (and potentially in other contexts). [#38300][#38300]
- Fixed a panic that could occur when decoding decimals as query parameters. [#38330][#38330]
- `NULL`s are now correctly handled by `MIN`, `SUM`, and `AVG` when used as [window functions](../v19.1/window-functions.html). [#38356][#38356]
- Fixed an issue that prevented [restoring](../v19.1/restore.html) some backups if they included tables that were partitioned by columns of a certain types while also interleaved by child tables. [#38494][#38494]
- Fixed possible deadlock when storage engine write fails. [#38478][#38478]
- Fixed potential reappearance of deleted timeseries data, which could trip the consistency checker. [#38478][#38478]
- Removed dependency on `sync_file_range` on Linux platforms on which it returns ENOSYS, such as WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). [#38478][#38478]
- Nodes that have been down now recover quicker when they rejoin, assuming they weren't down for much more than the value of the `server.time_until_store_dead` [cluster setting](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html) (which defaults to 5 minutes). [#38642][#38642]
- Checking the "skip should queue" checkbox in the Manual Enqueue Range advanced debuggging page now works for the GC Queue. [#38296][#38296]
- The YCSB workload no longer ignores the `--db `option. [#38238][#38238]
- Fixed the auto-retry counter in stats and now logs it in the statement/audit logs. [#38035][#38035]

### Security improvements

- Only check `CommonName` on first certificate in file. [#38165][#38165]

### Doc updates

- Added the [Build a Python app with Kubernetes on CockroachCloud](../cockroachcloud/deploy-a-python-to-do-app-with-flask-kubernetes-and-cockroachcloud.html) tutorial for running a Python app on a CockroachCloud cluster using a local Kubernetes cluster. [#4918](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4918)
- Expanded the recommended [Topology Patterns](../v19.1/cluster-topology-patterns.html) for running CockroachDB in a cloud environment, each with required configurations and latency and resiliency characteristics. [#4820](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4820)
- Made the Java code samples in [Build a Java App with CockroachDB](../v19.1/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html) simpler and more idiomatic. [#4855](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4855)
- Documented [what happens when a node runs out of disk space](../v19.1/operational-faqs.html#what-happens-when-a-node-runs-out-of-disk-space) and how to [create a ballast file](../v19.1/debug-ballast.html) to prepare for this case. [#5000](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5000)
