### Operational changes

- Added [logs](../v20.2/debug-and-error-logs.html) for important events during the [server draining/shutdown process](../v20.2/cockroach-quit.html). [#66882][#66882]  Specifically, the following:
    - Log when the server closes an existing connection while draining
    - Log when the server rejects a new connection while draining
    - Log when the server cancels in-flight queries after waiting for the duration of the `server.shutdown.query_wait` cluster setting to elapse while draining. 

### DB Console changes

- Fixed an issue with displaying more than 100 hours of remaining time on the [Jobs page](../v20.2/ui-jobs-page.html). [#66704][#66704]
- Removed width styling on the multi bar. [#66737][#66737]
- Fixed the [custom charts page](../v20.2/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html) layout. [#66623][#66623]
- Added a drag-to-select timescale feature to the [custom charts page](../v20.2/ui-custom-chart-debug-page.html). [#66623][#66623]
- Fixed a styling issue with a filter component on the [CockroachCloud console](../cockroachcloud/console-access-management.html). [#66566][#66566]
- Removed an unnecessary call to `console log`. [#66566][#66566]
- Bumped the `cluster-ui` version to v20.2.1. [#66566][#66566]
- Fixed a bug where [metrics pages in the DB Console](../v20.2/ui-overview-dashboard.html) would lose their scroll position on chart data updates. [#67088][#67088]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug which prevented the [optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) from producing plans with [partial indexes](../v21.1/partial-indexes.html) when executing some prepared statements that contained placeholders, stable functions, or casts. This bug was present since partial indexes were added in v20.2.0. [#66641][#66641]
- Fixed a panic that could occur in the [optimizer](../v21.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) when executing a prepared plan with placeholders. This could happen when one of the tables used by the query had [computed columns](../v21.1/computed-columns.html) or a [partial index](../v21.1/partial-indexes.html). [#66832][#66832]
- Fixed a bug that caused graceful drain to call `time.sleep` multiple times, which cut into the time needed for range [lease transfers](../v20.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases). [#66852][#66852]
- Allowed a node with [lease](../v20.2/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases) preferences to drain gracefully. [#66714][#66714]
- Avoid interacting with [decommissioned nodes](../v20.2/remove-nodes.html) during [DistSQL](../v20.2/architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql) planning and consistency checking. [#66951][#66951]
- [Changefeeds](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) no longer interact poorly with large, abandoned [transactions](../v20.2/transactions.html). It was previously possible for this combination to result in a cascade of work during transaction cleanup that could starve foreground traffic. [#66814][#66814]
- [Changefeeds](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) now properly invalidate cached range descriptors and retry when encountering [decommissioned nodes](../v20.2/remove-nodes.html). [#67024][#67024]

### Performance improvements

- Added the ability to continue generating histograms when [table statistics](../v20.2/create-statistics.html) collection reaches memory limits, instead of disabling histogram generation. [#67059][#67059]
