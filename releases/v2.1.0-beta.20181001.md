### Security bug fix

- Fixed a vulnerability in which TLS certificates were not validated correctly for internal RPC interfaces. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user with network access to read and write to the cluster. [#30821](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/30821)

### SQL language changes

- The entries in the `replicas` column of the `crdb_internal.ranges` virtual table are now always sorted by store
ID.
- The `EXPERIMENTAL_RELOCATE` statement no longer temporarily increases the number of replicas in a range more than one above the range's replication factor, preventing rare edge cases of unavailability.

### Command-line changes

- The `--log-dir`, `--log-dir-max-size`, `--log-file-max-size`, and `--log-file-verbosity` flags are now only available for the [`cockroach start`](../v2.1/start-a-node.html) and [`cockroach demo`](../v2.1/cockroach-demo.html) commands. Previously, these flags were available for other commands but rarely used or functional. [#30341][#30341] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Admin UI changes

- The new **SQL Query Errors** graph on the [**SQL** dashboard](../v2.1/admin-ui-sql-dashboard.html) shows the number of queries that returned a runtime or execution error. [#30371][#30371] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Hovering over a truncated entry in the [**Events** panel](../v2.1/admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html#events-panel) now shows the full description of the event. [#30391][#30391]

### Bug fixes

- The [`cockroach demo`](../v2.1/cockroach-demo.html) command now runs with replication disabled. [#30517][#30517]
- The [**Jobs** page](../v2.1/admin-ui-jobs-page.html) now sorts by **Creation Time** by default instead of by **User**. [#30428][#30428]
- Fixed a panic in the [optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) code when generator functions such as `generate_series()` are used as the argument to an aggregate function. [#30362][#30362]
- Corrected the help text for [`EXPORT`](../v2.1/export.html). [#30425][#30425]
- Ignored more unsupported clauses in [`IMPORT ... PGDUMP`](../v2.1/import.html). [#30425][#30425]
- Fixed [`IMPORT`](../v2.1/import.html) of empty or small tables under rare conditions. [#30425][#30425]
- Fixed a panic when generator functions such as `unnest()` are used in the [`SELECT`](../v2.1/select-clause.html) list
  with `GROUP BY`. [#30462][#30462]
- Fixed a panic caused by columns being reordered when using [`UPSERT`](../v2.1/upsert.html) with a `RETURNING` clause. [#30467][#30467]
- Fixed a panic when a [correlated subquery](../v2.1/subqueries.html#correlated-subqueries) in the `WHERE` clause contains an aggregate function referencing the outer query. This now causes an error since aggregates are not allowed in `WHERE`. [#30522][#30522]
- Corrected the list of permitted values printed when a non-permitted value is set for the `distsql` [session variable](../v2.1/set-vars.html). [#30631][#30631]

### Performance improvements

- Removed unnecessary synchronous disk writes caused by erroneous logic in the Raft implementation. [#30459][#30459]
- Range replicas are now automatically rebalanced throughout the cluster to even out the amount of QPS being handled by each node by default. Previously, this was available as a cluster setting but was not the default behavior. [#30649][#30649] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
