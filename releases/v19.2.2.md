### General changes

- Improved the consistency checker's log output. [#42149][#42149]
- Nodes that have been terminated as the result of a failed consistency check now refuse to restart, making it more likely that the operator notices that there is a persistent issue in a timely manner. [#42149][#42149]
- Client usernames can now be defined to start with a digit; in particular, all-digit usernames are now permitted. [#42989][#42989]
- To curb the spread of corrupted data, outliers are now terminated when the replicas within a range are corrupted. Previously, the leaseholder replica would terminate, regardless of which replicas disagreed with each other. [#42149][#42149]

### Enterprise edition changes

- [`RESTORE`](../v19.2/restore.html) now supports the restoration of empty databases. [#42733][#42733]

### SQL language changes

- Added the ability to run `avg()` over intervals. [#42679][#42679]
- Some columns (`typinput`, `typoutput`, `typreceive`, `typsend`, `typmodin`, `typmodout`, `typanalyze`) in `pg_type` were incorrectly typed as `OID` instead of `REGPROC`. This issue has been resolved. [#42784][#42784]
- It is now valid for `SELECT` and `HAVING` to refer to ungrouped columns in the special case when the grouped columns contain the primary key of the table containing the ungrouped column. [#42694][#42694]
- It is now supported to specify selection target aliases as `GROUP BY` columns. Note that the `FROM` columns take precedence over the aliases, which are only used if there is no column with that name in the current scope. [#42694][#42694]
- CockroachDB will now report a more accurate error message, hint, and error code if an error is encountered while adding a new column. [#42530][#42530]

### Command-line changes

- `--global` flag is now marked as hidden. [#41938][#41938]

### Bug fixes

- The [`TIMESTAMP`](../v19.2/timestamp.html) data type is now fully supported by the [vectorized engine](../v19.2/vectorized-execution.html). Previously, an "unsupported type" error was thrown. [#42576][#42576]
- Previously, casting the same type into two or more different precisions/widths from a table in the same `SELECT` query would result in only the first precision specified. For example, `SELECT a::decimal(10, 3), a::decimal(10, 1) FROM t` would return both results as `a::decimal(10, 3)`. This PR fixes that behavior. [#42578][#42578]
- Fixed a bug that would produce a spurious failure with the error message "incompatible `COALESCE` expressions" when adding or validating `MATCH FULL` foreign key constraints involving composite keys with columns of differing types. [#42651][#42651]
- It is now possible to transfer range leases to lagging replicas. [#42761][#42761]
- Long running transactions which attempt to [`TRUNCATE`](../v19.2/truncate.html) can now be pushed and will commit in cases where they previously failed or retried forever. [#42772][#42772]
- Fixed a case in which CockroachDB incorrectly determined that a query (or part of a query) that contains an `IS NULL` constraint on a unique index column returns at most one row, possibly ignoring a `LIMIT 1` clause. [#42791][#42791]
- [`ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS`](../v19.2/alter-index.html) no longer fails when using an unqualified index name that does not match any existing index. Now it is a no-op. [#42838][#42838]
- Fixed a bug with incorrect handling of Top _K_ sort by the vectorized engine when _K_ is greater than 1024. [#42843][#42843]
- Prevent internal error in some cases when a _NULL_ literal is passed to the `OVERLAPS` operator [#42878][#42878]
- Fixed a bug that caused rare crashes when using built-in functions. [#42674][#42674]
- Other callers to `acquireNodeLease` now do not get erroneously cancelled just because the context of the first caller was cancelled. [#42893][#42893]
- Changefeeds now emit backfill row updates for a dropped column when the table descriptor drops that column. [#42669][#42669]
- Tables that are being restored or imported are no longer considered valid targets in backups and changefeeds. [#42735][#42735]
- Fixed a bug where selecting columns by forcing an `INTERLEAVING` index would return an error instead of returning the correct results. [#42901][#42901]
- CockroachDB now prevents a number of panics from the SQL layer caused by an invalid range split. These would usually manifest with messages containing encoding errors like "found null on not null column". [#42859][#42859]
- Fixed the row count estimate during query planning for some queries with multiple predicates in which the selectivity of one predicate was calculated using a histogram. [#42962][#42962]
- Previously, when executing a built-in function via the vectorized engine that returns an output type unsupported by the vectorized engine, CockroachDB could return an error instead of falling back to the row-by-row execution engine. This is now fixed. [#42990][#42990]
- Empty arrays are now correctly encoded and decoded over the binary protocol. [#42974][#42974]
- Fixed some existing caching issues surrounding role memberships, where users could sometimes see out-of-date role membership information. [#43004][#43004]
- Previously, attempting to parse `0000-01-01 00:00` when involving `time` did not work as `pgdate` does not understand `0000` as a year. This is now fixed. [#42918][#42918]
- The allocator now considers stores with very close diversity scores equal (all other things being the same) and doesn't attempt to rebalance. [#43077][#43077]
- The allocator now considers the new store being added when looking for a target in the case of a rebalance. [#43077][#43077]
- CockroachDB did not previously handle date casts from `TIMESTAMP`/`TIMESTAMPZ` with time attached for times before the UNIX epoch correctly. For example, `'1969-12-30 01:00:00'::timestamp` would round to `'1969-12-31'` instead of `'1969-12-30'`. This is now fixed. [#43022][#43022]
- Fixed a bug that caused the server to hang on HTTP timeouts. [#42539][#42539]
- Server now properly authenticates admin RPC requests. [#42726][#42726]
