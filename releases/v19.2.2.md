### General changes

- Improved the consistency checker's log output. [#42149][#42149]
- Nodes that have been terminated as the result of a failed consistency check now refuse to restart, making it more likely that the operator notices that there is a persistent issue in a timely manner. [#42149][#42149]
- Client usernames can now be defined to start with a digit; in particular, all-digit usernames are now permitted. [#42989][#42989]
- When the replicas within a range are corrupted, outliers are now terminated. Previously, the leaseholder replica would terminate, regardless of which replicas disagreed with each other. This is expected to curb the spreading of corrupted data better than the previous approach. [#42149][#42149]

### Enterprise edition changes

- `RESTORE` now supports the restoration of empty databases. [#42733][#42733]

### SQL language changes

- Added the ability to run `avg()` over intervals. [#42679][#42679]
- Some columns (`typinput`, `typoutput`, `typreceive`, `typsend`, `typmodin`, `typmodout`, `typanalyze`) in `pg_type` were incorrectly typed as `OID` instead of `REGPROC`. This issue has been resolved. [#42784][#42784]
- It is now valid for `SELECT` and `HAVING` to refer to ungrouped columns in the special case when the grouped columns contain the primary key of the table containing the ungrouped column. [#42694][#42694]
- It is now supported to specify selection target aliases as `GROUP BY` columns. Note that the `FROM` columns take precedence over the aliases, which are only used if there is no column with that name in the current scope. [#42694][#42694]
- CockroachDB will now report a more accurate error message, hint, and error code if an error is encountered while adding a new column. [#42530][#42530]

### Command-line changes

- `--global` flag is now marked as hidden. [#41938][41938]

### Bug fixes

- The [`TIMESTAMP`](../v19.2/timestamp.html) data type is now fully supported by the vectorized engine. Previously, an "unsupported type" error might occur. [#42576][#42576]
- Previously, casting the same type into two or more different precisions/widths from a table in the same `SELECT` query would result in only the first precision specified. For example, `SELECT a::decimal(10, 3), a::decimal(10, 1) FROM t` would return both results as `a::decimal(10, 3)`. This PR fixes that behavior. [#42578][#42578]
- Fixed a bug that would produce a spurious failure with the error message "incompatible `COALESCE` expressions" when adding or validating `MATCH FULL` foreign key constraints involving composite keys with columns of differing types. [#42651][#42651]
- It is now possible to transfer range leases to lagging replicas. [#42761][#42761]
- Long running transactions which attempt to [`TRUNCATE`](../v19.2/truncate.html) can now be pushed and will commit in cases where they previously failed or retried forever. [#42772][#42772]
- Fixed a case in which CockroachDB incorrectly determined that a query (or part of a query) that contains an `IS NULL` constraint on a unique index column returns at most one row, possibly ignoring a `LIMIT 1` clause. [#42791][#42791]
- [`ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS`](../v19.2/alter-index.html) no longer fails when using an unqualified index name that does not match any existing index. Now it is a no-op. [#42838][#42838]
- Fixed a bug with incorrect handling of Top _K_ sort by the vectorized engine when _K_ is greater than 1024. [#42843][#42843]
- Prevent internal error in some cases when a _NULL_ literal is passed to the `OVERLAPS` operator [#42878][#42878]
- Fixed a bug that caused rare crashes when using built-in functions. [#42674][#42674]
- Other callers to `acquireNodeLease` now do not get erroneously cancelled just because the context of the first caller was cancelled. [#42893][#42893]
- Changefeeds now emit backfill row updates for a dropped column when the table descriptor drops that column. [#42669][#42669]
- Tables that are being restored or imported are no longer considered valid targets in backups and changefeeds. [#42735][#42735]
- Fixed a bug where selecting columns by forcing an `INTERLEAVING` index would return an error instead of returning the correct results. [#42901][#42901]
- CockroachDB now prevents a number of panics from the SQL layer caused by an invalid range split. These would usually manifest with messages containing encoding errors like "found null on not null column". [#42859][#42859]
- Fixed the row count estimate during query planning for some queries with multiple predicates in which the selectivity of one predicate was calculated using a histogram. [#42962][#42962]
- Previously, when executing a built-in function via the vectorized engine that returns an output type unsupported by the vectorized engine, CockroachDB could return an error instead of falling back to the row-by-row execution engine. This is now fixed. [#42990][#42990]
- Empty arrays are now correctly encoded and decoded over the binary protocol. [#42974][#42974]
- Fixed some existing caching issues surrounding role memberships, where users could sometimes see out-of-date role membership information. [#43004][#43004]
- Previously, attempting to parse `0000-01-01 00:00` when involving `time` did not work as `pgdate` does not understand `0000` as a year. This is now fixed. [#42918][#42918]
- The allocator now considers stores with very close diversity scores equal (all other things being the same) and doesn't attempt to rebalance. [#43077][#43077]
- The allocator now considers the new store being added when looking for a target in the case of a rebalance. [#43077][#43077]
- CockroachDB did not previously handle date casts from `TIMESTAMP`/`TIMESTAMPZ` with time attached for times before the UNIX epoch correctly. For example, `'1969-12-30 01:00:00'::timestamp` would round to `'1969-12-31'` instead of `'1969-12-30'`. This is now fixed. [#43022][#43022]
- Fixed a bug that caused the server to hang on HTTP timeouts. [#42539][#42539]
- Server now properly authenticates admin RPC requests. [#42726][#42726]
