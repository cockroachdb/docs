### Backward-incompatible changes

- The file names for heap profile dumps are now `memprof.<date-and-time>.<heapsize>`, where previously they were named `memprof.<heapsize>.<date-and-time>`. [#55260][#55260]

### SQL language changes

- Fixed a bug where temporary tables may be included in [`BACKUP`](../v20.1/backup.html) commands. [#56475][#56475]

### Command-line changes

- CockroachDB now better attempts to retain heap profile dumps after a crash due to an out-of-memory error. [#55260][#55260]
- CockroachDB now better attempts to retain memory statistics corresponding to increases in total memory usage, not just heap allocations. [#55260][#55260]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a panic that could occur when running [`SHOW STATISTICS USING JSON`](../v20.1/show-statistics.html) for a table in which at least one of the columns contained all null values. [#56515][#56515]
- The file names for generated `goroutine`, CPU and memory profiles were sometimes incorrect, resulting in repeated warnings like `strconv.ParseUint: parsing "txt": invalid syntax` in log files. This has been corrected. [#55260][#55260]
- Fixed a bug when the Pebble storage engine is used with [encryption-at-rest](../v20.1/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise) that could result in data corruption in some fairly rare cases after a table drop, table truncate, or replica deletion. [#56680][#56680]
- Previously, dumps of tables with a [`BIT`](../v20.1/bit.html) type column would result in an error. This column type is now supported. [#56452][#56452]
- In 20.1.8, we attempted to fix `age`'s lack of normalization of `H:M:S` into the years, months, and days field. However, this was also broken for values greater than 1 month, as well as breaking `a::timestamp(tz) - b::timestamp(tz)` operators. This has now been resolved. [#56769][#56769]
- CockroachDB previously would crash when executing a query with an [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v20.1/as-of-system-time.html) clause that used a placeholder (note that it wasn't a prepared statement, it was an attempt to use an unspecified placeholder value on a non-prepared statement). This is now fixed. [#56781][#56781]
- CockroachDB previously could encounter an internal error when [`DATE`](../v20.1/date.html), [`TIMESTAMP`](../v20.1/timestamp.html), or [`TIMESTAMPTZ`](../v20.1/timestamp.html) values that used year 1 BC were sent between nodes for execution. Additionally, previously it was not possible to specify `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, or `TIMESTAMPTZ` values with year 1 BC without using AD/BC notation. This is now fixed. [#56743][#56743]
- Fixed internal error when collecting a statement diagnostic bundle in some cases where the query hits an error. [#56785][#56785]
- Some boolean session variables would only accept string (`"true"` or `"false"`) values. Now they also accept unquoted true or false values. [#56814][#56814]
- Fixed a bug which would prevent the dropping of hash sharded indexes if they were added prior to other columns. [#55823][#55823]
- Fixed a race condition in the [`tpcc`](../v20.1/performance-benchmarking-with-tpc-c-10-warehouses.html) workload with the `--scatter` flag where tables could be scattered multiple times or not at all. [#56979][#56979]
- Previously if a cluster backup that was taken during a schema change, a cluster restore of that backup would create duplicates of the ongoing schema changes. [#56450][#56450]
- Fixed a case where attempting to start a second [`BACKUP`](../v20.1/backup.html) to the same location while the first was running using passphrase-based encryption could overwrite the metadata required to decrypt it and thus render it unreadable. [#57025][#57025]
- Fixed an internal error when using aggregates and window functions in an `ORDER BY` for a [`UNION or VALUES` clause](../v20.1/selection-queries.html). [#57522][#57522]
- The [`CREATE TEMP TABLE AS`](../v20.1/temporary-tables.html) statement previously created a non-temporary table. Now it makes a temporary one. [#57550][#57550]
- Fixed a bug where schema change jobs to add foreign keys to existing tables, via [`ALTER TABLE`](../v20.1/alter-table.html), could sometimes not be successfully reverted (either due to being canceled or having failed). [#57810][#57810]
- Fixed a bug where concurrent addition of a [foreign key constraint](../v20.1/foreign-key.html) and drop of a unique index could cause the foreign key constraint to be added with no unique constraint on the referenced columns. [#57810][#57810]
- Fixed a bug which can occur when canceling [schema changes](../v20.1/online-schema-changes.html) when there are multiple queued schema changes that could result in future schema changes being stuck. [#55058][#55058]
- Fixed a bug which can lead to canceled [schema change](../v20.1/online-schema-changes.html) jobs ending in the failed rather than canceled state. [#55058][#55058]

### Performance improvements

- Interactions between Raft heartbeats and the Raft `goroutine` pool scheduler are now more efficient and avoid excessive mutex contention. This was observed to prevent instability on large machines (32+ vCPU) in clusters with many ranges (50k+ per node). [#57009][#57009]

#### Backward-compatible change

- The reserved, non-documented [cluster settings](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html) `server.heap_profile.xxx` have been renamed to `server.mem_profile.xxx`. They now control collection of multiple sorts of memory profiles besides just Go heap allocations. [#55260][#55260]
