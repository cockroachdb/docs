### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- Security-related command-line arguments have been changed. Instead of using multiple flags, certificates and keys are now loaded from a single [`--certs-dir`](../v1.0/create-security-certificates.html#certificate-directory) flag, which defaults to `~/.cockroach-certs` but can be set to a custom location. The individual flags still work in this release but will be removed in the next one. Also note that the `--insecure` flag is now **required** for insecure mode. [#14703](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14703)
- The `--alsologtostderr` argument has been renamed to `--logtostderr`, and now takes an optional argument to specify a threshold. [#14841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14841)
- The `^` operator now means `pow()` instead of bitwise xor (bitwise xor uses the `#` operator; this is consistent with PostgreSQL). Any tables with this operator in a [`DEFAULT`](../v1.0/default-value.html) or [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) expression will need to be updated. [#14882](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14882)

### Upgrade Notes

- This release cannot run at the same time as releases prior to [`beta-20170413`](beta-20170413.html). If you are running an older version, you must either upgrade to that version first or take down all servers in the cluster before starting any server with this version. This release includes new functionality to make future upgrades smoother. [#14959](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14959)

### Build Changes

- CockroachDB's build system has been rewritten to improve portability. It can no longer be installed with `go get` alone; use of the `Makefile` is now required. GNU Make, CMake, and XZ Utils must also be installed to build from source. As a result, CockroachDB can now be built on a larger variety of systems. [#14840](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14840)

### SQL Language Changes

- Type errors in [`CHECK`](../v1.0/check.html) constraints are now detected earlier. [#14984](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14984)
- Aggregation functions now work correctly above the windowing level. [#14729](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14729)
- The default precision for inexact decimal operations is now 20 digits (up from 16). [#15001](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15001)
- Bounds are now checked when converting [`FLOAT`](../v1.0/float.html) or [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) values to [`INTEGER`](../v1.0/int.html). [#14967](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14967)
- The `pg_catalog` data for `int2vector` is now consistent with PostgreSQL. [#14989](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14989)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- The [`cockroach cert`](../v1.0/create-security-certificates.html) commands have been updated to reflect the new `--certs-dir` convention. [#14703](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14703)
- New flags `--log-file-max-size` (default 10 MiB) and `--log-dir-max-size` (default 100 MiB) can be used to control log rotation and deletion. The `--log-file-verbosity` flag (default `INFO`) can be used to control the verbosity of the log file. [#14841](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14841)
- Critical errors are now written to `stderr` regardless of the logging configuration. [#14926](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14926) [#15025](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15025) [#15040](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15040)
- The server will now reload its certificates and keys on a `SIGHUP`. [#14925](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14925)
- Some commands which previously required a `node` certificate now work with the `root` client certificate. [#14972](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14972)
- The undocumented `cockroach debug kv` commands have been removed. [#14857](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14857)
- The [`cockroach quit`](../v1.0/stop-a-node.html) command now has a hard timeout of 1 minute if the cluster has lost quorum. [#14708](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14708)

### Admin UI Changes

- Improved alert banners. [#14915](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14915) [#15010](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15010)

### Bug Fixes

- Transactions no longer get stuck forever when a split occurs while they are waiting for a conflicting transaction. [#14974](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14974)
- The Admin UI can now display tables with non-lowercase names. [#14818](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14818)
- Fixed a panic with "span and descriptor's range do not overlap". [#14952](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14952)
- Fixed a data race in the Prometheus exporter. [#14943](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14943)

### Performance Improvements

- The timestamp cache is now much more efficient, leading to a 42% speedup on single-node write-only benchmarks. [#14867](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14867)
- Transaction deadlocks are now detected faster. [#14789](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14789)
- Fixed a memory "leak" in Raft. [#15041](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15041)
- Improved performance of concurrent RPCs on a single GRPC connection. [#14939](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14939)
- Raft processing now uses more threads. [#14897](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14897)
- Improved performance of schema changes that add indexes. [#14937](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14937)
- Reduced the number of cgo calls for RocksDB iterators. [#14920](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14920)

### Doc Updates

- Expanded the [`TRUNCATE`](../v1.0/truncate.html) documentation to cover using `CASCADE` to truncate dependent tables. [#1297](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1297)
- Minor improvements to the [`ROLLBACK`](../v1.0/rollback-transaction.html) documentation. [#1296](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1296)
