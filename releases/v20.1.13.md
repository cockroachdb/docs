### Bug fixes

- Previously, if [`RELEASE SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](../v20.1/release-savepoint.html#commit-a-transaction-by-releasing-a-retry-savepoint) was followed by [`ROLLBACK`](../v20.1/rollback-transaction.html), the `sql.txn.rollback.count` metric would be incremented. This was incorrect, because the transaction had already committed. The metric is no longer incremented in this case. [#60251][#60251]
- Fixed a bug where an error in protecting a record could be incorrectly reported, preventing some backups of very large tables from succeeding. [#60961][#60961]
- Fixed a bug where high-latency global clusters could sometimes fall behind in [resolving timestamps for changefeeds](../v20.1/create-changefeed.html#messages). [#60926][#60926]
- Creating [interleaved](../v20.1/interleave-in-parent.html) partitioned indexes is now disallowed. Previously, the database would crash when trying to create one. Note that [interleaved tables will be deprecated altogether](../v20.2/interleave-in-parent.html#deprecation) in a future release. [#61423][#61423]
- In the Advanced Debugging section of the Admin UI (DB Console), manually enqueueing a range to the garbage collection (GC) queue now properly respects the `SkipShouldQueue` option. This ensures that you can force the GC of a specific range. [#60746][#60746]
