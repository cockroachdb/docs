For more details, see the [Managed CockroachDB](../cockroachcloud/quickstart.html) docs.

### Enterprise Features

These new features require an [enterprise license](../v2.1/enterprise-licensing.html). Register for a 30-day trial license [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/).

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[Change Data Capture](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) (Beta)|  Change data capture (CDC) provides efficient, distributed, row-level change feeds into Apache Kafka for downstream processing such as reporting, caching, or full-text indexing. Use the [`CREATE CHANGEFEED`](../v2.1/create-changefeed.html) statement to create a new changefeed, which provides row-level change subscriptions.
[Encryption at Rest](../v2.1/encryption.html) (Experimental) | Encryption at Rest provides transparent encryption of a node's data on the local disk.
[`EXPORT`](../v2.1/export.html) (Beta)| The `EXPORT` statement exports tabular data or the results of arbitrary SELECT statements to CSV files. Using the CockroachDB [distributed execution engine](../v2.1/architecture/sql-layer.html#distsql), `EXPORT` parallelizes CSV creation across all nodes in the cluster, making it possible to quickly get large sets of data out of CockroachDB in a format that can be ingested by downstream systems.

### Core Features

These new features are freely available in the core version and do not require an enterprise license.

#### SQL

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER TYPE`](../v2.1/alter-type.html) | The `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER TYPE` statement changes a column's [data type](../v2.1/data-types.html). Only type changes that neither require data checks nor data conversion are supported at this time.
[`ALTER COLUMN ... DROP STORED`](../v2.1/alter-column.html#convert-a-computed-column-into-a-regular-column) | The `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... DROP STORED` statement converts a stored, [computed column](../v2.1/computed-columns.html) into a regular column.
[`CANCEL JOB`](../v2.1/cancel-job.html) | The `CANCEL JOB` statement can now be executed on long-running schema change jobs, causing them to terminate early and roll back. Also, the `CANCEL JOBS` variant of the statement lets you cancel multiple jobs at once.
[`CANCEL QUERIES`](../v2.1/cancel-query.html) | The `CANCEL QUERIES` variant of the `CANCEL QUERY` statement lets you cancel multiple queries at once.
[`CANCEL SESSIONS`](../v2.1/cancel-session.html) | The `CANCEL SESSIONS` variant of the `CANCEL SESSION` statement lets you stop multiple long-running sessions. `CANCEL SESSION` will attempt to cancel the currently active query and end the session.
[Cost-Based Optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) | The cost-based optimizer seeks the lowest cost for a query, usually related to time. In versions 2.1 and later, CockroachDB's cost-based optimizer is enabled by default.
[`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v2.1/create-statistics.html) (Experimental) | The `CREATE STATISTICS` statement generates table statistics for the [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) to use.
[`EXPLAIN (DISTSQL)`](../v2.1/explain.html#distsql-option) | The `DISTSQL` option generates a physical query plan for a query. Query plans provide information around SQL execution, which can be used to troubleshoot slow queries.
[`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v2.1/explain-analyze.html) | The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement executes a SQL query and returns a physical query plan with execution statistics.
[Fast Deletes for Interleaved Tables](../v2.1/interleave-in-parent.html#benefits) | Under certain conditions, deleting rows from interleave tables that use [`ON DELETE CASCADE`](../v2.1/add-constraint.html#add-the-foreign-key-constraint-with-cascade) will use an optimized code path and run much faster.
[Lookup Joins](../v2.1/joins.html#lookup-joins) (Experimental) | A lookup join is beneficial to use when there is a large imbalance in size between the two tables, as it only reads the smaller table and then looks up matches in the larger table. A lookup join requires that the right-hand (i.e., larger) table is indexed on the equality column.
[`public` Role](../v2.1/authorization.html#create-and-manage-roles) | All users now belong to the `public` role, to which you can [grant](../v2.1/grant.html) and [revoke](../v2.1/revoke.html) privileges.
[`SET` (session variable)](../v2.1/set-vars.html)<br>[`SHOW` (session variable)](../v2.1/show-vars.html) | Added the following options: <ul><li>`statement_timeout`: The amount of time a statement can run before being stopped.</li><li>`optimizer`: The mode in which a query execution plan is generated. If set to `on`, the cost-based optimizer is enabled by default and the heuristic planner will only be used if the query is not supported by the cost-based optimizer; if set to `off`, all queries are run through the legacy heuristic planner.</li></ul>
[`SHOW STATISTICS`](../v2.1/show-statistics.html) (Experimental) | The `SHOW STATISTICS` statement lists [table statistics](../v2.1/create-statistics.html) used by the [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html).
[`SNAPSHOT` isolation level](../v2.1/transactions.html#isolation-levels) | **Removed.** Transactions that request to use `SNAPSHOT` are now mapped to [`SERIALIZABLE`](../v2.1/demo-serializable.html).
[Subquery Support](../v2.1/subqueries.html#correlated-subqueries) | CockroachDB's [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) supports several common types of correlated subqueries. A subquery is said to be "correlated" when it uses table or column names defined in the surrounding query.

#### CLI

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[`cockroach demo`](../v2.1/cockroach-demo.html) | The `cockroach demo` command starts a temporary, in-memory, single-node CockroachDB cluster and opens an [interactive SQL shell](../v2.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) to it.
[`cockroach start`](../v2.1/start-a-node.html) | The new `--advertise-addr` flag recognizes both a hostname/address and port and replaces the `--advertise-host` and `--advertise-port` flags, which are now deprecated.<br><br>The new `--listen-addr` flag recognizes both a hostname/address and port and replaces the `--host` and `--port` flags, which are now deprecated for `cockroach start` but remain valid for other client commands.<br><br>The new `--http-addr` flag recognizes both a hostname/address and port and replaces the `--http-host` flag, which is now deprecated.
[`cockroach sql`](../v2.1/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) | The `cockroach sql` command and other client commands that display SQL results now use the new table result formatter by default, replacing the previous formatter called `pretty`. This provides more compact and more reusable results.
`cockroach zone` | **Deprecated.** The `cockroach zone` command has been deprecated. To manage [replication zones](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html), use the [`CONFIGURE ZONE`](../v2.1/configure-zone.html) statement to [add](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html#create-a-replication-zone-for-a-system-range), [modify](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html#edit-the-default-replication-zone), [reset](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html#reset-a-replication-zone), and [remove](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html#remove-a-replication-zone) replication zones.

#### Operations

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[Controlling Leaseholder Location](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html#constrain-leaseholders-to-specific-datacenters) | Using replication zones, you can now specify preferences for where a range's leaseholders should be placed to increase performance in some scenarios.
[DBeaver Support](../v2.1/third-party-database-tools.html) | DBeaver, a cross-platform database GUI, has been thoroughly vetted and tested with CockroachDB v2.1.
[Load-based Rebalancing](../v2.1/architecture/replication-layer.html#membership-changes-rebalance-repair) | In addition to the rebalancing that occurs when nodes join or leave a cluster, leases and replicas are rebalanced automatically based on the relative load across the nodes within a cluster. Note that depending on the needs of your deployment, you can exercise additional control over the location of leases and replicas by [configuring replication zones](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html).
[Migration from Postgres and MySQL](../v2.1/migration-overview.html) | The `IMPORT` command now supports importing dump files from Postgres and MySQL.
[Monitoring Kubernetes Deployments](../v2.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) | Kubernetes tutorials now feature steps on how to integrate with[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), an open source tool for storing, aggregating, and querying timeseries data, and set up [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/).
[Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Deployments](../v2.1/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes-multi-cluster.html) | You can now orchestrate a secure CockroachDB deployment across three Kubernetes clusters, each in a different geographic region, using the StatefulSet feature to manage the containers within each cluster and linking them together via DNS.
[Pipelining of Transactional Writes](../v2.1/architecture/transaction-layer.html#transaction-pipelining) | Transactional writes are pipelined when being replicated and when being written to disk, dramatically reducing the latency of transactions that perform multiple writes.
[Preferring Local Networks](../v2.1/start-a-node.html)| The new `--locality-advertise-addr` flag on [`cockroach start`](../v2.1/start-a-node.html#networking) can be used to tell nodes in specific localities to prefer local or private interfaces. This flag is useful when running a cluster across multiple networks, where nodes in a given network have access to a private or local interface while nodes outside the network do not.
[Rolling Upgrade Auto-finalization](../v2.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) | By default, as soon as all nodes are running CockroachDB v2.1, the upgrade process will be **auto-finalized**. This will enable certain performance improvements and bug fixes introduced in the new version.
[Viewing Node Status for an Unavailable Cluster](../v2.1/view-node-details.html) | The `cockroach node status` command can now be run even when majority of nodes are down. Running the command now shows an additional field: `is_available.`

#### Admin UI

Feature | Description
--------|------------
[Advanced Debugging Page](../v2.1/admin-ui-debug-pages.html) (Experimental) | The **Advanced Debugging** page provides links to advanced monitoring and troubleshooting reports and cluster configuration details.
[Hardware Dashboard](../v2.1/admin-ui-hardware-dashboard.html) | The **Hardware** dashboard lets you monitor CPU usage, disk throughput, network traffic, storage capacity, and memory.
[Statements page](../v2.1/admin-ui-statements-page.html) | The **Statements** page helps you identify frequently executed or high latency SQL statements. It also allows you to view the details of SQL statement fingerprints, which are groupings of similar SQL statements with literal values replaced by underscores.
[User Authentication](../v2.1/admin-ui-access-and-navigate.html) | As of v2.1, users must have a [username and password](../v2.1/create-user.html) to access the Admin UI in a secure cluster.
