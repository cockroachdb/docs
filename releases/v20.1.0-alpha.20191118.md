### General changes

- Guidance on [how to contribute to CockroachDB](https://cockroachlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/x/QQFdB) has been moved to the public wiki at [wiki.crdb.io](https://cockroachlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/). [#41542][#41542]
- Removed the `kv.bulk_io_write.addsstable_max_rate` [cluster setting](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html). [#41745][#41745] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Improved the consistency checker's log output. [#41893][#41893]
- When the replicas within a range are found to be corrupted, the outliers will be terminated. Previously, the leaseholder replica would terminate, regardless of which replicas disagreed with each other. This is expected to curb the spread of corrupted data better than the previous approach. [#41902][#41902]

### Backward-incompatible changes

- The `extract()` [built-in function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html) with sub-second arguments (millisecond, microsecond) is now Postgres-compatible, and will return the total number of seconds in addition to sub-seconds. Anyone who was previously relying on `extract()` to return only sub-second data will need to adjust their applications. [#41069][#41069] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Enterprise edition changes

- [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html) statements now support specifying CSV filenames using wildcard characters. This behavior can be disabled with the `WITH disabled_glob_matching` option. [#40714][#40714] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- When using a `nodelocal` file URL for [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html)/[`BACKUP`](../v20.1/backup.html)/[`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html)/[`EXPORT`](../v20.1/export.html), you can now specify which node's local file system to use by including the node's ID in the URL: `nodelocal://<nodeID>/path/file.csv`. [#41990][#41990] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the new `WITH experimental_save_rejected` option for skipping faulty rows during `IMPORT`, saving the faulty rows in a file called `<original_csv_file>.rejected`. After fixing the problems in this file, you can use it with `IMPORT INTO`. [#41430][#41430] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- The `extract()` [built-in function](../v20.1/functions-and-operators.html) now supports millennium, century, decade, isoyear, isodow, and julian for `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `TIMESTAMPTZ`. The `date_trunct()` function now supports millennium, century, and decade for `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `TIMESTAMPTZ`. [#41784][#41784] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `extract()` now supports a string constant as element argument. [#41429][#41429]
- Added support for the `JOIN LATERAL` syntax. [#40945][#40945] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for `WITH RECURSIVE` with `UNION ALL`. [#41368][#41368] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for `bit_and()` and `bit_or()` aggregate functions. [#41334][#41334] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `NULL` values are now allowed to be among tuples when being compared against a tuple. [#40298][#40298]
- Added syntax-only support for `ORDER BY ... NULLS FIRST | LAST`. [#41544][#41544] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Comments can now be associated to indexes with `COMMENT ON INDEX` and can be checked with `SHOW INDEXES FROM ... WITH COMMENT`. [#41555][#41555] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `SELECT` and `HAVING` can now refer to ungrouped columns when the grouped columns contain the primary key of the table containing the ungrouped columns. [#41732][#41732] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Dropping a unique index that was created via `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statement no longer requires the `CASCADE` option. [#42001][#42001] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `pg_prepared_statements` table. [#42018][#42018]

### Command-line changes

- The new `--storage-engine` flag for [`cockroach start`](../v20.1/cockroach-start.html), and equivalent `COCKROACH_STORAGE_ENGINE` environment variable, specify the type of storage engine a node should use. Options are `rocksdb` (default) and `pebble`. [#41453][#41453] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Enhanced the error message produced by [`cockroach init`](../v20.1/initialize-a-cluster.html) when it encounters an already-initialized cluster to recommend adding `--join` to the `cockroach start` commands. [#42318][#42318]

### Bug fixes

- The Admin UI no longer mixes unit sizes in timeseries graph tooltips. [#40970][#40970]
- The `pg_collation_for()` function now correctly quotes its output. [#41545][#41545]
- Fixed an internal error when subqueries are used in arguments to commands like `SET`. [#41581][#41581]
- CockroachDB now properly emits the cluster ID, once known, to all secondary log files (SQL audit logging, statement execution logging, and RocksDB events) and properly removes excess secondary log files. [#40993][#40993]
- Other callers to `acquireNodeLease` will not get erroneously cancelled just because the context of the first caller was cancelled. [#41785][#41785]
- Vectorized execution no longer errors when adding an ordinality column to an expression with a limit. For example, `SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM foo LIMIT 1) WITH ORDINALITY` no longer throws an index out of range error. [#41782][#41782]
- Fixed a bug causing rare crashes when using built-in functions. [#41970][#41970]
- The `date_trunc()` function now correctly considers timezones for `TIMESTAMPTZ` and `DATE` types. [#42006][#42006]
- Fixed a bug causing `CREATE TABLE AS` statements to fail with the message "unexpected concurrency for a flow that was forced to be planned locally". [#42013][#42013]
- Fixed a bug where `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION` and `crdb_internal.zones` would show results for resources the user does not have permission to view. [#42066][#42066], [#42080][#42080]
- Fixed a bug during planning for some queries that could cause an infinite loop and prevent the query from being cancelled. [#42082][#42082]
- Fixed a bug that caused jobs for dropping tables to report an inaccurate status. [#42121][#42121]
- Fixed a bug where rapid network disconnections could lead to cluster unavailability. [#41533][#41533]
- Fixed a stack overflow that could occur with certain patterns of queries. [#41984][#41984]
- Fixed some casts from `OID` to `TEXT`. [#41928][#41928]
- Fixed a bug where some cluster setting changes were not reflected during currently running `IMPORT`s. [#42268][#42268]
- Fixed bugs where: `<date>:date` would result in the previous day (`<date-1>::date>`) when context local timestamp is set and the timezone is less than UTC+00:00; `date_trunc()` for `TIMESTAMP` would produce incorrect results if a local timezone was set; and `date_trunc()` for `DATE` would produce an incorrect negative timezone offset in a local timezone. [#42267][#42267]
- Casting `TIMESTAMPTZ` data to the `TIME` type NOW properly respects time zone information. [#42269][#42269]
- Fixed a crash when using `EXPLAIN (VEC)` on some index joins. [#40897][#40897]

### Performance improvements

- Improved performance for some join queries due to improved filter inference during query planning. [#41250][#41250]
- Improved statistics estimation during query planning for columns with many `NULL` values. [#41520][#41520]
- The `cockroach debug check-store` command is now faster. [#41805][#41805]
- Improved the low-level performance of short range reverse scans. [#42092][#42092]
- Individual response messages in a response batch no longer each contain information about transaction state changes. [#42139][#42139]
- `BACKUP` work is now more evenly spread across clusters that have non-uniform leaseholder distributions. [#42274][#42274]
