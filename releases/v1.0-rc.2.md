### General Changes

- [Diagnostics reporting](../v1.0/diagnostics-reporting.html) now includes anonymized query statistics. [#15491](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15491)

### SQL Language Changes

- Restrictions on schema changes in transactions with other statements have been relaxed. It is now possible to insert into a table in the same transaction that created it, provided there are no [`FOREIGN KEY`](../v1.0/foreign-key.html) or [`INTERLEAVE`](../v1.0/interleave-in-parent.html) clauses. [#15511](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15511)
- The distributed SQL engine supports queries that internally generate rows with no columns. [#15420](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15420)
- New variables added to the [cluster-wide settings](../v1.0/cluster-settings.html): `server.declined_reservation_timeout`, `server.failed_reservation_timeout`, and `server.time_until_store_dead`. [#15581](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15581)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- If the new flag `--listening-url-file` is passed to [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html), the server will write its SQL connection URL to the specified file on successful startup, in addition to printing it to `stdout`. This is particularly helpful in identifying the node's port when an unused port is assigned automatically (`--port=0`).[#15468](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15468)
- The [`cockroach sql`](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell no longer buffers all results in memory before printing them. [#15277](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15277)
- The log file is now flushed more reliably when a node exits. [#15531](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15531)
- The new flag `--max-offset` on the [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command defines the maximum allowed clock offset for the cluster and replaces the environment variable `COCKROACH_MAX_OFFSET`. Note that the `--max-offset` value must be the same on all nodes in the cluster. In order to change it, every node in the cluster must be stopped and restarted with the new value. [#15568](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15568)
- The `--raft-tick-interval` flag has been removed from the [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command. [#15547](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15547)
- Certificate and key loading errors during node startup are now reported to the user via `stdout` as well as being written to the log file. [#15655](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15655)

### Admin UI Changes

- The number of transactions that would be affected by a change in isolation level is now tracked. [#15234](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15234)
- Improved style of the single node and log pages. [#15486](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15486)
- The event log now refreshes automatically. [#15502](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15502)
- Graphs on the overview page now have tooltips. [#15624](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15624)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a panic when a query returning a constant `NULL` uses the new distributed execution engine. [#15530](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15530)
- Fixed two issues that could cause requests to get stuck indefinitely. [#15557](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15557) [#15573](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15573)
- Fixed a rare crash when extending table leases. [#15560](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15560)
- Fixed a crash when a transaction that uses [`SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart`](../v1.0/savepoint.html) does something other than `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` after an error. [#15563](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15563)
- Fixed [`RESTORE`](../v1.0/restore.html) for interleaved tables. [#15564](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15564)
- Return parse error instead of panic when constant typechecking fails. [#15636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15636)
- Prevent persistent distsql and schema change errors after a node dies. [#15368](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15368)
- Previously, [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v1.0/add-column.html) with a `DEFAULT unique_rowid()` specification could create many duplicate values. This has been corrected. [#15628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15628)
- Fixed a consistency error in [`BACKUP`](../v1.0/backup.html). [#15642](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15642)
- Fixed incorrect NULL results when using an aggregation with an empty table. [#15688](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15688)

### Performance Improvements

- Reduced thrashing in gossip after a rolling restart. [#15533](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15533)
- [`RESTORE`](../v1.0/restore.html) performs its pre-splitting less aggressively. [#15548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15548)
- Improved memory accounting in distributed SQL. [#15595](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15595), [#15610](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15610), [#15623](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15623), [#15627](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15627)
- Queries using session-dependent variables (e.g., time conversions using the session's timezone) are now executed through the distributed SQL engine. [#15628](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/15628)

### Doc Updates

- Added an FAQ on different [ways to log SQL queries](../v1.0/sql-faqs.html). [#1359](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1359)
- Updated [local deployment tutorials](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster.html) to have nodes listen only on `localhost`. This ensures these tutorials work even on machines whose hostnames aren’t resolvable. [#1358](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1358)
