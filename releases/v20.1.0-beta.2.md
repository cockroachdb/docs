title: What's New in v20.1.0-beta.2
toc: true
summary: Additions and changes in CockroachDB version v20.1.0-beta.2 since version v20.1.0-beta.1
---

## March 2, 2020

In addition to various updates, enhancements, and bug fixes, this v20.1 beta release includes the ability to **log slow SQL queries**. By setting the `sql.log.slow_query.latency_threshold` [cluster setting](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html), each node of your cluster will log queries that exceed the specified service latency to a new file called `cockroach-sql-slow.log`.

### Security updates

- Operators can now disable external HTTP access when performing certain operations (`BACKUP`, `IMPORT`, etc). The external HTTP access, as well as custom HTTP endpoints, are disabled by providing an `--external-io-disable-http` flag. This flag provides a light-weight option to disable external HTTP access in environments where running a full-fledged proxy server may not be feasible. If running a proxy server is acceptable, operators may choose to start the `cockroach` binary while specifying the `HTTP(S)_PROXY` environment variable. [#44900][#44900]

### General changes

- Added a slow query log facility to CockroachDB, configurable by setting the `sql.log.slow_query.latency_threshold` [cluster setting](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html). When used, each node of your cluster will record queries that exceed the specified service latency to a new file called `cockroach-sql-slow.log`. [#44816][#44816]
- New clusters will have a larger default range size of 512 MB, which will result in fewer ranges for the same amount of data. [#45209][#45209]

### Enterprise edition changes

- Row counts in `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` now include rows in system tables. [#44965][#44965]

### SQL language changes

- Disallowed changing the primary key of a table in the same transaction as its `CREATE TABLE` statement. [#44815][#44815]
- Introduced the ability to create views using `CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS`, which does nothing if the view already existed. [#44913][#44913]
- If temporary table creation is enabled, users now have the ability to create temporary sequences as well. [#44806][#44806]
- Added native support of hash-sharded indexes with new `USING HASH WITH BUCKET_COUNT = <n>` syntax for indices (including the primary index of a table). This feature allows users to easily relieve write hot-spots caused by sequential insert patterns at the cost of scan time for queries over the hashed dimension. [#42922][#42922]
- Added support for primary key changes into hash sharded indexes. [#44993][#44993]
- Disabled creating a hash sharded index that is also interleaved. [#44996][#44996]
- An `UPDATE` returning a serialization failure error (code `40001`) now leaves behind a lock, helping the transaction succeed if it retries. This prevents starvation of transactions where an `UPDATE` is prone to conflicts. [#44654][#44654]
- Added a builtin function `getdatabaseencoding()`, which returns the current encoding name used by the database. [#45129][#45129]
- The SQL:2008 syntax `OFFSET <x> ROWS` and `FETCH FIRST <y> ROWS ONLY` now accept parameter values. [#45112][#45112]
- Disallowed primary key changes on tables that are currently undergoing a primary key change. [#44784][#44784]
- Added support for the  aggregate function `corr()` [#44628][#44628]
- `INSERT..ON CONFLICT` index column names can now be specified in any order, rather than only in the same order as the index. [#45280][#45280]

### Command-line changes

- Previously, `cockroach debug zip` would only print an informational message about a piece of data it was retrieving *after* the data was retrieved (or an error was observed). This patch changes it to print a message beforehand as well. This enables better troubleshooting of hanging queries. [#44342][#44342]
- `cockroach debug zip` now properly supports special characters in database and table names. [#44342][#44342]
- `cockroach debug zip` will now apply [the `--timeout` parameter](../cockroach-node.html) to the SQL queries it performs (there was no timeout previously, causing `cockroach debug zip` to potentially hang). [#44342][#44342]
- `cockroach debug zip` is now able to tolerate more forms of cluster unavailability. Nonetheless, in case system ranges are unavailable, it is recommended to run `cockroach debug zip` towards each node address in turn to maximize the amount of useful data collected. [#44342][#44342]
- `cockroach debug zip` now includes secondary log files in the main log directory, for example the RocksDB logs. Log files in alternate log directories (e.g. `--sql-audit-dir`, if different from the main log directory) are not included. [#45200][#45200]

### Admin UI changes

- Changed Decommissioned Node History view to accommodate the case when there are no decommissioned nodes. [#44205][#44205]
- Changed styling of the Cluster Overview view. [#44212][#44212]
- Endpoint `/_status/registry/{node_id}` will now display status info about the jobs running on this `node_id`. [#45030][#45030]
- The "Log file list" endpoint now includes secondary log files in the main log directory, for example the RocksDB logs. Log files in alternate log directories (e.g. `--sql-audit-dir`, if different from the main log directory) are not included. [#45200][#45200]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could return an internal error on the queries that return `INT` columns when the default integer size has been changed. [#44930][#44930]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could crash when running `EXPLAIN (VEC)` in some edge cases. Now, an internal error is returned instead. [#44931][#44931]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would return an internal error when the merge join operation was performed via the vectorized execution engine in a case when two sides of the join had comparable but different types in the equality columns (for example, `INT2` on the left and `INT4` on the right). [#44942][#44942]
- Fixed internal query errors in some cases involving negative limits. [#45009][#45009]
- Fixed a bug where the distinct operation in the row execution engine would fail to properly account for its memory usage, potentially leading to OOMs on large tables. [#45254][#45254]
- Correctly handle Avro byte datums when converting them to the expected string column families (such as `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, etc). [#45242][#45242]
- Fixed a potential error occurring when loading the movr dataset with a large number of rows in the promo codes column. [#45035][#45035]

### Performance improvements

- The [cost-based-optimizer](../cost-based-optimizer.html) now generates faster execution plans in some cases that involve `IN` / `NOT IN` with an empty tuple (or `= ANY` with an empty array). [#45170][#45170]

### Doc updates

- Added a [tutorial for developing and deploying a multi-region web application](../v20.1/multi-region-overview.html) with Flask, SQLAlchemy, CockroachCloud, and Google Cloud Platform. [#5732][#5732]
- Added a [Developer Guide](../v20.1/developer-guide-overview.html) that shows how to do common application development tasks in several languages: Go, Java, and Python. [#6362][#6362]
- Added [information about how to access the Admin UI on secure clusters](../v20.1/admin-ui-overview.html). [#6640][#6640]
- Overhauled the documentation on [authorization](../v20.1/authorization.html), [roles](../v20.1/create-role.html), and [grants](../v20.1/grant.html). [#6332][#6332]
- Added docs for [troubleshooting node liveness](../v20.1/cluster-setup-troubleshooting.html). [#6322][#6322]
- Added docs for online primary key changes with [`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v20.1/alter-table.html). [#6513][#6513]
- Added a [tutorial for using PonyORM with CockroachDB](../v20.1/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-pony.html). [#6531][#6531]
- Added a [tutorial for using the jOOQ ORM with CockroachDB](../v20.1/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb-jooq.html). [#6684][#6684]
