### General Changes

- CockroachDB now uses Go 1.8. [#13673](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13673)
- CockroachDB now uses RocksDB 5.1.4. [#13831](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13831)

### SQL Language Changes

- Table names are now released as soon as the [`DROP TABLE`](../v1.0/drop-table.html) statement executes, instead of being held until the asynchronous cleanup finishes. [#13908](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13908)
- Most write statements now accept a `RETURNING NOTHING` clause to indicate that the query should not return a result (not even the number of rows affected). This will be used in the future to enable optimizations. [#13802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13802)
- PostgreSQL-style duration formats are now parsed case-insensitively. [#13748](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13748)
- Tables with no columns are now handled correctly in the network protocol. [#13765](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13765)
- `COPY` no longer requires the input data to end in a newline. [#13858](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13858)
- [`SHOW CONSTRAINTS`](../v1.0/show-constraints.html) no longer includes constraints involving hidden columns. [#13870](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13870)
- It is no longer possible to drop system tables. [#13911](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13911)
- The `DESC` modifier can now be applied to columns in a [`PRIMARY KEY`](../v1.0/primary-key.html) or [`UNIQUE`](../v1.0/unique.html) clause during table creation. [#13924](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13924)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- The [`cockroach dump`](../v1.0/sql-dump.html) command now takes an `--as-of` flag, which can be used to make a backup as of a particular time.
- When [starting a node](../v1.0/start-a-node.html), the details printed to `stdout` are now written to the node's `INFO` log as well. Also, these details now include node attributes and locality. [#1143](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/1143), [#1144](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/1144)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed (again) a bug in error handling that could causes ranges to get stuck if an error occurred during a rebalance. [#13763](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13763)
- Work around a bug that could cause GRPC connections to get stuck in a broken state. [#13822](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13822)
- Panic stack traces are now written to the `INFO` log file by default instead of to `stderr`. [#13890](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13890)

### Performance Improvements

- Improved performance in high-contention scenarios by introducing a queue to wait for conflicting transactions to finish. This also reduces the likelihood of transaction restarts due to write/write conflicts. [#13501](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13501)
- A new lease implementation is now used for most ranges, reducing the number of writes that must be done just to maintain a lease. [#13826](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13826)
- Reduced the occurrence of `AmbiguousResultError` by waiting for pending RPCs to complete before returning. [#13800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13800)
- Changed some mutexes to `RWMutexes`. Removed some instrumentation of mutex timing. [#13697](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13697)
- `cockroach dump` now works in larger batches. [#13812](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13812)
- Failed snapshots no longer disrupt regular raft messages. [#13816](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13816)
- Increased flow control parameters for GRPC connections, improving performance on high-latency links. [#13840](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13840)
- Increased limits on in-flight raft messages. [#13862](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13862)
- Range leases are now proactively transferred away from draining nodes. [#13792](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13792)
- Avoid sending redundant PushTxn calls in intent resolution. [#13955](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13955)

### Doc Updates

- Added an FAQ on [auto-generating unique IDs in CockroachDB](../v1.0/sql-faqs.html#how-do-i-auto-generate-unique-row-ids-in-cockroachdb). [#1126](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1126)
- Expanded guidance on [using a SQL table as an alternative to direct key-value access](../v1.0/frequently-asked-questions.html#can-i-use-cockroachdb-as-a-key-value-store). [#1122](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1122)
- Added details about [using the `BIT` type to constrain integers](../v1.0/int.html#size) based on their corresponding binary values. [#1116](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1116)
- Added details about [building a binary](../v1.0/install-cockroachdb.html) that excludes enterprise functionality covered by the CockroachDB Community License (CCL). [#1130](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1130)
