### General Changes

- The new `compactor.threshold_bytes` and `max_record_age` [cluster settings](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) can be used to configure the compactor. [#25458][#25458]
- The new `cluster.preserve_downgrade_option` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) makes it possible to preserve the option to downgrade after [performing a rolling upgrade to v2.1](../v2.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html). [#25811][#25811]

### SQL Language Changes

- Prevented [`DROP TABLE`](../v2.0/drop-table.html) from using too much CPU. [#25852][#25852]

### Command-Line Changes

- The [`cockroach sql`](../v2.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) command no longer prompts for a password when a certificate is provided. [#26232][#26232]
- The [`cockroach quit`](../v2.0/stop-a-node.html) command now prints warning messages to the standard error stream, not to standard output. [#26163][#26163]

### Bug Fixes

- Prevented the internal gossip network from being partitioned by making it much less likely that nodes in the network could forget about each other. [#25521][#25521]
- Prevented spurious `BudgetExceededErrors` for some queries that read a lot of JSON data from disk. [#25719][#25719]
- Fixed a crash in some cases when using a `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`. [#25654][#25654]
- Fixed a crash caused by inserting data into a table with [computed columns](../v2.0/computed-columns.html) that reference other columns that weren't present in the `INSERT` statement. [#25807][#25807]
- [`UPSERT`](../v2.0/upsert.html) is now properly able to write `NULL` values to every column in tables containing more than one [column family](../v2.0/column-families.html). [#26181][#26181]
- Fixed a bug where a long-running query running from one day to the next would not always produce the right value for `current_date()`. [#26413][#26413]
- Fixed a bug where [`cockroach quit`](../v2.0/stop-a-node.html) would erroneously fail even though the node already successfully shut down. [#26163][#26163]
- Rows larger than 8192 bytes are now supported by the "copy from" protocol. [#26641][#26641]
- Trying to "copy from stdin" into a table that doesn't exist no longer drops the connection. [#26641][#26641]
- Previously, expired compactions could stay in the queue forever. Now, they are removed when they expire. [#26659][#26659]

### Performance Improvements

- The performance impact of dropping a large table has been substantially reduced. [#26615][#26615]

### Doc Updates

- Documented [special syntax forms](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html#special-syntax-forms) of built-in SQL functions and [conditional and function-like operators](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html#conditional-and-function-like-operators), and updated the [SQL operator order of precedence](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html#operators). [#3192][#3192]
- Added best practices on [understanding and avoiding transaction contention](../v2.0/performance-best-practices-overview.html#understanding-and-avoiding-transaction-contention) and a related [FAQ](../v2.0/operational-faqs.html#why-would-increasing-the-number-of-nodes-not-result-in-more-operations-per-second). [#3156][#3156]
- Improved the documentation of [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v2.0/as-of-system-time.html). [#3155][#3155]
- Expanded the [manual deployment](../v2.0/manual-deployment.html) guides to cover running a sample workload against a cluster. [#3149][#3149]
- Added FAQs on [generating unique, slowly increasing sequential numbers](../v2.0/sql-faqs.html#how-do-i-generate-unique-slowly-increasing-sequential-numbers-in-cockroachdb) and [the differences between `UUID`, sequences, and `unique_rowid()`](../v2.0/sql-faqs.html#what-are-the-differences-between-uuid-sequences-and-unique_rowid). [#3104][#3104]
