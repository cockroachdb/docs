### New Features

- A prototype implementation of `JOIN` (non-optimized) is now available. [#7202](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7202)
- [Column Families](../v1.0/column-families.html) are a new, more efficient representation of SQL tables. Each column family is a group of columns in a table that are stored as a single underlying key-value pair. New tables created with multi-column families will not be compatible with versions of CockroachDB earlier than `beta-20160629`. However, no migration of existing tables is necessary; the previous format corresponds to a separate column family for each column in the table. [#7466](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7466), [#7408](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7408), [RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/sql_column_families.md)
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v1.0/explain.html) can now be used with `CREATE`, `DROP`, and `ALTER` statements. [#7269](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7269)
- The [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now prints tab-separated values instead of ASCII-art tables when `stdout` is not a TTY (unless `--pretty` is used). [#7268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7268)
- In interactive mode, the [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now prints the number of rows at the end of a result set. [#7266](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7266)
- Prepared statements can now be deallocated with the `DEALLOCATE` command. [#7367](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7367)
- Added support for interval types in placeholders. [#7382](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7382)
- Added support for hexadecimal-encoded [`STRING`](../v1.0/string.html) literals. [#7138](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7138)

### Performance Improvements

- The load balancing system now operates at a steadier pace, reducing spikes in memory usage and reaching equilibrium more quickly. [#7147](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7147)
- The block cache is now shared across stores on the same node. [#7496](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7496)
- Initial replication in a new cluster is now significantly faster. [#7355](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7355)
- The Raft log is now more aggressively truncated. [#7125](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7125)
- The RocksDB block-size is now set to a more reasonable value. [#7276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7276) 
- A new reservation system now ensures that there is enough free space and not too many existing reservations before trying to replicate a range to a new store. This stops the thundering herd that can occur when adding a new node to a cluster. [#7147](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7147)
- Miscellaneous performance improvements in the underlying data distribution and replication protocol.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug that could cause a server crash on startup. [#7447](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7447)
- Improved the handling of `NULL` values in arithmetic and comparison operations. [#7341](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7341)
- Fixed a crash when session arguments could not be parsed. [#7231](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7231)
- Improved error messages for parts of the PostgreSQL protocol we do not support. [#7233](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7233)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` can now be used in prepared statements. [#7251](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7251)
- Raft messages are no longer canceled due to unrelated errors. [#7252](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7252)
- [Constraint](../v1.0/constraints.html) names that are specified at the column level are now preserved. [#7271](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7271)
- When [`COMMIT`](../v1.0/commit-transaction.html) returns an error, the transaction is considered closed and a separate `ROLLBACK` is no longer necessary. [#7282](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7282)
- The [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) now escapes strings in a format that the SQL parser will accept. [#7294](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7294)
- Fixed issues when two snapshots were being sent simultaneously. [#7299](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7299)
- When a column is [renamed](../v1.0/rename-column.html), any `CHECK` constraints referring to that column are now updated. [#7311](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7311)
- When piping commands into the [built-in SQL client](../v1.0/use-the-built-in-sql-client.html), the last line was previously ignored. Now it will be executed if it ends with a semicolon, or report an error if it is non-empty but not a complete statement. [#7328](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7328)
- When [`cockroach quit`](../v1.0/stop-a-node.html) fails to drain a node, it is now forced to quit. [#7483](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7483)
- Fixed a case in which a removed replica could prevent the rebalance queue from making progress. [#7507](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7507)
- Fixed a bug that slowed down population of new replicas. [#7252](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7252)

### Internal Changes

- The Admin UI has been rewritten in a new framework. [#7242](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7242)
- The Admin UI now uses serialized protocol buffers when communicating with CockroachDB servers. [#7178](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7178), [#7242](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7242)
