### Bug fixes

- Fixed crashes when trying to run certain `SHOW` commands via the pgwire prepare path. [#37891][#37891]
- Fixed a rare crash ("close of closed channel") that would occur when shutting down a server. [#37893][#37893]
- Previously, due to a bug when estimating result set sizes in the [Optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html), queries involving large `INT` ranges could result in poor plans being generated. [#38039][#38039]
- `NULL`s are now correctly handled by `MIN`, `SUM`, and `AVG` when used as [window functions](../v2.1/window-functions.html). [#38357][#38357]
- Prevented a possible missing row from queries that involved iterator reuse and seeking into the gap between stables bridged by a range tombstone. [#37694][#37694]

### Security improvements

- Only check `CommonName` on first certificate in file. [#38166][#38166]
- Stack memory used by CockroachDB is now marked as non-executable, improving security and compatibility with SELinux. [#38134][#38134]
