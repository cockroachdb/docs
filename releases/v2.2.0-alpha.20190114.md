### Backward-incompatible changes

- We are changing the way in which composite foreign key matches are evaluated. A composite foreign key is a key with more than one column in it.  Up until now, we've claimed that our composite keys were matched using the `MATCH FULL` method, which was almost correct. For all matching methods, there are two categories. Keys that are 3 types of keys:  * valid - keys that can be used for matching foreign key relationships * invalid - keys that will not be used for matching * unacceptable - keys that cannot be inserted at all  If a key is not valid for matching, it will not be affected by any foreign key checking and is allowed to violate the relationship.  MATCH FULL stipulates that valid keys can have no NULL values. And invalid keys must have all NULL values. Keys with any combination of both values and NULLs cannot are unacceptable.  Until now, we allowed explicit NULL values if there was a corresponding NULL value. This was incorrect.  Of course, this can easily be corrected, but not without possibly making some foreign key relationships invalid. To fix this, all matches going forward will now use the MATCH SIMPLE method.  MATCH SIMPLE stipulates that valid keys have no NULL.  Invalid keys are ones with one or more NULLs instead of the stricter no-NULLs allowed from MATCH FULL. So now the presence of a single NULL will mean that the key will not attempt to be matched in foreign key constraint relationships, including cascading operations.  Please note that this now is same as the default Postgres matching method. There is a chance that if your schema currently uses composite keys that this may change your foreign key constraints and cascading so please inspect them. [#32693][#32693]
- Mutation statements like `UPDATE` and `INSERT` no longer attempt to guarantee mutation or output ordering when an `ORDER BY` clause is present. It is now an error to use `ORDER BY` without `LIMIT` with the `UPDATE` statement. [#33087][#33087] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- Added support for configuring authentication via an `hba.conf` [cluster setting](../v2.2/cluster-settings.html). [#32892][#32892] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for collecting table statistics on a default set of columns by calling `CREATE STATISTICS` with no columns specified. [#32981][#32981] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added the `default_int_size` [session variable](../v2.2/set-vars.html) and `sql.defaults.default_int_size` [cluster setting](../v2.2/cluster-settings.html) to control how the `INT` and `SERIAL` types are interpreted. The default value, `8`, causes these types to be interpreted as aliases for `INT8` and `SERIAL8`, which have been the historical defaults for CockroachDB.  PostgreSQL clients that expect `INT` and `SERIAL` to be 32-bit values can set `default_int_size` to `4`, which will cause `INT` and `SERIAL` to be aliases for `INT4` and `SERIAL4`. Please note that due to issue [#32846](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/32846), `SET default_int_size` does not take effect until the next statement batch is executed. [#32848][#32848] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- When creating a [replication zone](../v2.2/configure-replication-zones.html), if a field is set to `COPY FROM PARENT`, the field now inherits its value from its parent zone, but any change to the field in the parent zone no longer affects the child zone. [#32861][#32861] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Cockroach now supports specifying the matching method for composite [foreign keys](../v2.2/foreign-key.html) (a foreign key that includes more than one column) as either `MATCH SIMPLE` or `MATCH FULL`. `MATCH SIMPLE` remains the default. `MATCH FULL` differs from `MATCH SIMPLE` by not allowing the mixing of `NULL` and non-`NULL` values. Only all `NULL` values will not be used to validate a foreign key constraint check or cascading action. `MATCH PARTIAL` is still not supported.  For more details see issue [#20305](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/20305) or https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-createtable.html. [#32998][#32998] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `string_agg()` aggregate function is now supported by the [cost-based optimizer](../v2.2/cost-based-optimizer.html). [#33172][#33172]
- Shift operators on integers now always operate on explicit types instead of possibly an untyped constant. They also now return an error if the right-side operand is out of range. [#33221][#33221]
- Added support for the `pg_catalog` introspection table `pg_am` for both versions 9.5 and 9.6, which changed the table significantly. [#33252][#33252]
- Added foreign key checks to kv traces. [#33328][#33328]
- CockroachDB now defines columns `domain_catalog`, `domain_schema` and `domain_name` in `information_schema.columns` (using `NULL` values, since domain types are not yet supported) for compatibility with PostgreSQL clients. [#33267][#33267]
- Attempts to use some PostgreSQL built-in functions that are not yet supported in CockroachDB now cause a clearer error message, and also become reported in [diagnostics reporting](../v2.2/diagnostics-reporting.html), if diagnostics reporting is enabled, so as to gauge demand. [#33390][#33390]
- CockroachDB now reports the name (not the value) of unsupported client parameters passed when setting up new SQL sessions in [diagnostics reporting](../v2.2/diagnostics-reporting.html), if diagnostics reporting is enabled, to guage demand for additional support. [#33264][#33264]
- CockroachDB now collects statistics for statements executed "internally" (for system purposes). This is meant to facilitate performance troubleshooting. [#32215][#32215]
- CockroachDB now supports associating comments to SQL databases using PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON DATABASE` syntax. This also provides proper support for pg's `pg_catalog.pg_description` and the `obj_description()` built-in function. [#33057][#33057] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now supports associating comments to SQL table columns using PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON COLUMN` syntax. This also provides proper support for pg's `pg_catalog.pg_description` and the `col_description()` built-in function. [#33355][#33355] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Logical plans are now sampled and stored in [statement statistics](../v2.2/show-statistics.html). [#33020][#33020] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`SHOW EXPERIMENTAL_RANGES`](../v2.2/show-experimental-ranges.html) is faster if no columns are requested from it, like in `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [SHOW EXPERIMENTAL_RANGES...]`. [#33463][#33463]
- The new `experimental_optimizer_updates` [cluster setting](../v2.2/cluster-settings.html) controls whether `UPDATE` and `UPSERT` statements are planned by the cost-based optimizer rather than the heuristic planner. Also note that when the setting is set, check constraints are not checked for rows skipped by the `INSERT ... DO NOTHING` clause. [#33339][#33339] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Admin UI changes

- The [**Statement Details**](../v2.2/admin-ui-statements-page.html) page now shows sample logical plans for each unique fingerprint. [#33483][#33483]
- SQL queries issued internally by CockroachDB are now visible on the [**Statements**](../v2.2/admin-ui-statements-page.html) page. They can be filtered using the application name. [#32215][#32215]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where schema changes could get stuck for 5 minutes when executed immediately after a server restart. [#32988][#32988]
- Fixed a bug with returning dropped unique columns in `DELETE` statements with `RETURNING`. [#33438][#33438]
- Fixed a bug that could cause under-replication or unavailability in 5-node clusters and those using high replication factors. [#32949][#32949]
- Fixed an infinite loop in a low-level scanning routine that could be hit in unusual circumstances. [#33063][#33063]
- CockroachDB no longer reports under-replicated ranges corresponding to replicas that are waiting to be deleted. [#32845][#32845]
- Fixed a possible goroutine leak when canceling queries. [#33130][#33130]
- `CHANGEFEED`s and incremental `BACKUP`s no longer indefinitely hang under an infrequent condition. [#32909][#32909]
- `cockroach node status --ranges` previously listed the count of under-replicated ranges in the `ranges_unavailable` column and the number of unavailable ranges in the `ranges_underreplicated` column. This fixes that mix-up. [#32950][#32950]
- Fixed a panic in the cost-based optimizer during the planning of some queries. [#33183][#33183]
- Cancel requests (via the pgwire protocol) now close quickly with an EOF instead of hanging but still don't cancel the request. [#33202][#33202]
- CockroachDB does not crash upon running `SHOW SESSIONS`, `SHOW QUERIES`, and inspections of some `crdb_internal` tables when certain SQL sessions are issuing internal SQL queries. [#33138][#33138]
- Updated the Zipkin library to avoid deadlock when stopping Zipkin tracing. [#33287][#33287]
- Fixed a panic that could result from not supplying a nullable column in an `INSERT ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` statement. [#33245][#33245]
- Fixed pgwire binary decoding of decimal `NaN` and `NULL` in arrays. [#33295][#33295]
- The `UPSERT` and `INSERT ON CONFLICT` statements now properly check that the user has the `SELECT` privilege on the target table. [#33358][#33358]
- CockroachDB now errors with a fatal exit when data or logging partitions become unresponsive. Previously, the process would remain running, though in an unresponsive state. [#32978][#32978]
- Updated the contextual help for `\h EXPORT` in `cockroach sql` to reflect the actual syntax of the statement. [#33460][#33460]
- `INSERT ON CONFLICT ... DO NOTHING` no longer ignores rows that appear to be duplicate in the `INSERT` operands but are not yet present in the table. These are now properly inserted. [#33320][#33320]
- Prevented a panic with certain queries that use the statement source (square bracket) syntax. [#33537][#33537]

### Performance improvements

- Cross-range disjunctive scans where the result size can be deduced are now automatically parallelized. [#31616][#31616]
- Limited the concurrency of `BACKUP` on nodes with fewer cores to reduce performance impact. [#33277][#33277]
- Index joins, lookup joins, foreign key checks, cascade scans, zig zag joins, and `UPSERT`s no longer needlessly scan over child interleaved tables when searching for keys. [#33350][#33350]

### Doc updates

- Updated the [Production Checklist](../v2.2/recommended-production-settings.html) with more current hardware recommendations and additional guidance on storage, file systems, and clock synch. [#4153](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4153)
- Expanded the [SQLAlchemy tutorial](../v2.2/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-sqlalchemy.html) to provide code for transaction retries and best practices for using SQLAlchemy with CockroachDB. [#4142](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4142)
- Added [geo-partitioning](../v2.2/training/geo-partitioning.html), [Kubernetes](../v2.2/training/orchestration-with-kubernetes.html), and [TPC-C benchmarking](../v2.2/training/performance-benchmarking.html) modules to the intro to CockroachDB training.
