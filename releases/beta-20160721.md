### New Features

- Metrics are now exported on `/_status/vars` in a format suitable for aggregation by Prometheus. [#7895](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7895)

### Build Changes

- Go 1.6.3 and 1.7rc2 are now supported. [#7811](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7811)
- The versions of Docker built for Mac and Windows are now supported. Users of a `docker-machine` VM may need to set environment variables by hand as this case is no longer detected automatically. [#7820](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7820)

### UI Changes

- The Admin UI now displays a warning when there are fewer than three nodes. [#7783](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7783)

### Performance Improvements

- Writes to different ranges are now performed in parallel. [#7860](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7860)
- The first range descriptor is kept more up-to-date. [#7766](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7766)
- Ranges are now considered for splits after any replication or rebalancing change. [#7800](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7800)
- An existing table lease can now be reused without writing to the lease table as long as it has enough time left before expiration. [#7781](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7781)
- The rebalancing system now avoids moving the current leader of a range. [#7918](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7918)
- Transaction records related to splits are now garbage-collected promptly. [#7903](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7903)

### Bug Fixes

- The [`cockroach dump`](../v1.0/sql-dump.html) command now works with tables that have [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) columns that specify a precision and scale. [#7842](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7842)
- Fixed several panics when handling invalid SQL commands. [#7867](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7867) [#7868](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7868)
- [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) now supports the `IF NOT EXISTS` modifier. [#7898](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7898)
- Fixed a race in gossip status logging. [#7836](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7836)

### Doc Updates

- Feedback can now be submitted from the bottom of any page of our docs. [#467](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/467)

- Updated [INTERVAL](../v1.0/interval.html) to cover all supported interval formats: Golang, Traditional Postgres, and ISO 8601. [#462](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/462)
- Updated [Start a Cluster in Docker](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker.html) to work for Docker on Windows. [#457](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/457)
