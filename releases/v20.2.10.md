### SQL language changes

- Added the `INCLUDE_DEPRECATED_INTERLEAVES` option to [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html). In v21.1, this option must be specified when backing up a cluster, database, or table that includes [interleaved data](../v20.2/interleave-in-parent.html). [#64688][#64688]
- Added the `chunk_size` option to [`EXPORT CSV`](../v20.2/export.html) to control the target CSV file size. [#65009][#65009]

### Command-line changes

- The `--help` text for [`--max-disk-temp-storage`](../v20.2/cockroach-start.html#flags) now properly reports the default value. [#55055][#55055]

### DB Console changes

- Implemented a new library for line graphs that renders metrics more efficiently. Customers with large clusters (above ~30 nodes) can now load and interact with the [metrics dashboards](../v20.2/ui-overview-dashboard.html) much faster than before. [#64493][#64493]
- A legend is now shown underneath a timeseries graph if more than 10 series are being displayed. [#64493][#64493]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a race condition where read-write requests during replica removal (for example, during range merges or rebalancing) could be evaluated on the removed replica. These cases would not result in data being written to persistent storage, but could result in errors that should not have been returned. [#64601][#64601]
- Fixed a stack overflow that could happen in some corner cases involving partial indexes with predicates containing `(x IS NOT NULL)`. [#64739][#64739]
- Building no longer depends on internet access. Only vendored modules are used. This bug was introduced in v20.2.0. [#64507][#64507]
- Limit scans are no longer counted as full scans. [#64852][#64852]
- Providing a constant value as an [`ORDER BY`](../v20.2/order-by.html) value in an ordered set aggregate, such as `percentile_dist` or `percentile_cont`, no longer errors. This bug has been present since order set aggregates were added in v20.2.0. [#64903][#64903]
