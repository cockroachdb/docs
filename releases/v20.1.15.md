### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where [incremental cluster backups](../v20.1/backup-and-restore.html) may have missed data written to tables while they were `OFFLINE`. In practice this can happen if a [`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html) or [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html) was running across incremental backups. [#63494][#63494]
- Fixed a bug where [cluster restore](../v20.1/backup-and-restore.html) would sometimes (very rarely) fail after retrying. [#63773][#63773]
- Fixed a bug where some of the writes of the jobs while they were running may have been missed by the backup. [`IMPORT`](../v20.1/import.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html) jobs are now restored as reverting so that they cleanup after themselves.  [#63773][#63773]
- Fixed a rare issue that caused [replica divergence](../v20.1/architecture/replication-layer.html). When it occurred, it was reported by the replica consistency checker, typically within 24 hours of occurrence, which would terminate the nodes. [#63475][#63475]
