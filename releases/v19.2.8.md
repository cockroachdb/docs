### Docker image

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~shell
$ docker pull cockroachdb/cockroach-unstable:v19.2.8
~~~


### Security updates

- HTTP endpoints beginning with `/debug/` now require a valid [`admin`](../v19.2/authorization.html) login session. [#50489][#50489]

### SQL language changes

- The `pg_database` table in `pg_catalog` no longer requires privileges on any database in order for the data to be visible. [#48766][#48766]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where [`cockroach dump`](../v19.2/cockroach-dump.html) on a table with collated strings would omit the collation clause for the data insertion statements. [#48833][#48833]
- Manually writing a `NULL` value into the `system.users` table for the "hashedPassword" column will no longer cause a server crash during user authentication. [#48837][#48837]
- Fixed a memory leak which could affect [changefeeds](../v19.2/change-data-capture.html) performing scans of large tables. [#49162][#49162]
- Previously, when the value passed to `--drain-wait` was very small, but non-zero, [`cockroach quit`](../v19.2/cockroach-quit.html) in certain cases would not proceed to perform a hard shutdown. This has been corrected. This bug was present in v19.1.9, v19.2.7, and v20.1.1. [#49364][#49364]
- Previously, some benign errors were reported as unexpected internal errors by the [vectorized execution engine](../v19.2/vectorized-execution.html). This is now fixed. [#49535][#49535]
- Fixed a bug causing file descriptors to be leaked during GSS authentication. [#49655][#49655]
- Casting to width-limited strings now works correctly for strings containing Unicode characters. [#50160][#50160]
- Fixed cases in which casting a string to a width-limited string array was not truncating the string. [#50169][#50169]
- Fixed a RocksDB bug that could result in inconsistencies in rare circumstances. [#50498][#50498]

### Performance improvements

- Improved the [optimizer](../v19.2/cost-based-optimizer.html)'s estimation of the selectivity of some filters involving a disjunction (`OR`) of predicates over multiple columns. This results in more accurate cardinality estimation and enables the optimizer to choose better query plans in some cases. [#50473][#50473]

### Build changes

- Release Docker images are now built on Debian 9.12. [#50481][#50481]

### Doc updates

- Updated guidance on [node decommissioning](../v19.2/remove-nodes.html). [#7304][#7304]
- Renamed "whitelist/blacklist" terminology to "allowlist/blocklist". [#7535][#7535]
- Updated the Releases navigation in the sidebar to expose the latest Production and Testing releases. [#7550][#7550]
- Fixed scrollbar visibility on Chrome. [#7487][#7487]
