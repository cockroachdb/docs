### Enterprise edition changes

- Added support for standard HTTP proxy environment variables in HTTP and S3 storage. [#34535][#34535] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- It is now possible to force a reverse scan of a specific index using `table@{FORCE_INDEX=index,DESC}`. [#34121][#34121] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The value of `information_schema.columns.character_maximum_column` is set to `NULL` for all integer types, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#34201][#34201] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Command-line changes

- Fixed a bug in [`cockroach node status`](../v2.1/view-node-details.html) that prevented it from displaying down nodes in the cluster in some circumstances. [#34503][#34503]

### Bug fixes

- Lookup joins now properly preserve their input order even if more than one row of the input corresponds to the same row of the lookup table. [#33730][#33730]
- Fixed a goroutine leak that would occur while a cluster was unavailable (or a subset of nodes partitioned away from the cluster) and would cause a resource spike to resolve. [#34144][#34144]
- Fixed panics or incorrect results in some cases when grouping on constant columns (either with `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT ON`). [#34168][#34168]
- The values reported in `information_schema.columns` for integer columns created prior to CockroachDB v2.1 as `BIT` are now fixed and consistent with other integer types. [#34201][#34201]
- Fixed a bug that would delay Raft log truncations. [#34284][#34284]
- Prevented down-replicating widely replicated ranges when nodes in the cluster are temporarily down. [#34199][#34199]
- CockroachDB now enables re-starting a node at an address previously allocated for another node. [#34198][#34198]
- [`CHANGEFEED`](../v2.1/create-changefeed.html)s now can be started on tables that have been backfilled by schema changes. [#34362][#34362]
- Fixed a back up in flow creation observed by "no inbound stream connection" caused by not releasing a lock before attempting a possibly blocking operation. [#34364][#34364]
- Fixed a panic when updating a job that doesn't exist. [#34672][#34672]
- Fixed a bug in [`RESTORE`](../v2.1/restore.html) that prevented restoring some [`BACKUP`](../v2.1/backup.html)s containing previously dropped or truncated interleaved tables. [#34719][#34719]
- The value of the `attnum` column in `pg_catalog.pg_attribute` now remains stable across column drops. [#34734][#34734]
- Prevented a problem that would cause the Raft log to grow very large, which in turn could prevent replication changes. [#34774][#34774]
- Prevented down nodes from obstructing Raft log truncation on ranges they are a member of. This problem could cause replication to fail due to an overly large Raft log. [#34774][#34774]
- Fixed a bug that would incorrectly cause JSON field access equality comparisons to be true when they should be false. [#32214][#32214]

### Performance improvements

- Index joins, lookup joins, foreign key checks, cascade scans, zig zag joins, and `UPSERT`s no longer needlessly scan over child interleaved tables when searching for keys. [#33652][#33652]

### Doc updates

- Updated the [SQL Performance Best Practices](../v2.1/performance-best-practices-overview.html#interleave-tables) with caveats around interleaving tables. [#4273](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4273)
- Added a note that when a table that was previously [split](../v2.1/split-at.html) is truncated, the table must be pre-split again. [#4274](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4274)
- Added guidance on [removing `UNIQUE` constraints](../v2.1/constraints.html#remove-constraints). [#4276](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4276)
- Added a [warning about cross-store rebalancing](../v2.1/start-a-node.html#store) not working as expected in 3-node clusters with multiple stores per node. [#4320](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4320)
