### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- The `ALTER TABLE SPLIT AT` syntax has changed to support multiple splits with one command. Existing uses of `ALTER TABLE t SPLIT AT (x, y)` should be changed to `ALTER TABLE t SPLIT AT VALUES (x, y)`. [#14281](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14281)

### Installation Changes

- The Homebrew formula has moved; to install CockroachDB with `brew`, use `brew install cockroachdb/cockroach/cockroach`.

### General Changes

- CockroachDB now uses `jemalloc` version 4.5.0. [#14287](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14287)

### SQL Language Changes

- [Collated strings](../v1.0/collate.html) are now fully supported and may be stored in columns. [#13609](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13609)
- The new `isnan()` [function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) and special syntax `IS NAN` and `IS NOT NAN` can be used to detect floats that are `Not-a-Number`. [#14248](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14248)
- Variance and standard deviation calculations for integers and decimals now use additional precision internally. [#14013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14013)
- Decimals with precisions greater than 16 now work correctly. [#14304](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14304)
- [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v1.0/create-table-as.html) now works properly with NULL values. [#14247](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14247)
- The `SHOW application_name` statement is now supported. [#14085](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14085)
- CockroachDB now reports its version in two new places so that clients can distinguish CockroachDB from PostgreSQL: in the `crdb_version` variable in the network handshake, and in a new table `crdb_internal.build_info`. [#14145](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14145)
- `ALTER TABLE SPLIT AT` no longer reports an error if the table is already split at the designated point. [#14273](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14273)
- Casts involving OID and `regclass` types now behave more consistently with PostgreSQL. The `oid()` function is now available. [#13965](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13965) [#14022](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14022) [#14115](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14115) [#14260](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14260)
- Placeholder syntax may now be used for OID values. [#14255](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14255)
- Types with modifiers can now be cast to `::regtype`. [#14030](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14030)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- A new command `cockroach gen haproxy` is now available to generate an `haproxy` configuration file that can be used to access the cluster. [#14205](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14205)
- The [`cockroach start`](../v1.0/start-a-node.html) command now supports a `--pid-file` flag, which names a file to which the process ID will be written when the server is ready to handle requests. [#13996](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13996)
- If any environment variables used by `cockroach` are set but cannot be parsed, this is now treated as a fatal error. [#14124](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14124)

### Admin UI Changes

- The log view now shows logs for the requested node. [#13947](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13947)
- The custom time range selector now uses UTC to match the graphs. [#14007](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14007)
- The admin UI now uses relative paths for all links and respects cookies, allowing it to be run behind authenticating proxies. [#14039](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14039)
- The guideline displayed when hovering over a graph is now positioned correctly. [#14008](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14008)

### Bug Fixes

- [`UPSERT`](../v1.0/upsert.html) statements no longer incorrectly produce the error "cannot affect row a second time". [#10478](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10478)
- The replica allocator now explicitly recognizes when a node's health is unknown, and avoids situations in which a range could become critically under-replicated. [#14206](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14206)
- Fixed a problem with transaction conflicts immediately after a split that could cause 100% CPU usage. [#14305](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14305)
- The rebalancing system is better able to move replicas to match requested constraints. [#13973](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13973)
- Fixed a race that could lead to a panic when replicas are being moved frequently. [#14306](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14306)
- [`SHOW TABLES`](../v1.0/show-tables.html) no longer fails while a table is being dropped. [#14278](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14278)
- Fixed a crash in some [`EXPLAIN`](../v1.0/explain.html) statements. [#14244](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14244)
- [Name resolution](../v1.0/sql-name-resolution.html) no longer fails if non-existent databases are present in the search path. [#14006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14006)
- Logging of "node joined the cluster" events for the UI is more reliable. [#14179](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14179)
- Memory accounting on macOS now correctly reports memory allocated by C code. [#14287](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14287)

### Performance Improvements

- Range leases are now transferred to the replica closest to the source of load, when possible. This improves performance in geographically-distributed clusters. [#14268](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14268)
- The replica allocator will now actively attempt to move replicas away from no-longer-valid placements when the [zone configuration](../v1.0/configure-replication-zones.html) changes. [#14106](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14106)
- Improved the performance of write-heavy workloads. [#14138](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14138)
- Improved caching of range descriptors. [#14217](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14217)
- Reduced overhead in the command queue. [#13982](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/13982)
- CockroachDB now enables TCP keepalives on its sockets, improving responsiveness to clients that have disappeared (or load balancers with short timeouts). [#14063](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14063)
- Index backfill now only reads the columns necessary to perform the backfill. [#14271](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/14271)

### Doc Updates

- Expanded the tutorial on [orchestrating CockroachDB with Docker Swarm](../v1.0/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-docker-swarm.html) to cover both secure and insecure clusters. [#1184](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1184)
- Added guidance on [importing data from PostgreSQL](../v1.0/import-data.html#import-from-postgresql-dump). [#1200](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1200)
- Added OS-specific instructions for [starting a local CockroachDB cluster in Docker](../v1.0/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker.html). [#1167](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1167)
- Improved the [install from binary instructions](../v1.0/install-cockroachdb.html) to include moving the binary into the `PATH`. [#1196](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/1196)
