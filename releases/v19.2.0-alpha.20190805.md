### Enterprise edition changes

- Added a `skip_missing_views` option for [`RESTORE`](../v19.2/restore.html) to skip restoring views which cannot be restored because their dependencies are not being restored at the same time. [#38597][#38597]

### SQL language changes

- Added support for a table reader that performs a loose index scan over the underlying table. The index scan table reader uses information about the index being scanned to skip unnecessary rows while scanning the table, allowing for some optimizations to be used for some types of queries. [#38216][#38216]
- Enabled automatic detection of compression schemes on filenames in [`IMPORT`](../v19.2/import.html) that have parameters after the path. [#38521][#38521]
- Added `check_constraints` table to the `information_schema` database. [#38545][#38545]
- Added vectorized support for the `IN` selection operator. [#38546][#38546]
- Made some `pgwire` error codes for binary parameter decoding better match Postgres. [#38365][#38365]
- Added support for projection of the `IN` operator. [#38613][#38613]
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.2/explain.html) returns more information about lookup joins. [#38748][#38748]
- The first statement of a transaction will no longer return a transaction retry error if it is an [`UPDATE`](../v19.2/update.html) or [`DELETE`](../v19.2/delete.html) (this was already true for [`INSERT`](../v19.2/insert.html)). [#38668][#38668]
- Non-fatal errors updating jobs while [dropping a table](../v19.2/drop-table.html) are now ignored. [#38617][#38617]
- Added support for `NOT VALID` option for [Foreign Key constraints](../v19.2/foreign-key.html). [#38663][#38663]
- Added [cluster setting](../v19.2/set-cluster-setting.html) `sql.stats.histogram_collection.enabled` to enable collection of histograms during statistics collection. [#38812][#38812]
- [Common Table Expressions](../v19.2/common-table-expressions.html) (CTEs) may now be referenced from multiple locations in a query. [#38670][#38670]
- [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v19.2/create-table-as.html) now allows user-defined primary keys and column families. [#38904][#38904], [#38589][#38589]
- [`EXPLAIN (OPT,ENV)`](../v19.2/explain.html) now returns a URL with the data encoded in the fragment portion. Opening the URL shows a page with the decoded data. Note that the data is processed in the local browser session and is never sent out. [#38973][#38973]

### Command-line changes

- [`cockroach dump`](../v19.2/cockroach-dump.html) will now more clearly refer to issue [37768](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/37768) when it encounters a table with no visible columns, which (currently) cannot be dumped successfully. [#38725][#38725]
- CockroachDB now requires square brackets to specify IPv6 addresses in `--join`, `--host`, `--listen-addr` and similar [flags](../v19.2/cockroach-start.html#flags), for example `--listen-addr=[::1]`. The syntax without square brackets had been deprecated since CockroachDB 2.1. [#38924][#38924]

### Admin UI changes

- Dashboard [graphs](../v19.2/admin-ui-overview.html) now offer a "Last 2 days" option in the time selector. [#38852][#38852]
- Corrected the units displayed for the `MVCC Intent Age` and the `MVCC GC Bytes Age` fields in the Range Status page. [#38283][#38283]

### Bug fixes

- The `ALTER PARTITION x OF INDEX y CONFIGURE ZONE USING` syntax no longer erroneously modifies the entire index's [zone configuration](../v19.2/configure-zone.html). [#38423][#38423]
- Fixed an issue that prevented restoring some backups if they included tables that were partitioned by columns of a certain types while also interleaved by child tables. [#38341][#38341]
- Restoring multi-line CLI histories in the SQL shell no longer produces terminal anomalies when the cursor is on the last line of the screen. [#38505][#38505]
- Fixed a panic where generators in an aggregate function were not appropriately rejected. [#38554][#38554]
- Handled `database_name` and composite primary key for `UNSPLIT ALL`. [#38338][#38338]
- Ranges consisting of only one row (and historical versions of that row) are now correctly up-replicating. [#38529][#38529]
- Nodes that have been down now recover more quickly when they rejoin, assuming they weren't down for much more than the value of the `server.time_until_store_dead` [cluster setting](../v19.2/set-cluster-setting.html) (which defaults to 5 minutes). [#38484][#38484]
- [`cockroach sqlfmt`](../v19.2/cockroach-sqlfmt.html#flags) no longer strips `ORDER BY` from aggregates. [#38623][#38623]
- Corrected issue that caused certain plans that contained both offsets and limits to return more rows than desired. [#38667][#38667]
- Fixed a bug that prevented [inverted indexes](../v19.2/inverted-indexes.html) from being created on JSON columns containing `NULL` values. [#38738][#38738]
- Transaction retries in [schema changes](../v19.2/online-schema-changes.html) are again handled correctly. [#38668][#38668]
- On macOS, the server process can once again start in environments where the `kern.maxfilesperproc` sysctl has been lowered. [#38472][#38472]
- Fixed a bug where [dropping an index](../v19.2/drop-index.html) that a foreign key depends on could cause an inconsistent table state if the schema change were rolled back. [#38783][#38783]
- Fixed an issue where [Cost-based optimizer](../v19.2/cost-based-optimizer.html)-planned upserts that used [lookup join](../v19.2/joins.html#lookup-joins) that were run during column mutations on the table being upserted into could cause crashes or other issues. [#38637][#38637]
- Fixed incorrect results, or "unordered span" errors, in some cases involving exclusive inequalities with non-numeric types. [#38880][#38880]
- Prevented OOM conditions during lookup joins between tables with a very large n:1 relationship. [#38837][#38837]
- `sum_int()` now errors on overflow instead of silently wrapping. [#38921][#38921]
- Fixed bug in the optimizer causing a bad index for lookup join in some cases. [#39016][#39016]
- Backfills are no longer performed when a user explicitly sets the default value of a new column to be `NULL`. [#38910][#38910]

### Performance improvements

- Introduced new concurrent Raft proposal buffer, which increases the degree of write concurrency supported on a single range. [#38343][#38343]
- Grow stack prior to decoding grpc BatchRequest messages. [#38107][#38107]
- Batched raft entry application and coalesce writes to applied state for the batch. [#38568][#38568]
- Improved performance of the [`BACKUP`](../v19.2/backup.html) process. [#37887][#37887]

### Build changes

- Building CockroachDB from source now requires node version 10. This was previously implicitly required. Now the requirement is explicit. [#38955][#38955]
- Building CockroachDB from source now requires Go 1.12 or higher. [#38379][#38379]

### Doc updates

- Expanded single-region Kubernetes [tutorial](../v19.2/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) to cover running on Amazonâ€™s hosted EKS. [#5063](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5063)
- [Build an App with CockroachDB](../v19.2/build-an-app-with-cockroachdb.html) examples now include [C++](../v19.2/build-a-c++-app-with-cockroachdb.html) and [Clojure](../v19.2/build-a-clojure-app-with-cockroachdb.html) application examples for secure clusters. In addition, the client-side transaction logic has been updated in the [Java](../v19.2/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html), [Python](../v19.2/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb.html), and [Go](../v19.2/build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb.html) code examples. [#5028](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5028), [#5084](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5084), [#5085](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5085), [#5088](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5088)
- Updated [Common Errors](../v19.2/common-errors.html) document with specific error strings to aid user searches. [#5033](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/#5033)
- Documented a [known limitation](../v19.2/known-limitations.html) about hanged requests to a restarted node that needs Raft snapshots. [#5018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5018)
- Updated the [`BACKUP`](../v19.2/backup.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v19.2/restore.html) docs to specify that the `system.users` table is not included with a backup. To restore the table, you must explicitly include it. [#5072](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/5072)
