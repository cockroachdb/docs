### Bug fixes

- Fixed a race condition where read-write requests during replica removal (for example, during range merges or rebalancing) could be evaluated on the removed replica. These cases would not result in data being written to persistent storage, but could result in errors that should not have been returned. [#64604][#64604]
- Fixed a bug where users of OSS builds of CockroachDB would see "Page Not Found" when loading the DB Console. [#64126][#64126]
