### SQL Language Changes

- [`CHECK`](../v2.0/check.html) constraints are now checked when updating a conflicting row in [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v2.0/insert.html#update-values-on-conflict) statements. [#26699][#26699] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- An error is now returned to the user instead of panicking when trying to add a column with a [`UNIQUE`](../v2.0/unique.html) constraint when that column's type is not indexable. [#26728][#26728] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Command-Line Changes

- CockroachDB now computes the correct number of replicas on down nodes. Therefore, when [decommissioning nodes](../v2.0/remove-nodes.html) via the [`cockroach node decommission`](../v2.0/view-node-details.html) command, the `--wait=all` option no longer hangs indefinitely when there are down nodes. As a result, the `--wait=live` option is no longer necessary and has been deprecated. [#27158][#27158]

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a typo on **Node Map** screen of the Admin UI. [#27129][#27129]
- Fixed a rare crash on node [decommissioning](../v2.0/remove-nodes.html). [#26717][#26717]
- Joins across two [interleaved tables](../v2.0/interleave-in-parent.html) no longer return incorrect results under certain circumstances when the equality columns aren't all part of the interleaved columns. [#26832][#26832]
- Successes of time series maintenance queue operations are no longer counted as errors in the **Metrics** dashboard of the Admin UI. [#26820][#26820]
- Prevented a situation in which ranges repeatedly fail to perform a split. [#26944][#26944]
- Fixed a crash that could occur when distributed `LIMIT` queries were run on a cluster with at least one unhealthy node. [#26953][#26953]
- Failed [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html)s now begin to clean up partially imported data immediately and in a faster manner. [#26986][#26986]
- Alleviated a scenario in which a large number of uncommitted Raft commands could cause memory pressure at startup time. [#27024][#27024]
- The pg-specific syntax `SET transaction_isolation` now supports settings other than `SNAPSHOT`. This bug did not affect the standard SQL `SET TRANSACTION
  ISOLATION LEVEL`. [#27047][#27047]
- The `DISTINCT ON` clause is now reported properly in statement statistics. [#27222][#27222]
- Fixed a crash when trying to plan certain `UNION ALL` queries. [#27233][#27233]
- Commands are now abandoned earlier once a deadline has been reached. [#27215][#27215]
- Fixed a panic in [`IMPORT`](../v2.0/import.html) when creating a table using a sequence operation (e.g., `nextval()`) in a column's [DEFAULT](../v2.0/default-value.html) expression. [#27294][#27294]

### Doc Updates

- Added a tutorial on [benchmarking CockroachDB with TPC-C](../v2.0/performance-benchmarking-with-tpc-c.html). [#3281][#3281]
- Added `systemd` configs and instructions to [deployment tutorials](../v2.0/manual-deployment.html). [#3268][#3268]
- Updated the [Kubernetes tutorials](../v2.0/orchestrate-cockroachdb-with-kubernetes.html) to reflect that pods aren't "Ready" before init. [#3291][#3291]
