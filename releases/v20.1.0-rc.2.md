### SQL language changes

- The new ability to specify precision for [`TIME`/`TIMETZ`](../v20.1/time.html#precision) and [`INTERVAL`](../v20.1/interval.html#precision) data types is available only after finalizing an upgrade to v20.1. Previously, it was allowed to specify precision in clusters with mixed v19.2 and v20.1 nodes, but nodes running v19.2 would not respect the precision. [#47438][#47438]

### Command-line changes

- The new `--clock-device` flag for [`cockroach start`](../v20.1/cockroach-start) and [`cockroach start-single-node`](../v20.1/cockroach-start-single-node) allows HLC to use PTP user space API clock. [#47379][#47379]

### Bug fixes

- Remove a panic that would fire under normal operating conditions. Would result in "invalid truncation decision" error messages. [#47346][#47346]
- Fix a backwards incompatibility between RocksDB and Pebble that prevented RocksDB from opening a Pebble created WAL file under certain conditions. [#47383][#47383]
- Fix mishandling of truncated WAL records in Pebble which could prevent Pebble from opening a DB after a crash. [#47383][#47383]
- Fixed a bug in the new schema change GC job implementation causing unnecessary table descriptor lookups whenever any table was updated. [#47490][#47490]
- A bug that could cause a workload to stall under heavy load has been fixed. This stall was due to a deadlock that was introduced in an earlier v20.1 release.  Release justification: fixes a high-priority bug in existing functionality. The bug could result in full-workload deadlocks under heavy load. [#47493][#47493]
- Fixed a bug introduced with the new schema change job implementation in beta.3 that caused errors when rolling back a schema change to be swallowed. [#47499][#47499]
- A bug that could could trigger an assertion with the text "received X results, limit was Y" has been fixed. The underlying bug was only performance related and could not cause user-visible correctness violations.  Release justification: fixes a medium-priority bug in existing functionality. The bug could result in an assertion failure and a node crashing. Even though this was an old bug (present in many releases before v20.1), it became a lot easier to hit in v20.1 because we started performing ranged intent resolution more often due to implicit SELECT FOR UPDATE. [#47501][#47501]
