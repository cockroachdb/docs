### DB Console changes

- Non-`admin` users of the DB Console have regained the ability to view the [Cluster Overview page](../v20.2/ui-cluster-overview-page.html). Users without the [`admin` role](../v20.2/authorization.html#admin-role) will still see most data about their nodes, but information such as command-line arguments, environment variables, and IP addresses and DNS names of nodes will be hidden. [#71793][#71793]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an internal error with joins that are both `LATERAL` and `NATURAL`/`USING`. [#70806][#70806]
- Previously, in v21.1.x and earlier, CockroachDB could incorrectly read the data of a unique secondary index that used to be a primary index that was created via [`ALTER PRIMARY KEY`](../v20.2/alter-primary-key.html). This has been fixed. [#71589][#71589]
- CockroachDB now avoids dialing nodes in performance-critical code paths, which could cause substantial latency when encountering unresponsive nodes (e.g., when a VM or server was shut down). [#70487][#70487]
- CockroachDB could crash if network connectivity was impaired. The stack trace (in `cockroach-stderr.log`) would contain `server.(*statusServer).NodesUI` in that case. This has been fixed. [#71793][#71793]
- Fixed a panic that could occur with invalid GeoJSON input using `ST_GeomFromGeoJSON`/`ST_GeogFromGeoJSON`. [#71307][#71307]
- Fixed a bug which caused [`ALTER COLUMN TYPE`](../v20.2/alter-column.html) statements to fail when they should not have. [#71167][#71167]
- Connect timeout for grpc connections is now set to 20s to match the pre-v20.2 default value. [#71514][#71514]
- Fixed a bug which caused incorrect results for some queries that utilized a zigzag join. The bug could only reproduce on tables with at least two multi-column indexes with nullable columns. The bug was present since v19.2.0. [#71850][#71850]

### Performance improvements

- Reduced memory usage slightly during [`ANALYZE`](../v20.2/create-statistics.html) or [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v20.2/create-statistics.html) statements. [#71773][#71773]
