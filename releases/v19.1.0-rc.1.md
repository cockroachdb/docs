title: What&#39;s New in v19.1.0-rc.1
toc: true
summary: Additions and changes in CockroachDB version v19.1.0-rc.1 since version v19.1.0-beta.20190318
---

## April 2, 2019

In addition to bug fixes and various enterprise, SQL, and Admin UI enhancements, with this release, we also want to highlight the following feature:

- [**Prefer the nearest secondary index**](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#preferring-the-nearest-index): Given multiple identical [indexes](../v19.1/indexes.html) that have different locality constraints using [replication zones](../v19.1/configure-replication-zones.html), the cost-based optimizer will now prefer the index that is closest to the gateway node that is planning the query. In a properly configured geo-distributed cluster, this can lead to performance improvements due to improved data locality and reduced network traffic. This feature enables scenarios where reference data such as a table of postal codes can be replicated to different regions, and queries will use the copy in the same region.
- [**Encryption at Rest**](../v19.1/encryption.html#encryption-at-rest-enterprise): This feature, which provides transparent encryption of a node's data on the local disk, was introduced as an experimental in CockroachDB v2.1. With this release, it is no longer considered experimental and is ready for production use.

### Enterprise edition changes

- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) now support TLS connections to Kafka. [#35510][#35510]
- `CHANGEFEED`s now support SASL/PLAIN authentication when connecting to a Kafka sink. [#35800][#35800]
- `CHANGEFEED`s using Kafka now log information to help debug connection issues. [#35661][#35661]

### SQL language changes

- The [cost-based optimizer](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) now picks lookup-joins less frequently. [#35561][#35561]
- CockroachDB now reports uses of [CTEs](../v19.1/common-table-expressions.html) (`WITH ...`) and [subqueries](../v19.1/subqueries.html) in [diagnostics reporting](../v19.1/diagnostics-reporting.html), to guide future product planning. [#35650][#35650]
- It is now possible to specify a `HASH` / `MERGE` / `LOOKUP` [join hint](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html#join-hints) with cross joins (`CROSS <hint> JOIN`). [#35700][#35700]
- The output of [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.1/explain.html) now uses `hash-join` or `merge-join` instead of `join`. [#35688][#35688]
- Added an `EXPLAIN (opt, env)` option, which provides all relevant information for the planning of a query. [#35802][#35802]
- `transaction deadline exceeded` errors are now returned to the client with a retryable code. [#35284][#35284]
- Regular SQL errors that indicate erroneous SQL and for which CockroachDB does not yet populate a well-defined PostgreSQL error code will now be reported with code `XXUUU` instead of code `XX000`. [#35896][#35896] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Removed "experimental" from the names of the two existing automatic statistics [cluster settings](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html), and added two new cluster settings to control the target number of stale rows per table that will trigger a statistics refresh. [#36085][#36085] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Renamed the `experimental_reorder_joins_limit` [session variable](../v19.1/set-vars.html) to `reorder_joins_limit`. [#36085][#36085] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Changed [`SHOW JOBS`](../v19.1/show-jobs.html) to no longer display automatic statistics jobs. `SHOW AUTOMATIC JOBS` can now be used instead to view automatic statistics jobs. [#36112][#36112] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [cost-based optimizer](../v19.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) will now try to select the index having a leaseholder preference that is closest. [#36123][#36123] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [Computed columns](../v19.1/computed-columns.html) are now evaluated after rounding any decimal values in input columns. [#36128][#36128]
- Changed the generation algorithm for the OID column of tables in `pg_catalog`. As with previous CockroachDB releases, we guarantee that the OID values are consistent between `pg_catalog` tables (so that tables can be joined together), but we do not guarantee that they are stable across CockroachDB versions. Avoid storing them in client apps. [#33697][#33697]

### Command-line changes

- The output of [`cockroach debug zip`](../v19.1/debug-zip.html) now contains more information. [#36026][#36026] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Admin UI changes

- Improved progress reporting for `CREATE STATISTICS` jobs. [#35684][#35684]
- The **Queries per second** metric in the **Summary** bar now summarizes only the query types displayed in the **SQL Queries** graph and **Node Map**. [#35905][#35905] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The **Jobs** screen no longer shows automatic statistics by default. To see these jobs, you must now select **Auto-Statistics Creation** from the **Type** menu. [#36112][#36112]

### Bug fixes

- Increased speed of automatic statistic jobs on clusters with low load. [#35698][#35698]
- `CHANGEFEED`s connected to a slow sink now error instead of using unbounded amounts of memory. [#35745][#35745]
- Removed historical log entries from Raft snapshots that could lead to failed snapshots. [#35701][#35701]
- Fixed a bug in `RESTORE` where some unusual range boundaries in interleaved tables caused an error. [#36005][#36005]
- Fixed an error that occurred when creating statistics on tables with an inverted index. [#35982][#35982]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when comparing a value to the result of an `EXISTS`. [#36038][#36038]
- Fixed an error caused by incorrect calculation of null counts in `VALUES` clauses. [#35997][#35997]
- Reduced the occurrence of `ASYNC_WRITE_FAILURE` transaction retry errors, especially for the first insert into a newly-created table. [#36104][#36104]
- Fixed panics with the message "unexpected non-pending txn in augmentMetaLocked" caused by distributed queries encountering multiple errors. [#36041][#36041]
- `CHANGEFEED`s with `changefeed.push.enabled = true` (which is the default) no longer fail when run for longer than the garbage collection window of the source data and a range split occurred. They also now emit dramatically fewer duplicates. [#35981][#35981]
- Fixed panics caused by certain window functions that operate on tuples. [#36124][#36124]
- Prevented deadlocks when cancelling distributed queries in some cases. [#36122][#36122]
- Fixed a planning error that occurred with some `IN` expressions containing a list of constant and non-constant items. [#36134][#36134]
- Reduced risk of data unavailability during AZ/region failure. [#36133][#36133]
- Fixed a planning error that occurred when using set operations with multiple columns and many null values. [#36169][#36169]

### Performance improvements

- Improved performance of the TPC-C benchmark by pre-calculating statistics and injecting them during `IMPORT`. [#35940][#35940]
- Reduced the default frequency of automatic statistics refreshes. [#35992][#35992]
- Improved the selectivity estimation of range predicates during query optimization. [#36093][#36093]

### Build changes

- [Go 1.11.6](https://golang.org/dl/) is now the minimum required version necessary to build CockroachDB. [#35909][#35909] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

- Corrected the syntax for [per-replica replication zone constraints](../v19.1/configure-replication-zones.html#scope-of-constraints). [#4569](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4569)
