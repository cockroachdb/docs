### SQL language changes

- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v2.1/change-data-capture.html) will retry, rather than abort, in certain cases when failing to emit to a sink. [#30157][#30157]
- The new `ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE` statement can be used to add, modify, reset, and remove [replication zones](../v2.1/configure-replication-zones.html), with support for placeholders (`$1`, etc.) and for multiple executions. The new `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION` statement can be used to view existing replication zones. Clients should use these SQL statements instead of the `cockroach zone` sub-commands, which are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of CockroachDB. [#30173][#30173]
- Added the `2.0` value for both the `distsql` [session setting](../v2.1/set-vars.html) and the `sql.defaults.distsql` [cluster setting](../v2.1/cluster-settings.html), which instructs the database to use the 2.0 `auto` behavior for determining whether queries are distributed or run through the gateway node. [#30209][#30209]

### Command-line changes

- The various `cockroach zone` sub-commands are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of CockroachDB. Clients should use the SQL interface instead via `SHOW ZONE CONFIGURATION` and `ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE`. [#30173][#30173]
- Improved the output of [`cockroach node status`](../v2.1/view-node-details.html) to include separate `is_available` and `is_live` columns. [#30268][#30268]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`](../v2.1/debug-zip.html) command now also collects heap profiles that were generated and stored when there was high memory usage [#30281][#30281]

### Bug fixes

- The `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` [foreign key actions](../v2.1/foreign-key.html#foreign-key-actions) no longer cascade through `NULL`s. [#30122][#30122]
- Fixed the evaluation of `<tuple> IS NOT NULL` and `<tuple> IS NULL` comparison operations involving a non-null constant tuple to return `true` or `false` rather than `NULL`. [#30184][#30184]
- Fixed the occasional improper processing of the `WITH` operand with `IMPORT`/`EXPORT`/`BACKUP`/`RESTORE` and [common table expressions](../v2.1/common-table-expressions.html). [#30198][#30198]
- Fixed the return type of an array built from the results of a subquery to be `elementType[]` rather than `tuple{elementType}[]`. [#30237][#30237]
- Fixed a panic that was occurring when the cost-based optimizer was disabled and an array built from the results of a subquery was used in the `WHERE` clause of an outer query. [#30237][#30237]
- Fixed a panic that occurred when not all values were present in a composite foreign key. [#30153][#30153]
- Transaction size limit errors are no longer returned for transactions that have already committed. [#30304][#30304]

### Performance improvements

- Avoided unnecessary allocations when parsing prepared statement placeholders. [#30299][#30299]
- 1PC transactions now avoid writing transaction record and intents when pushed due to reads at a higher timestamp. [#30298][#30298]
