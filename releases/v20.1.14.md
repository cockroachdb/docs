### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug where some import failures would cause tables to stay `OFFLINE` when they should have been brought back to `PUBLIC`. [#61481][#61481]
- Fixed a bug where an invalid tuple comparison using `ANY` was causing an internal error. CockroachDB now returns "unsupported comparison operator". [#61725][#61725]
- Changed the behavior of the `kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration` [cluster setting](../v20.1/cluster-settings.html) when set to 0. This would make [follower reads](../v20.1/follower-reads.html) more aggressive instead of disabling them. Setting `kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration` to 0 will now disable routing requests to follower replicas. [#62442][#62442]
- Fixed a bug where [`RESTORE`](../v20.1/restore.html) using `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` of tables that included [foreign key constraints](../v20.1/foreign-key.html) from backups created by v19.x or earlier would lead to malformed schema metadata. [#62493][#62493]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur during planning when a query used the output of the `RETURNING` clause of an [`UPDATE`](../v20.1/update.html), and one or more of the columns in the `RETURNING` clause were from a table specified in the `FROM` clause of the `UPDATE` (i.e., not from the table being updated). [#62964][#62964]
- Dropping a [foreign key](../v20.1/foreign-key.html) that was added in the same transaction no longer triggers an internal error. This bug has been present since at least v20.1. [#62881][#62881]
- Fixed a bug where index backfill data might have been missed by [`BACKUP`](../v20.1/backup.html) in incremental backups. [#63303][#63303]

### Performance improvements

- SQL statistics collection has been made more efficient by avoiding an accidental heap allocation per row for some schemas. [#58199][#58199]
