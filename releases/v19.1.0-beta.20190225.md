title: What&#39;s New in v19.1.0-beta.20190225
toc: true
summary: Additions and changes in CockroachDB version v19.1.0-beta.20190225 since version v2.2.0-alpha.20190211

## February 25, 2019

Since our initial launch, Cockroach Labs has used semantic versioning in our release cycle guidelines. Two years, one major release, and n-patch fixes later, we're making the switch to Calendar Versioning. This means subscribers to our release notes will see quite the jump in today's version numbering, from last week's 2.1.5 to today's 19.1 beta. You can read more about the switch [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/calendar-versioning).

{{site.data.alerts.callout_danger}}This release has a deadlock bug that may result in nodes getting stuck in certain situations. This bug will be fixed in next week's beta. In the meantime, restart stuck nodes to recover.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### General changes

- Records for completed jobs are cleaned up automatically after two weeks. [#34725][#34725]
- [`SHOW JOBS`](../v19.1/show-jobs.html) now returns only running and recently finished jobs. Older jobs can still be inspected via the `crdb_internal.jobs` table. [#34829][#34829] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Enterprise edition changes

- `nodelocal://` storage paths for [`BACKUP`](../v19.1/backup.html), [`RESTORE`](../v19.1/restore.html), and [`IMPORT`](../v19.1/import.html) may include a node-ID in the Host part of the URI. It is not currently used (any node can get sent work and will look in its local IO directory) but will likely be required in the future. [#34797][#34797] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- [`CHANGEFEED`s](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html) targeting cloud sinks now partition files into date folders. [#34813][#34813] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The new `kv.rangefeed.concurrent_catchup_iterators` [cluster setting](../v19.1/cluster-settings.html) limits the number of rangefeed catchup iterators a store will allow concurrently before queueing. [#34890][#34890] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The [`CHANGEFEED` `experimental_avro`](../v19.1/create-changefeed.html#options) format now supports SQL columns of type `DATE`, `TIME`, `UUID`, `INET`, and `JSONB`. [#34918][#34918] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- Virtual tables in `pg_catalog` and `information_schema` now support `COMMENT ON` like regular tables. [#33697][#33697]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug that could cause a Raft log to grow very large, which in turn could prevent replication changes. [#34502][#34502]
- Prevented down nodes from obstructing log truncation on ranges they are a member of. This problem could cause replication to fail due to an overly large Raft log. [#34712][#34712]
- Fixed a panic when subtracting an array containing null from a JSON datum. [#34757][#34757]
- Fixed a panic during some `UNION ALL` operations with projections, filters, or renders directly on top of the `UNION ALL`. [#34762][#34762]
- Fixed a panic when the subquery in `UPDATE SET (a,b) = (...subquery...)` returns no rows. [#34804][#34804]
- Fixed a rare panic ("close of closed channel") when shutting down a server. [#34823][#34823]
- Fixed a deadlock during [`IMPORT`](../v19.1/import.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v19.1/restore.html) that caused all writes on a node to be stopped. [#34830][#34830]
- Fixed a panic during planning of certain complex join queries. [#34843][#34843]
- Fixed a panic when [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v19.1/create-statistics.html) is run on clusters containing nodes with different versions of CockroachDB. [#34842][#34842]
- Fixed a bug where servers would endlessly try to refresh table statistics on dropped tables. [#34884][#34884]
- CockroachDB now only lists tables in `pg_catalog.pg_tables`, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#34857][#34857]
- Fixed a panic when using [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v19.1/explain-analyze.html) with certain mutation queries. [#34991][#34991]

### Performance improvements

- [Subqueries](../v19.1/subqueries.html) used with `EXISTS` or as a scalar value now avoid fetching more rows than needed to decide the outcome. [#34801][#34801]

### Doc updates

- Documented the built-in [`ycsb` workload](../v19.1/cockroach-workload.html). [#4343][#4343]
