### General Changes

- A CockroachDB process now flushes its logs upon receiving `SIGHUP` instead of `SIGUSR1` as it did earlier. This is aimed to simplify the automation of process monitoring, test, and backup tools. [#23783][#23783]
- Information about [zone config](../v2.0/configure-replication-zones.html) usage is now included in [diagnostic reports](../v2.0/diagnostics-reporting.html). [#23750][#23750]

### Enterprise Edition Changes

- Added the `cloudstorage.timeout` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html) for import/export operations. [#23776][#23776]

### SQL Language Changes

- SQL features introduced in CockroachDB v2.0 cannot be used in clusters that are not [upgraded fully to v2.0](../v2.0/upgrade-cockroach-version.html). [#24013][#24013]
- Added an `escape` option to the `encode()` and `decode()` [built-in functions](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html). [#23781][#23781]
- Introduced a series of PostgreSQL-compatible, privilege-related [built-in functions](../v2.0/functions-and-operators.html). [#23839][#23839]
- Added the `pg_language` table to the `pg_catalog` virtual schema. [#23839][#23839]
- Added the `anyarray` type to the `pg_type` virtual schema. [#23836][#23836]
- [Retryable errors](../v2.0/transactions.html#error-handling) on schema change operations are now less likely to be returned to clients; more operations are retried internally. [#24050][#24050]

### Command-Line Changes

- Client commands now report a warning if the connection URL is specified by the `--url` as well as some other command-line flag. If you use the `--url` flag, other flags can fill in pieces missing from the URL.
- Added per-node heap profiles to the [`debug zip`](../v2.0/debug-zip.html) command output. [#23858][#23858]

### Admin UI Changes

- More debug pages are now locked down by the `server.remote_debugging.mode` [cluster setting](../v2.0/cluster-settings.html). [#24022][#24022]
- The **Network Diagnostics** report no longer crashes when the latencies are very small or on a single node cluster. [#23868][#23868]
- Fixed the flicker in the **Node Map** as data is being reloaded. [#23757][#23757]
- Fixed the text overflowing past the table cell boundaries on the **Jobs** page. [#23748][#23748]
- Updated the labels for the **Snapshots** graph on the **Replication** dashboard to be more specific. [#23742][#23742]
- Fixed a bug where graphs would not display on clusters with large numbers of nodes. [#24045][#24045]
- [Decommissioned nodes](../v2.0/remove-nodes.html) no longer appear in the node selection dropdown on the **Metrics** page. [#23800][#23800]
- Fixed a condition where a persistent trailing dip could appear in graphs for longer time periods. [#23874][#23874]

### Bug Fixes

- Redacted string values in debug API responses. [#24070][#24070]
- Old replicas are now garbage collected in a more timely fashion after a node has been offline for a long time (this bug only exists in recent v2.0 alpha/beta releases, not in v1.1). [#24066][#24066]
- Fixed a bug where some [inverted index](../v2.0/inverted-indexes.html) queries could return incorrect results. [#23968][#23968]
- Fixed the behavior of the `@>` operator with arrays and scalars. [#23969][#23969]
- [Inverted indexes](../v2.0/inverted-indexes.html) can no longer be hinted for inappropriate queries. [#23989][#23989]
- Enforced minimum privileges for the `admin` role. [#23935][#23935]
- A panic is now avoided if the SQL audit log directory does not exist when the node is started. [#23928][#23928]
- Supported Postgres syntax for `USING GIN`. [#23910][#23910]
- Fixed a bug where [`INSERT`](../v2.0/insert.html)/[`DELETE`](../v2.0/delete.html)/[`UPDATE`](../v2.0/update.html)/[`UPSERT`](../v2.0/upsert.html) may lose updates if run using `WITH` or the `[ ... ]` syntax. [#23895][#23895]
- Made sure that all built-in functions have a unique Postgres OID for compatibility. [#23880][#23880]
- Fixed an error message generated by the experimental SCRUB feature. [#23845][#23845]
- Fixed a bug where [`CREATE VIEW`](../v2.0/create-view.html) after [`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`](../v2.0/add-column.html) would fail to register the dependency on the newly added column. [#23845][#23845]
- Fixed crashes or incorrect results when combining an `OUTER JOIN` with a `VALUES` clause that contains only `NULL` values on a column (or other subqueries which result in a `NULL` column). [#23838][#23838]
- Fixed rare nil pointer exception in rebalance target selection. [#23807][#23807]
- The [`cockroach zone set`](../v2.0/configure-replication-zones.html) command will now automatically retry if it encounters an error while setting zone configurations. [#23782][#23782]
- Fixed a bug where closing a connection in the middle of executing a query sometimes crashed the server. [#23761][#23761]
- Fixed a bug where expressions could be mistakenly considered equal, despite their types being different. [#23722][#23722]
- Fixed a bug where the `RANGE COUNT` metric on the Cluster Overview page of the Admin UI could significantly undercount the number of ranges. [#23746][#23746]
- The client URL reported upon [`cockroach start`](../v2.0/start-a-node.html) now does not include the option `application_name`. [#23894][#23894]

### Performance Improvements

- Improved cluster performance during overload scenarios. [#23884][#23884]

### Doc Updates

- Added a local cluster tutorial demonstrating [JSON Support](../v2.0/demo-json-support.html). [#2716](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2716)
- Added full documentation for the [`VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`](../v2.0/validate-constraint.html) statement. [#2730](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/2730)
