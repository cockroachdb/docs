### Enterprise edition changes

- CHANGEFEEDs can now be configured with a minimum duration between emitted resolved timestamps. [#31008][#31008]
- CHANGEFEEDs now have limited and experimental support for the avro format. [#31143][#31143]
- Changefeeds now continue running when watched tables are ALTERed in ways that require a backfill. [#31165][#31165]


### SQL language changes

- EXPLAIN now always shows filter and join conditions. [#31186][#31186]
- Fix schema change rollback caused by GC TTL threshold error. [#31153][#31153]
- CockroachDB now supports CTEs inside views. [#31051][#31051]
- CockroachDB will now hint that internal errors should be reported as bugs by users. Additionally, internal errors are now collected internally and submitted (anonymized) with other node statistics when statistic collection is enabled. [#31272][#31272]
- It is now possible to force a specific index for DELETE or UPDATE. [#31279][#31279]
- Handle binary fields dumped by muysqldump v5.7.23 with `_binary` prefix. [#31305][#31305]
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE <statement> is now a valid equivalent of EXPLAIN ANALYZE (DISTSQL) <statement> [#31278][#31278]
- CockroachDB will now collect references to tables in `information_schema` and `pg_catalog` which are not yet implemented, and report them as telemetry if statistics reporting is enabled. This will help determine which features should be implemented next for compatibility. [#31357][#31357]

### Admin UI changes

- The "service latency: {90,99}th percentile" graphs on the Overview and SQL dashboard, as well as the P50 and P99 latency numbers in the time series area sidebar, now reflect latencies of both local and distributed queries. Previously, they only included local queries. [#31116][#31116]
- Links to documentation pages now open in a new tab. [#31132][#31132]
- Improve the view of databases with no tables. [#31231][#31231]
- Update jobs table to make each row expandable, allowing the user to see the error message for failed jobs. [#31237][#31237]

### Bug fixes

- Fix the `_admin/v1/enqueue_range` debug endpoint to always respect its node_id parameter. [#31087][#31087]
- CockroachDB now reports an unimplemented error when a common table expression containing INSERT/UPDATE/UPSERT/DELETE is not otherwise used in the remainder of the query. [#31051][#31051]
- CockroachDB does not silently ignore WITH clauses within parentheses any more. [#31051][#31051]
- Fix a rare scenario where a backup could incorrectly include a key for a transaction which was aborted. [#31316][#31316]
- Avoid repeatedly trying a replica that was found to be in the process of being added. [#31250][#31250]
- CockroachDB will no longer fail in unexpected ways or write invalid data when the type of input values provided to INSERT/UPSERT does not match the type of the target columns. [#31280][#31280]
- UPDATE now verifies the column constraints before CHECK constraints, for compatibility with PostgreSQL. [#31280][#31280]
- It is not possible any more to use not-fully-added-yet columns in the RETURNING clause of UPDATE statements. [#31280][#31280]
- CockroachDB does no longer incorrectly and silently accept a computed column on the left side of the assignment in a ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET clause. [#31280][#31280]
- CockroachDB does no longer incorrectly and silently accept a not-fully-added-yet column on the left side of the assignment in a ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET clause. [#31280][#31280]
- CockroachDB does not any more silently and incorrectly ignore the HAVING clause on SELECT without FROM. [#31347][#31347]
- The range debug page will now correctly handle cases in which there is no lease start or expiration time. [#31367][#31367]
