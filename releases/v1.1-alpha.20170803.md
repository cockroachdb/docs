### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- Table and column names in double quotes are now case-sensitive (same as in PostgreSQL). [#16884](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16884)
- The `SHOW SESSION TRACE` statement is now [`SHOW TRACE FOR SESSION`](../v1.1/show-vars.html). The `SET/SHOW TRACE` statements are now `SET/SHOW TRACING`. [#17033](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17033)
- It is no longer possible to drop columns in tables depended on by views. This is an overly-broad change to avoid schema changes that might break views; it will be narrowed in the future. [#17280](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17280)

### Build Changes

- It is now possible to build CockroachDB Enterprise Edition for Windows. [#17035](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17035)
- `make help` in a source checkout now prints documentation for the available build targets. [#17056](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17056)
- CockroachDB now uses gRPC version 1.5.0. [#17166](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17166)

### SQL Language Changes

- New statement [`CANCEL QUERY`](../v1.1/cancel-query.html) can be used to cancel a query in progress. [#17003](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17003)
- A limited form of one-dimensional `ARRAY` columns are now supported. [#16764](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16764) [#17231](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17231)
- `OUTER JOIN` statements now use the distributed SQL execution engine. [#17017](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17017)
- Some new syntactic forms for table references with aliases are now supported. [#17031](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17031)
- Strings within arrays are now formatted consistently with PostgreSQL. [#17069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17069)
- [Transactions](../v1.1/transactions.html) can now see their own changes to table schemas. [#16988](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16988)
- `RETURNING` clauses now accept fully-qualified table names. [#17293](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17293)
- Improved handling of null as a function argument. [#17264](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17264)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- A new `cockroach init` command can be used in place of starting one node without the `--join` flag. [#16371](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16371)

### Bug Fixes

- We removed a behavior causing statements in the first batch of a transaction to essentially defer their retryable errors until COMMIT; now, instead, we automatically retry statements in the first batch. As a result, fewer retryable errors should be encountered by COMMIT. [#16874](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16874)
- Fixed a race condition that could lead to serializability violations when requests race with a lease transfer. [#17109](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17109)
- Fixed a potential raft election issue during range splits. [#17051](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17051)
- Fixed a use-after-close for parallelized statements. [#17126](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17126)
- Fixed some panics in `ORDER BY INDEX`. [#17314](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17314)

### Performance Improvements

- The [`TRUNCATE`](../v1.1/truncate.html) statement now works by renaming the table and asynchronously garbage collecting the data, so it is much faster but no longer transactional (similar to PostgreSQL). [#17045](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17045)
- Fixed a memory leak in the HTTP layer. [#17080](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17080)
- Raft log truncations are now more efficient. [#16993](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16993)
- Fixed a regression that caused a node to talk to itself over the network. [#17196](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17196)
- Improved networking efficiency when tracing is disabled. [#17185](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17185)
- Reduced redundant trace messages. [#17182](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17182)
- Added a fast path for committing read-only transactions. [#17128](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17128)
- Memory footprints of various internal structures have been reduced. [#17089](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17089) [#17106](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17106) [#17138](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17138) [#17137](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17137) [#17152](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17152)
- Table descriptors are now passed by reference instead of value. [#17100](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17100)

### Doc Updates

- New RFCs: web session authentication ([#16829](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/16829)), buffering hash router ([#17105](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17105)
- Corrected information about how [`TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`](../v1.1/timestamp.html) works. Previous versions incorrectly said that they stored timestamps; they do not. Instead they simply display timestamps in the client's session time zone.
- [CockroachDB in Comparison](../v1.1/cockroachdb-in-comparison.html) was redesigned.

### Enterprise Edition Changes

- Replayed commands during a [`RESTORE`](../v1.1/restore.html) are now more efficient. [#17079](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17079)
- Backup jobs now checkpoint their progress every minutes. [#17070](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17070)
- Streamlined concurrency of [`RESTORE`](../v1.1/restore.html) operations, removing most tunable constants. [#17163](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17163)
- [`RESTORE`](../v1.1/restore.html) now rate-limits its disk I/O, reducing its impact on other traffic and improving performance on cloud platforms that throttle disk access. [#17239](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17239)
- The `enterprise.enabled` setting has been removed. [#17224](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/17224)
