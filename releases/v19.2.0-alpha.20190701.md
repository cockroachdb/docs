## July 01, 2019

This release contains enhancements and bug fixes to the 19.2.0 series, including:

- Experimental support for using [`IMPORT INTO`](../v19.2/import-into.html) to ingest CSV data into an existing table. Usage: `IMPORT INTO t(a, b) CSV DATA ('gs://acme-co/employees.csv')`.
- Adding non-null constraints to existing columns with `ALTER TABLE ... SET NOT NULL`.
- Various updates to improve Postgres compatibility.

### Backward-incompatible changes

- Integer and float columns of less than the max width will now be returned as their own type via the binary protocol. For example, an `int4` column will be returned in 32 bits over the pgwire binary protocol instead of 64 bits. [#37295][#37295]

### General changes

- Removed `kv.range_merge.manual_split_ttl` [cluster setting](../v19.2/cluster-settings.html). [#38004][#38004] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Go 1.12.5 is now required to build CockroachDB from source. {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### SQL language changes

- Added experimental support for using [`IMPORT INTO`](../v19.2/import-into.html) to ingest CSV data into an existing table. Usage: `IMPORT INTO t(a, b) CSV DATA ('gs://acme-co/employees.csv')`. [#37451][#37451]
- Implemented SQL support for timestamp objects to have an optional precision value. [#37920][#37920] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The logging format for statement execution (as enabled by `sql.trace.log_statement_execute`) and audit logs (as enabled by [`ALTER TABLE .. EXPERIMENTAL AUDIT SET ...`](../v19.2/experimental-audit.html)) is extended with one column that reports internal execution retries performed automatically by the server. The value `zero` is logged for the first retry attempt and thus corresponds to statements directly received from a client. [#38028][#38028] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added `WITH EXPIRATION` option for [`SPLIT AT`](../v19.2/split-at.html). [#38004][#38004] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `DISTINCT` keyword is now rejected when used in a window function. It was previously accepted, but ignored. [#37912][#37912]
- Added `UNSPLIT ALL` statement. [#38023][#38023] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- The `relam` column of the `pg_catalog` tables `pg_class` and `pg_index` is now filled in correctly. [#38164][#38164]
- CockroachDB now supports the special case `set timezone = 'utc'` as a special alias for `set timezone = 'UTC'`. The other time zone names are still case-sensitive as previously, pending resolution of issue #36864. [#38195][#38195] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Added support for `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL`, which adds a non-null constraint to an existing column. [#37554][#37554] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- `pg_get_constraintdef` now outputs `CHECK` constraints exactly the same way that Postgres does. [#38318][#38318]
- The `format_type` Postgres builtin now properly respects its second argument. [#38318][#38318]
- [`SHOW CREATE TABLE`](../v19.2/show-create.html) now prints foreign keys more like Postgres does. [#38318][#38318]
- The `pg_type_is_visible` builtin from Postgres is now implemented. [#38318][#38318]
- Casting an `int2vector` to a string now produces a Postgres-compatible result. [#38318][#38318]

### Command-line changes

- CockroachDB will now print out an error message and an informative hint if the time zone database is unusable. [#38197][#38197]

### Admin UI changes

- The snapshots graph on the [Replication page](../v19.2/admin-ui-replication-dashboard.html) in the Web UI now includes learner snapshots. [#38147][#38147] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Removed version information from login screen. [#38140][#38140]
- Added `Implicit Transaction` flag to [Statements](../v19.2/admin-ui-statements-page.html) and [Statement Details](../v19.2/admin-ui-statements-page.html#statement-details-page) page. [#36341][#36341] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- Checking the "skip should queue" checkbox in the Manual Enqueue Range [advanced debugging page](../v19.2/admin-ui-debug-pages.html) now works for the GC Queue. [#38249][#38249]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed help text that erroneously labeled [Encryption at Rest](../v19.2/encryption.html) as experimental. [#38228][#38228]
- The `max_retries` column in the statement statistics now properly displays the maximum number of times a statement was retried. [#38028][#38028]
- Previously, due to a bug when estimating result set sizes in the optimizer, queries involving `int` ranges that were very large could result in poor plans being generated. [#38036][#38036]
- Fixed a bug where MVCC value at future timestamp is returned after a transaction restart. [#38085][#38085]
- The YCSB workload will no longer ignore the `--db` option. [#38236][#38236]
- Localities in the `crdb_internal` tables were displayed JSON objects instead of strings. This format stripped them of their order, which is important in localities. This string format now exactly matches what is used in the command line for setting localities. [#37944][#37944]
- Fixed an incorrect type mismatch error when empty array values are used as default values (and potentially in other contexts). [#38294][#38294]
- Fixed a panic that could occur when decoding decimals as query parameters. [#38304][#38304]
- Nulls are now correctly handled by `MIN`, `SUM`, and `AVG` [aggregate functions](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html#aggregate-functions) when used as [window functions](../v19.2/window-functions.html). [#38110][#38110]
- Prevented a possible panic during [`JSONB`](../v19.2/jsonb.html) binary query parameter parsing. [#38346][#38346]
- Prevented a possible panic during [`INET`](../v19.2/inet.html) binary query parameter parsing. [#38346][#38346]
- Prevented a possible panic during [`VARBIT`](../v19.2/bit.html) binary query parameter parsing. [#38346][#38346]
- Prevented a possible panic during array binary query parameter parsing. [#38346][#38346]
- Fixed possible deadlock when storage engine write fails. [#38170][#38170]
- Fixed potential reappearance of deleted timeseries data, which could trip consistency checker. [#38170][#38170]
- Removed dependency on `sync_file_range` on Linux platforms on which it returns `ENOSYS`, such as WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). [#38170][#38170]

### Build changes

- A recent `libedit` is now bundled with CockroachDB, which fixes some line editing bugs in the CockroachDB console. On platforms that include libedit as part of the base system, like macOS and FreeBSD, CockroachDB no longer links against the system libedit. [#32623][#32623]

### Security

- Only check `CN` on first certificate in file. [#38163][#38163] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
