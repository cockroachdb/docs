### Security updates

- CockroachDB previously allowed non-authenticated access to privileged HTTP endpoints like `/_admin/v1/events`, which operate using `root` user permissions and can thus access (and sometimes modify) any and all data in the cluster. This security vulnerability has been patched by disallowing non-authenticated access to these endpoints and restricting access to admin users only.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Users who have built monitoring automation using these HTTP endpoints must modify their automation to work using an HTTP session token for an admin user.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Some Admin UI screens (e.g., Jobs) were previously incorrectly displayed using `root` user permissions, regardless of the logged-in user's credentials. This enabled insufficiently privileged users to access privileged information. This security vulnerability has been patched by using the credentials of the logged-in user to display all Admin UI screens.

- Privileged HTTP endpoints and certain Admin UI screens require an admin user. However, `root` is disallowed from logging in via HTTP and it is not possible to create additional admin accounts without an Enterprise license. This is further discussed [here](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/43870) and will be addressed in an upcoming patch revision.

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Users without an Enterprise license can create an additional admin user using a temporary evaluation license, until an alternative is available. A user created this way will persist beyond the license expiry.
    {{site.data.alerts.end}}

- Some Admin UI screens currently display an error or a blank page when viewed by a non-admin user (e.g., Table Details). This is a known limitation mistakenly introduced by the changes described above. This situation is discussed further [here](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/44033) and will be addressed in an upcoming patch revision. The list of UI pages affected includes but is not limited to:

  - Job details
  - Database details
  - Table details
  - Zone configurations

    {{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
    Users can access these Admin UI screens using an admin user until a fix is available.

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
"Special" endpoints are subject to the [cluster setting](../v2.1/cluster-settings.html) `server.remote_debugging.mode`. Unless the setting was customized, clients are only able to connect from the same machine as the node.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Admin UI changes

- Certain web UI pages (like the list of databases or tables) now restrict their content to match the privileges of the logged-in user. [#42910][#42910]
- The event log now presents all cluster settings changes, unredacted, when an admin user uses the page. [#42910][#42910]
- Customization of the UI by users is now only properly saved if the user has write privilege to `system.ui` (i.e., is an admin user). Also, all authenticated users share the same customizations. This is a known limitation and should be lifted in a future version. [#42910][#42910]
- Access to table statistics are temporarily blocked from access by non-admin users until further notice, for security reasons. [#42910][#42910]
- Certain debug pages have been blocked from non-admin users for security reasons. [#42910][#42910]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a rare data corruption bug in RocksDB caused by newer Linux kernel's handling of i_generation on certain file systems. [#41394][#41394]
- Fixed a bug causing the `cluster_logical_timestamp()` function to sometimes return incorrect results. [#41442][#41442]
- Fixed a bug causing rapid network disconnections to lead to cluster unavailability because goroutines waited for a connection which would never be initialized to send its first heartbeat. [#42166][#42166]
- Fixed a case where we incorrectly determine that a query (or part of a query) which contains an `IS NULL` constraint on a unique index column returns at most one row, possibly ignoring a `LIMIT 1` clause. [#42793][#42793]
- [`ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS`](../v2.1/alter-index.html) no longer fails when using an unqualified index name that does not match any existing index. Now it is a no-op. [#42841][#42841]
- The `CommandQueue` no longer holds on to buffers if they become too large. This prevents unbounded growth of memory that may never be reclaimed. [#42961][#42961]
- The `CommandQueue` now clears references to objects in its buffers to allow those objects to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. [#42961][#42961]
- Fixed a bug causing disk stalls to allow a node to continue heartbeating its liveness record and prevent other nodes from taking over its leases, despite being completely unresponsive. [#41734][#41734]
