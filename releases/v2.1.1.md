### SQL language changes

- Renamed the first column name returned by [`SHOW STATISTICS`](../v2.1/show-statistics.html) to `statistics_name`. [#32045][#32045] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- CockroachDB now de-correlates and successfully executes many queries containing correlated `EXISTS` subqueries. Previously, these queries caused a de-correlation error. [#32026][#32026] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}
- If [diagnostics reporting](../v2.1/diagnostics-reporting.html) is enabled, attempts to use `CREATE/DROP SCHEMA`, `DEFERRABLE`, `CREATE TABLE (LIKE ...)`, `CREATE TABLE ... WITH`, and the "fetch limit" parameter (e.g., via JDBC) will now be collected as telemetry to gauge demand for these currently unsupported features. Also, the name of SQL [built-in functions](../v2.1/functions-and-operators.html) will be collected upon evaluation errors. [#31638][#31638] {% comment %}doc{% endcomment %}

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a small memory leak when running distributed queries. [#31759][#31759]
- The `confkey` column of `pg_catalog.pg_constraint` no longer includes columns that were not involved in the foreign key reference. [#31895][#31895]
- The [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) no longer chooses the wrong index for a scan because of incorrect selectivity estimation. [#32011][#32011]
- Fixed a bug that caused transactions to unnecessarily return a "too large" error. [#31821][#31821]
- Fixed rare deadlocks during [`IMPORT`](../v2.1/import.html), [`RESTORE`](../v2.1/restore.html), and [`BACKUP`](../v2.1/backup.html). [#32016][#32016]
- Fixed a panic caused by incorrectly encoded Azure credentials. [#32016][#32016]
- Fixed a bug in the [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) that sometimes prevented passing ordering requirements through aggregations. [#32089][#32089]
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused invalid results or an "incorrectly ordered stream" error with streaming aggregations. [#32097][#32097]
- Fixed a bug that caused some queries with `DISTINCT ON` and `ORDER BY` with descending columns to return an error incorrectly. [#32175][#32175]
- Fixed a bug that caused queries with `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT ON` to return incorrect results or an "incorrectly ordered stream" error. Also improved performance of some aggregations by utilizing streaming aggregation in more cases. [#32175][#32175]
- Fixed a panic caused by an incorrect assumption in the SQL optimizer code that `ROWS FROM` clauses contain only functions. [#32168][#32168]
- Fix an error returned by [`cockroach node status`](../v2.1/view-node-details.html) after a new node is added to the cluster at a previous node's address. [#32198][#32198]
- Fixed a mismatch between lookup join planning and execution, which could cause queries to fail with the error "X lookup columns specified, expecting at most Y". [#31896][#31896]
- Fixed a bug that caused transactions to appear partially committed. CockroachDB was sometimes claiming to have failed to commit a transaction when some (or all) of its writes were actually persisted. [#32220][#32220]
- Prevented long stalls that can occur in contended transactions. [#32217][#32217]
- Non-superusers can no longer see other users' sessions and queries via the `ListSessions` and `ListLocalSessions` status server API methods. [#32284][#32284]
- The graphite metrics sender now collects and sends only the latest data point instead of all data points since startup. [#31888][#31888]

### Performance improvements

- Improved the performance of [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v2.1/as-of-system-time.html) queries by letting them use the table descriptor cache. [#31756][#31756]
- The [cost-based optimizer](../v2.1/cost-based-optimizer.html) can now determine more keys in certain cases involving unique indexes, potentially resulting in better plans. [#32044][#32044]
- Within a transaction, when performing a schema change after the table descriptor has been modified, accessing the descriptor should be faster. [#31756][#31756]

### Doc updates

- Corrected the flow control logic of the transaction code sample in the [Build a Java App with CockroachDB](../v2.1/build-a-java-app-with-cockroachdb.html) tutorial. [#4047](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4047)
- Expanded the [Running in a DaemonSet](../v2.1/kubernetes-performance.html#running-in-a-daemonset) instruction to cover both insecure and secure deployments. [#4037](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4037)
- Made it easier to find and link to specific [installation methods](../v2.1/install-cockroachdb.html), and updated the Homebrew instructions to note potential conflicts in cases where CockroachDB was previously installed using a different method. [#4032](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4032), [#4036](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4036)
- Updated the [`IMPORT`](../v2.1/import.html) documentation to cover [importing CockroachDB dump files](../v2.1/import.html#import-a-cockroachdb-dump-file). [#4029](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pull/4029)
