### Backwards-incompatible Changes

* Any databases using the [`DECIMAL`](../v1.0/decimal.html) type will need to be deleted and created from scratch. Columns of this type were encoded incorrectly in older beta releases. (Again! We apologize for the inconvenience.) [#5994](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5994)
* The [SQL function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) `transaction_timestamp_unique` has been removed in favor of the new `cluster_logical_timestamp` function described below.

### New Features

* [`ALTER TABLE`](../v1.0/alter-table.html) supports several new operations: `ADD COLUMN` with a
  default value
  ([#5759](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5759)),
  `ALTER COLUMN SET DEFAULT`, `ALTER COLUMN DROP DEFAULT`, and `ALTER
  COLUMN DROP NOT NULL`
  ([#5947](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5947))
* The `TIMESTAMPTZ` type is now accepted as an alias for [`TIMESTAMP`](../v1.0/timestamp.html)
  for compatibility with PostgreSQL; our `TIMESTAMP` type already
  supports time zones in the same way as PostgreSQL's `TIMESTAMPTZ`.
  [#5893](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5893)
* The [`STRING`](../v1.0/string.html) type now accepts a length parameter (e.g.,
  `STRING(50)`), similar to `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`.
  [#5918](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5918)
* The `LIMIT` clause now accepts placeholders.
  [#5977](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5977)
* The `RETURNING` clause of [`INSERT`](../v1.0/insert.html), [`DELETE`](../v1.0/delete.html), and [`UPDATE`](../v1.0/update.html)
  statements now accepts placeholders.
  [#5934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5934)
* When sending queries to the `cockroach sql` tool via `stdin`, a
  terminating semicolon is not required and instructions for
  interactive mode are no longer printed (similar to the existing
  behavior of `-e`).
  [#5988](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5988)
* The `experimental_uuid_v4()` [SQL function](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) has been renamed to
  `uuid_v4()`. The old name remains as a deprecated alias.
  [#5886](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5886)

### Performance Improvements

* Reduced the number of files created in the data directory, and fixed
  issues in which the process could run out of file descriptors.
  [#5888](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5888)
* Introduced a special fast path for transactions that are contained
  entirely within one range. [#5966](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5966)
* Reduced the number of unnecessary network round trips by ensuring
  that the range lease holder and the raft leader coincide.
  [#5973](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5973)

### Bug Fixes

* The gossip system no longer recommends redundant forwarding
  addresses, which could prevent the cluster from fully connecting.
  [#5901](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5901)
* Timestamps are now correctly reported in the network protocol as
  having time zone offsets.
  [#5909](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5909)
* Buffered data is now flushed to the network immediately on error.
  [#5909](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5909)
* Timeseries data no longer diverges across replicas.
  [#5905](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5905)

### Internal Changes

* [SQL functions](../v1.0/functions-and-operators.html) related to the current time (`now`,
  `current_timestamp`, `statement_timestamp`, `statement_timestamp`)
  now use the clock of the node that executed them instead of a
  timestamp derived from the internal hybrid logical clock. This means
  that these functions are less likely to produce duplicate values,
  but it is more likely for one transaction to see a timestamp that is
  less than a timestamp already seen in another transaction.
  Applications that require a globally monotonic timestamp-like value
  can use the new function `cluster_logical_timestamp` instead.
  [#5805](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5805)
* New HTTP endpoint `/debug/metrics` exposes internal metric data in
  JSON format.
  [#5894](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5894)
* [Logs](../v1.0/debug-and-error-logs.html) are no longer written to `stderr` by default, only to the
  `logs` subdirectory of the data directory.
  [#5979](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5979)
