### Security updates

- SQL admins can now use the new command `cockroach auth-session login` to create authentication tokens with an arbitrary expiration date. Operators should be careful to monitor `system.web_sessions` and enforce policy-mandated expirations using either SQL queries or the new command `cockroach auth-session logout`. [#44110][#44110]

### Enterprise edition changes

- CockroachDB is now more resilient to connection/network errors when reading data from HTTP servers. CockroachDB now attempts to resume the download after such errors. [#43687][#43687]

### SQL language changes

- [`extract()`](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html#special-syntax-forms) now supports millennium, century, decade, isoyear, isodow, and julian for [`date`](../v19.2/date.html), [`timestamp`](../v19.2/timestamp.html), and [`timestamptz`](../v19.2/timestamp.html). [`DATE_TRUNC`](../v19.2/functions-and-operators.html#date-and-time-functions) now supports millennium, century, and decade for `date`, `timestamp`, and `timestamptz`. [#42957][#42957]
- The output of [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.2/explain.html) now shows [joins](../v19.2/joins.html) where there are no equality columns as "cross" instead of "hash". Cross joins can be very expensive and should be avoided. [#43239][#43239]
- Previously, we error-coded duplicate foreign key constraint names with `42830` or `23503`. We changed this to be `42710` to be in line with PostgreSQL. [#43425][#43425]
- Vectorized queries that execute only on supported types, even if those types form part of a table with unsupported types are now run through the [vectorized engine](../v19.2/vectorized-execution.html). This would previously fall back to the row-by-row execution engine. [#44014][#44014]
- [`SHOW RANGES`](../v19.2/show-ranges.html) now shows locality information consistent with the range descriptor when node ID and store ID do not match. [#44312][#44312]
- Previously, CockroachDB would return an internal error when using [`SET TRACING`](../v19.2/set-vars.html#supported-variables) with any type other than `STRING`. Now it will return a regular query error. Additionally, boolean arguments are now supported in `SET TRACING`, and `true` is mapped to `on` mode of tracing whereas `false` is mapped to `off`. [#44347][#44347]

### Command-line changes

- Telemetry is now recorded for whenever the command [`cockroach demo`](../v19.2/cockroach-demo.html) is used. [#43819][#43819]
- Three new CLI commands, `cockroach auth-session login`, `cockroach auth-session list`, and `cockroach auth-session logout`, are now provided to facilitate the management of web sessions. The command `auth-session login` also produces a HTTP cookie which can be used by non-interactive HTTP-based database management tools. It also can generate such a cookie for the `root` user, who would not otherwise be able to do so using a web browser. [#44110][#44110]

### Admin UI changes

- We previously introduced a fix on the Admin UI to prevent non-admin users from executing queries. However, this inadvertently caused certain pages requiring table details not to display. This issue has now been resolved. [#44191][#44191]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug during planning for some queries that could cause an infinite loop and prevent the query from being cancelled. [#43082][#43082]
- Some incorrect issue links referenced by error hints have been corrected. [#43233][#43233]
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v19.2/explain.html) can now be used with statements that use [`AS OF SYSTEM TIME`](../v19.2/as-of-system-time.html). [#43303][#43303]
- This bug may cause jobs to be left indefinitely in `PENDING` state and never run. [#43421][#43421]
- Fixed a bug that prevented error reporting while generating shell autocomplete scripts. [#43507][#43507]
- Fixed a bug that prevented error reporting while reading from `crdb_internal.gossip_nodes` which could lead to lost writes or other undefined behavior. [#43502][#43502]
- Fixed a bug that prevented error reporting while generating plan diagrams rather than silently reporting no result. [#43506][#43506]
- Fixed a bug where an internal error could occur when [`CASE`](../v19.2/scalar-expressions.html#conditional-expressions) operator operating on distinct although compatible types was executed via the vectorized engine. For example, a query similar to `SELECT CASE WHEN false THEN 0:::INT2 ELSE 1:::INT8 END` previously would error out. [#43566][#43566]
- Fixed a bug that prevented error reporting while looking up table descriptors during schema changes and other transactional interactions with schema which could cause lost writes or other undefined behavior. [#43503][#43503]
- Fixed a bug in the parsing logic for `server.host_based_authentication.configuration`, where both single-character strings, and quoted strings containing spaces and separated by commas, were not properly parsed. [#43714][#43714]
- Fixed a bug that prevented error reporting while failing to parse URIs for multi-locality backup. [#43501][#43501]
- It is now possible to perform [`ALTER COLUMN SET/DROP NULL`](../v19.2/alter-column.html) on multiple (different) columns of the same table inside a single transaction. [#43645][#43645]
- CockroachDB now properly rejects [`ALTER COLUMN DROP NOT NULL`](../v19.2/alter-column.html) on a column that is part of the primary key. [#43645][#43645]
- Fixed a bug where errors from JSON containment operations were silently ignored rather than being returned. [#43505][#43505]
- Previously, CockroachDB could incorrectly report that some values were `NULL` when, in fact, they weren't. This could occur only when vectorized execution engine was used with `vectorize=experimental_on` and now has been fixed. [#43823][#43823]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB returned incorrect results for some aggregate functions when used as window functions with non-default window frame. Note that `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG`, as well as "pure" window functions (i.e., non-aggregates) were not affected. [#43854][#43854]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could, in some cases, return an internal error when running a query with a [`CAST`](../v19.2/data-types.html#data-type-conversions-and-casts) operation (`:::`) if vectorized execution engine is used. [#43890][#43890]
- A SQL row write that is re-issued after already succeeding will no longer throw a duplicate key error when the previous write in its transaction deleted the row. [#43937][#43937]
- On Linux machines, CockroachDB now respects the available memory limit set by the `cgroup` limits which apply to the cockroach process. [#43860][#43860]
- Fixed a bug in which a query shutdown mechanism could fail to fully cleanup the infrastructure when the query was executed via the vectorized engine and the query plan contained wrapped row-by-row processors. [#43944][#43944]
- Fixed a bug introduced in 19.2 that would allow foreign keys to use a unique index on the referenced columns that indexed more columns than were included in the columns used in the foreign key constraint, which allows potentially violating uniqueness in the referenced columns themselves. [#43796][#43796]
- A benign error previously logged at the `ERROR` level is now logged at the `INFO` level behind a verbosity(2) flag. This error might have been observed as `context canceled: readerCtx in Inbox stream handler`. [#44037][#44037]
- Fixed a bug where an internal error could occur when a query with an aggregate function `MIN` or `MAX` was executed via the vectorized engine when the input column was either `INT2` or `INT4` type. [#44055][#44055]
- `cockroach zip` now emits the `goroutine` file in the proper sub-directory when the corresponding call fails with an error. [#44065][#44065]
- `cockroach debug zip` is again able to operate correctly and continue to iterate over all nodes if one of the nodes does not deliver its goroutine dumps. It would previously prematurely and incorrectly stop with an incomplete dump; this was a regression introduced in 19.2. [#44065][#44065]
- [CDC](../v19.2/change-data-capture.html) is no longer susceptible to a bug where a resolved timestamp might be published before all events that precede it have been published in the presence of a range merge. [#44077][#44077]
- Converted a panic in `golang.org/x/text/language/tags.go` when using collated strings to an error. [#44117][#44117]
- CockroachDB now properly supports using `--url` with query options (e.g., `application_name`) but without specifying `sslmode`. The default of `sslmode=disable` is assumed in that case. [#44115][#44115]
- Removed statistics information from backup jobs' payload information to avoid excessive memory utilization when issuing commands such as [`SHOW JOBS`](../v19.2/show-jobs.html). [#44190][#44190]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB could crash in special circumstances when vectorized execution engine is used (it was more likely to happen if `vectorize=experimental_on` setting was used). [#44196][#44196]
- Fixed a planning bug related to `FULL` joins between single-row relations. [#44228][#44228]
- Fixed `CopyFrom requires empty destination` internal error. [#44245][#44245]
- Fixed a bug where multiple nodes attempted to populate the results for [`CREATE TABLE ... AS`](../v19.2/create-table-as.html) leading to duplicate rows. [#44300][#44300]
- Fixed internal error when mixed types are used with `BETWEEN`. [#44319][#44319]
- Fixed a bug where CockroachDB would return an internal error when a query with [`CASE`](../v19.2/scalar-expressions.html#conditional-expressions) operator that returns only `NULL` values was executed via the vectorized engine. [#44353][#44353]
- Fixed an internal error in the planner when table statistics were collected manually using `CREATE STATISTICS` for different columns at different times. [#44442][#44442]
- Fixed a bug that prevented `admin` users from using [`BACKUP`](../v19.2/backup.html), [`RESTORE`](../v19.2/restore.html), and [`IMPORT`](../v19.2/import.html). [#44456][#44456]
- Fixed incorrect plans in very rare cases involving filters that aren't constant folded in the optimizer but that can be evaluated statically when running a given query. [#44419][#44419]

### Performance improvements

- Adjusted the optimizer's cost of lookup join when the lookup columns aren't a key in the table. This will now cause some queries to switch to using a hash or merge join instead of a lookup join, improving performance in most cases. [#43059][#43059]
- Improved the estimated row count for some lookup joins during planning, leading to better plans in some cases. [#43364][#43364]
- A transaction running into multiple intents from an abandoned conflicting transaction now cleans them up more efficiently. [#43588][#43588]
- Histograms are now collected automatically for all boolean columns, resulting in better query plans in some cases. For tables that aren't being modified frequently, it might be necessary to run [`CREATE STATISTICS`](../v19.2/create-statistics.html) manually to see the benefit. [#44171][#44171]

#### Allocator

- The kv.allocator.range_rebalance_threshold setting, which controls how far away from the mean a store's range count must be before it is considered for rebalance, is now subject to a 2-replica minimum. If, for example, the mean number of replicas per store is 5.6 and the setting is 5%, the store will not be considered for rebalance unless the number of replicas is lesser than 3 or greater than 8. Previously, the bounds would have been 5 and 6. [#44359][#44359]
