## Support cycle

Each major release of CockroachDB goes through the following support cycle:

- **Maintenance Support:** For at least 365 days from the major release date, Cockroach Labs will produce regular patch releases that include critical security fixes and resolutions to problems identified by users.

- **Assistance Support:** Following the maintenance support period, Cockroach Labs will provide assistance support for at least an additional 180 days. During this period, the following guidelines will apply:
    - New enhancements and error corrections will not be made to the major release.
    - Cockroach Labs will direct customers to existing fixes/patches and workarounds applicable to the reported case.
    - Cockroach Labs may direct customers to [upgrade](../{{site.versions["stable"]}}/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) to a more current version of the product if a workaround does not exist.
    - Cockroach Labs will continue to add critical security fixes to the major release in the form of patch releases.

- **End of Life (EOL):** Following the assistance support period, Cockroach Labs will no longer provide any support for the release.

Cockroach Labs will notify you by mail or email 6 months in advance of a major release transitioning into **Assistance Support** or **EOL**.

## Current supported releases

As of v19.1, Cockroach Labs uses a three-component calendar versioning scheme. Prior releases use a different versioning scheme. For more details, see [Release Naming](index.html#release-naming).
