With this release, CockroachDB graduates from beta to a production-ready cloud-native database designed to power business at any scale from startup to enterprise. Years of development have gone into the capabilities included, from **distributed SQL** workloads with guaranteed ACID semantics, to **multi-active availability** with consistent consensus-based replication, to **simple and flexible deployment** and operations, to enterprise-scale **distributed, incremental backup and restore**.
