This tutorial shows you how build a simple Node.js application with CockroachDB using a PostgreSQL-compatible driver or ORM. We've tested and can recommend the [Node.js pg driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) and the [Sequelize ORM](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/), so those are featured here.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have already [installed CockroachDB](install-cockroachdb.html).

## Step 1. Install the Sequelize ORM

To install Sequelize, as well as a [CockroachDB Node.js package](https://github.com/cockroachdb/sequelize-cockroachdb) that accounts for some minor differences between CockroachDB and PostgreSQL, run the following command:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ npm install sequelize sequelize-cockroachdb
~~~

{% include app/common-steps.md %}

## Step 5. Run the Node.js code

The following code uses the [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/) ORM to map Node.js-specific objects to SQL operations. Specifically, `Account.sync({force: true})` creates an `accounts` table based on the Account model (or drops and recreates the table if it already exists), `Account.bulkCreate([...])` inserts rows into the table, and `Account.findAll()` selects from the table so that balances can be printed.

Copy the code or
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/docs/master/_includes/app/sequelize-basic-sample.js" download>download it directly</a>.

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ js
{% include app/sequelize-basic-sample.js %}
~~~

Then run the code:

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ node sequelize-basic-sample.js
~~~

The output should be:

~~~ shell
1 1000
2 250
~~~

To verify that the table and rows were created successfully, you can again use the [built-in SQL client](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html):

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure -e 'SHOW TABLES' --database=bank
~~~

~~~
+----------+
|  Table   |
+----------+
| accounts |
+----------+
(1 row)
~~~

{% include copy-clipboard.html %}
~~~ shell
$ cockroach sql --insecure -e 'SELECT id, balance FROM accounts' --database=bank
~~~

~~~
+----+---------+
| id | balance |
+----+---------+
|  1 |    1000 |
|  2 |     250 |
+----+---------+
(2 rows)
~~~
