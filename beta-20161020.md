### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

- Functions that return the current time (including `now()`) now return values of type `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` instead of `TIMESTAMP`, unless called from a context that expects the latter type. [#9618](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9618)

### SQL Language Changes

- Views can now be renamed with the `ALTER VIEW foo RENAME TO bar` command. [#9802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9802)
- Views can now be the target of `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands. [#9802](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9802)
- Tables in the `pg_catalog` database can now be accessed with unqualified names if no table of the same name exists in the current database. [#9927](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9927)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries now support the decimal format returned by `cluster_logical_timestamp()` for maximum precision. [#9934](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9934)
- `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` queries now support views. [#9724](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9724)
- The `CASCADE` option of `DROP TABLE` now drops views that depend on the table; it is now an error to attempt to drop a table with dependent views without either using this option or dropping the views first. [#9724](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9724)
- The `pg_catalog.pg_indexes` table is now supported. [#9869](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9869)
- `EXPLAIN` can now be used with `SHOW`, `HELP`, and `ALTER TABLE ... SPLIT`. [#10013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10013)

### Command-Line Interface Changes

- Improved error messages when a server is down or certificates are not configured correctly. [#9917](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9917)

### Performance Improvements

- Old time-series data is now garbage collected. [#9959](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9959)
- Reduced overhead of the internal time-series metric system. [#9889](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9889)
- Reduced impact of schema changes on regular queries. [#9798](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9798)
- Reduced memory used by bloom filters by 50%. [#10060](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10060)
- Schema changes now save their progress and can resume from their last checkpoint instead of from the beginning in the event of a node failure. [#10036](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10036)

### Bug Fixes

- `SET TIME ZONE 0` now sets the session time zone to UTC (other numbers already worked). [#9992](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/9992)
- `SHOW` commands for session variables now work correctly when prepared and executed separately. [#10013](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10013)
- Views defined with unqualified names now work correctly. [#10009](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10009)
- Columns that are a part of the primary key can now be renamed. [#10018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10018)
